<span id="line174"></span>was born in London on the 6th of December 1637, son of Amice Andros,
<span id="line175"></span>an adherent of Charles I., and the royal bailiff of the island of
<span id="line176"></span>Guernsey. He served for a short time in the army of Prince Henry of
<span id="line177"></span>Nassau, and in 1660-1662 was gentleman in ordinary to the queen of
<span id="line178"></span>Bohemia (Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I. of England). He then
<span id="line179"></span>served against the Dutch, and in 1672 was commissioned major in
<span id="line180"></span>what is said to have been the first English regiment armed with the
<span id="line181"></span>bayonet. In 1674 he became, by the appointment of the duke of York
<span id="line182"></span>(later James II.), governor of New York and the Jerseys, though his
<span id="line183"></span>jurisdiction over the Jerseys was disputed, and until his recall in
<span id="line184"></span>1681 to meet an unfounded charge of dishonesty and favouritism in
<span id="line185"></span>the collection of the revenues, he proved himself to be a capable
<span id="line186"></span>administrator, whose imperious disposition, however, rendered him
<span id="line187"></span>somewhat unpopular among the colonists. During a visit to England in
<span id="line188"></span>1678 he was knighted. In 1686 he became governor, with Boston as his
<span id="line189"></span>capital, of the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Dominion of New England,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> into which Massachusetts
<span id="line190"></span>(including Maine), Plymouth, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New
<span id="line191"></span>Hampshire were consolidated, and in 1688 his jurisdiction was extended
<span id="line192"></span>over New York and the Jerseys. But his vexatious interference with
<span id="line193"></span>colonial rights and customs aroused the keenest resentment, and on the
<span id="line194"></span>18th of April 1689, soon after news of the arrival of William, prince
<span id="line195"></span>of Orange, in England reached Boston, the colonists deposed and
<span id="line196"></span>arrested him. In New York his deputy, Francis Nicholson, was soon
<span id="line197"></span>afterwards deposed by Jacob Leisler (q.v.); and the inter-colonial
<span id="line198"></span>union was dissolved. Andros was sent to England for trial in 1690, but
<span id="line199"></span>was immediately released without trial, and from 1692 until 1698
<span id="line200"></span>he was governor of Virginia, but was recalled through the agency of
<span id="line201"></span>Commissary James Blair (q.v.), with whom he quarrelled. In 1693-1694
<span id="line202"></span>he was also governor of Maryland. From 1704 to 1706 he was governor
<span id="line203"></span>of Guernsey. He died in London in February 1714 and was buried at
<span id="line204"></span>St. Anne's, Soho.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line213"></span>northerly of the Cyclades, 6 m. S.E. of Euboea, and about 2 m. N.
<span id="line214"></span>of Tenos; it forms an eparchy in the modern kingdom of Greece. It is
<span id="line215"></span>nearly 25 m. long, and its greatest breadth is 10 m. Its surface is
<span id="line216"></span>for the most part mountainous, with many fruitful and well-watered
<span id="line217"></span>valleys. Andros, the capital, on the east coast, contains about 2000
<span id="line218"></span>inhabitants. The ruins of Palaeopolis, the ancient capital, are on the
<span id="line219"></span>west coast; the town possessed a famous temple, dedicated to Bacchus.
<span id="line220"></span>The island has about 18,000 inhabitants.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line221"></span>
<span id="line222"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The island in ancient times contained an Ionian population, perhaps
<span id="line223"></span>with an admixture of Thracian blood. Though originally dependent on
<span id="line224"></span>Eretria, by the 7th century B.C. it had become sufficiently prosperous
<span id="line225"></span>to send out several colonies to Chalcidice (Acanthus, Stageirus,
<span id="line226"></span>Argilus, Sane). In 480 it supplied ships to Xerxes and was
<span id="line227"></span>subsequently harried by the Greek fleet. Though enrolled in the Delian
<span id="line228"></span>League it remained disaffected towards Athens, and in 447 had to be
<span id="line229"></span>coerced by the settlement of a cleruchy. In 411 Andros proclaimed its
<span id="line230"></span>freedom and in 408 withstood an Athenian attack. As a member of the
<span id="line231"></span>second Delian League it was again controlled by a garrison and an
<span id="line232"></span>archon. In the Hellenistic period Andros was contended for as a
<span id="line233"></span>frontier-post by the two naval powers of the Aegean Sea, Macedonia and
<span id="line234"></span>Egypt. In 333 it received a Macedonian garrison from Antipater; in 308
<span id="line235"></span>it was freed by Ptolemy I. In the Chremonidean War (266-263) it passed
<span id="line236"></span>again to Macedonia after a battle fought off its shores. In 200 it
<span id="line237"></span>was captured by a combined Roman, Pergamene and Rhodian fleet, and
<span id="line238"></span>remained a possession of Pergamum until the dissolution of that
<span id="line239"></span>kingdom in 133 B.C. Before falling under Turkish rule, Andros was from
<span id="line240"></span>A.D. 1207 till 1566 governed by the families Zeno and Sommariva under
<span id="line241"></span>Venetian protection.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line248"></span>politicians of his time, was a pupil of Isocrates and a contemporary
<span id="line249"></span>of Demosthenes. He is known to us chiefly from the speech of
<span id="line250"></span>Demosthenes, in which he was accused of illegality in proposing
<span id="line251"></span>the usual honour of a crown to the Council of Five Hundred at the
<span id="line252"></span>expiration of its term of office. Androtion filled several important
<span id="line253"></span>posts, and during the Social War was appointed extraordinary
<span id="line254"></span>commissioner to recover certain arrears of taxes. Both Demosthenes and
<span id="line255"></span>Aristotle (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Rhet.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> iii. 4) speak favourably of his powers as
<span id="line256"></span>an orator. He is said to have gone into exile at Megara, and to have
<span id="line257"></span>composed an </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Atthis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, or annalistic account of Attica from the
<span id="line258"></span>earliest times to his own days (Pausanias vi. 7; x. 8). It is disputed
<span id="line259"></span>whether the annalist and orator are identical, but an Androtion
<span id="line260"></span>who wrote on agriculture is certainly a different person. Professor
<span id="line261"></span>Gaetano de Sanctis (in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>L'Attide di Androzione e un papiro
<span id="line262"></span>di Oxyrhynchos</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, Turin, 1908) attributes to Androtion, the

<span id="line316"></span>a measure), an instrument for measuring either the velocity or the
<span id="line317"></span>pressure of the wind. Anemometers may be divided into two classes, (1)
<span id="line318"></span>those that measure the velocity, (2) those that measure the pressure
<span id="line319"></span>of the wind, but inasmuch as there is a close connexion between the
<span id="line320"></span>pressure and the velocity, a suitable anemometer of either class will
<span id="line321"></span>give information about both these quantities.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line322"></span>
<span id="line323"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Velocity anemometers may again be subdivided into two classes, (1)
<span id="line324"></span>those which do not require a wind vane or weathercock, (2) those
<span id="line325"></span>which do. The Robinson anemometer, invented (1846) by Dr. Thomas Romney
<span id="line326"></span>Robinson, of Armagh Observatory, is the best-known and most generally
<span id="line327"></span>used instrument, and belongs to the first of these. It consists
<span id="line328"></span>of four hemispherical cups, mounted one on each end of a pair of
<span id="line329"></span>horizontal arms, which lie at right angles to each other and form a
<span id="line330"></span>cross. A vertical axis round which the cups turn passes through the
<span id="line331"></span>centre of the cross; a train of wheel-work counts up the number of
<span id="line332"></span>turns which this axis makes, and from the number of turns made in any
<span id="line333"></span>given time the velocity of the wind during that time is calculated.
<span id="line334"></span>The cups are placed symmetrically on the end of the arms, and it is
<span id="line335"></span>easy to see that the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented
<span id="line336"></span>to it; the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross also
<span id="line337"></span>faces the wind, but the pressure on it is naturally less, and hence
<span id="line338"></span>a continual rotation is produced; each cup in turn as it comes round
<span id="line339"></span>providing the necessary force. The two great merits of this anemometer
<span id="line340"></span>are its simplicity and the absence of a wind vane; on the other hand
<span id="line341"></span>it is not well adapted to leaving a record on paper of the actual
<span id="line342"></span>velocity at any definite instant, and hence it leaves a short but
<span id="line343"></span>violent gust unrecorded. Unfortunately, when Dr. Robinson first
<span id="line344"></span>designed his anemometer, he stated that no matter what the size of the
<span id="line345"></span>cups or the length of the arms, the cups always moved with one-third
<span id="line346"></span>of the velocity of the wind. This result was apparently confirmed by
<span id="line347"></span>some independent experiments, but it is very far from the truth, for
<span id="line348"></span>it is now known that the actual ratio, or factor as it is commonly
<span id="line349"></span>called, of the velocity of the wind to that of the cups depends very
<span id="line350"></span>largely on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have almost
<span id="line351"></span>any value between two and a little over three. The result has been
<span id="line352"></span>that wind velocities published in many official publications have
<span id="line353"></span>often been in error by nearly 50%.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line354"></span>
<span id="line355"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The other forms of velocity anemometer may be described as belonging
<span id="line356"></span>to the windmill type. In the Robinson anemometer the axis of rotation
<span id="line357"></span>is vertical, but with this subdivision the axis of rotation must
<span id="line358"></span>be parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal.
<span id="line359"></span>Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to
<span id="line360"></span>follow its changes, a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfil
<span id="line361"></span>the same purpose must be employed. This type of instrument is very
<span id="line362"></span>little used in England, but seems to be more in favour in France. In
<span id="line363"></span>cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as
<span id="line364"></span>in the ventilating shafts of mines and buildings for instance, these
<span id="line365"></span>anemometers, known, however, as air meters, are employed, and give
<span id="line366"></span>most satisfactory results.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line367"></span>
<span id="line368"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Anemometers which measure the pressure may be divided into the plate
<span id="line369"></span>and tube classes, but the former term must be taken as including a
<span id="line370"></span>good many miscellaneous forms. The simplest type of this form consists
<span id="line371"></span>of a flat plate, which is usually square or circular, while a wind
<span id="line372"></span>vane keeps this exposed normally to the wind, and the pressure of the
<span id="line373"></span>wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The distortion of the spring
<span id="line374"></span>determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate,
<span id="line375"></span>and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or leaves a record in
<span id="line376"></span>the ordinary way by means of a pen writing on a sheet of paper moved
<span id="line377"></span>by clockwork. Instruments of this kind have been in use for a long
<span id="line378"></span>series of years, and have recorded pressures up to and even exceeding
<span id="line379"></span>60 lb per sq. ft., but it is now fairly certain that these high values
<span id="line380"></span>are erroneous, and due, not to the wind, but to faulty design of the
<span id="line381"></span>anemometer.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line382"></span>
<span id="line383"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The fact is that the wind is continually varying in force, and while
<span id="line384"></span>the ordinary pressure plate is admirably adapted for measuring the
<span id="line385"></span>force of a steady and uniform wind, it is entirely unsuitable for
<span id="line386"></span>following the rapid fluctuations of the natural wind. To make
<span id="line387"></span>matters worse, the pen which records the motion of the plate is often
<span id="line388"></span>connected with it by an extensive system of chains and levers. A
<span id="line389"></span>violent gust strikes the plate, which is driven back and carried by
<span id="line390"></span>its own momentum far past the position in which a steady wind of the
<span id="line391"></span>same force would place it; by the time the motion has reached the pen
<span id="line392"></span>it has been greatly exaggerated by the springiness of the connexion,
<span id="line393"></span>and not only is the plate itself driven too far back, but also its
<span id="line394"></span>position is wrongly recorded by the pen; the combined errors act
<span id="line395"></span>the same way, and more than double the real maximum pressure may be
<span id="line396"></span>indicated on the chart.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line397"></span>
<span id="line398"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>A modification of the ordinary pressure-plate has recently been
<span id="line399"></span>designed. In this arrangement a catch is provided so that the plate
<span id="line400"></span>being once driven back by the wind cannot return until released by
<span id="line401"></span>hand; but the catch does not prevent the plate being driven back
<span id="line402"></span>farther by a gust stronger than the last one that moved it. Examples
<span id="line403"></span>of these plates are erected on the west coast of England, where in the
<span id="line404"></span>winter fierce gales often occur; a pressure of 30 lb per sq. ft. has
<span id="line405"></span>not been shown by them, and instances exceeding 20 lb are extremely
<span id="line406"></span>rare.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line407"></span>
<span id="line408"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Many other modifications have been used and suggested. Probably a
<span id="line409"></span>sphere would prove most useful for a pressure anemometer, since owing
<span id="line410"></span>to its symmetrical shape it would not require a weathercock. A small
<span id="line411"></span>light sphere hanging from the end of 30 or 40 ft. of fine sewing
<span id="line412"></span>cotton has been employed to measure the wind velocity passing over
<span id="line413"></span>a kite, the tension of the cotton being recorded, and this plan has
<span id="line414"></span>given satisfactory results.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line415"></span>
<span id="line416"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Lind's anemometer, which consists simply of a U tube containing liquid
<span id="line417"></span>with one end bent into a horizontal direction to face the wind, is
<span id="line418"></span>perhaps the original form from which the tube class of instrument
<span id="line419"></span>has sprung. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an
<span id="line420"></span>increase of pressure inside and also of course an equal increase in
<span id="line421"></span>all closed vessels with which the mouth is in airtight communication.
<span id="line422"></span>If it blows horizontally over the open end of a vertical tube it
<span id="line423"></span>causes a decrease of pressure, but this fact is not of any practical
<span id="line424"></span>use in anemometry, because the magnitude of the decrease depends on
<span id="line425"></span>the wind striking the tube exactly at right angles to its axis,
<span id="line426"></span>the most trifling departure from the true direction causing great
<span id="line427"></span>variations in the magnitude. The pressure tube anemometer (fig. 1)
<span id="line428"></span>utilizes the increased pressure in the open mouth of a straight tube
<span id="line429"></span>facing the wind, and the decrease
<span id="line430"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0003</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0003</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0003]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span> of pressure caused inside when the wind blows over a
<span id="line431"></span>ring of small holes drilled through the metal of a vertical tube which
<span id="line432"></span>is closed at the upper end. The pressure differences on which the
<span id="line433"></span>action depends are very small, and special means are required to
<span id="line434"></span>register them, but in the ordinary form of recording anemometer (fig.
<span id="line435"></span>2), any wind capable of turning the vane which keeps the mouth of the
<span id="line436"></span>tube facing the wind is capable of registration.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line437"></span>
<span id="line438"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the
<span id="line439"></span>exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling
<span id="line440"></span>or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any
<span id="line441"></span>convenient position, no matter how far from the external part. Two
<span id="line442"></span>connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as
<span id="line443"></span>though one connexion would serve, but the differences in pressure on
<span id="line444"></span>which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of
<span id="line445"></span>the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be
<span id="line446"></span>considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction
<span id="line447"></span>effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the
<span id="line448"></span>air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are
<span id="line449"></span>carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an
<span id="line450"></span>effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10 m. an hour; and the
<span id="line451"></span>opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may
<span id="line452"></span>entirely alter the registration.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line457"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The connexion between the velocity and the pressure of the wind is
<span id="line458"></span>one that is not yet known with absolute certainty. Many text-books on
<span id="line459"></span>engineering give the relation P=.005 </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>v</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span>2</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span> when P is the pressure
<span id="line460"></span>in lb per sq. ft. and </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>v</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> the velocity in miles per hour. The
<span id="line461"></span>history of this untrue relation is curious. It was given about the end
<span id="line462"></span>of the 18th century as based on some experiments, but with a footnote
<span id="line463"></span>stating that little reliance could be placed on it. The statement
<span id="line464"></span>without the qualifying note was copied from book to book, and at last
<span id="line465"></span>received general acceptance. There is no doubt that under average
<span id="line466"></span>conditions of atmospheric density, the .005 should be replaced by
<span id="line467"></span>.003, for many independent authorities using different methods have
<span id="line468"></span>found values very close to this last figure. It is probable that
<span id="line469"></span>the wind pressure is not strictly proportional to the extent of the
<span id="line470"></span>surface exposed. Pressure plates are generally of moderate size, from
<span id="line471"></span>a half or quarter of a sq. ft. up to two or three sq. ft., are round
<span id="line472"></span>or square, and for these sizes, and shapes, and of course for a flat
<span id="line473"></span>surface, the relation P=.003 </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>v</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span>2</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span> is fairly correct.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line474"></span>
<span id="line475"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In the tube anemometer also it is really the pressure that is
<span id="line476"></span>measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale.
<span id="line477"></span>In cases where the density of the air is not of average value, as on a
<span id="line478"></span>high mountain, or with an exceptionally low barometer for example, an
<span id="line479"></span>allowance must be made. Approximately 1<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>frac12;</span>% should be added to the

<span id="line493"></span>occur in Britain; the latter is found on chalk downs and limestone
<span id="line494"></span>pastures in some of the more southern and eastern counties. The plants
<span id="line495"></span>are perennial herbs with an underground rootstock, and radical, more
<span id="line496"></span>or less deeply cut, leaves. The elongated flower stem bears one or
<span id="line497"></span>several, white, red, blue or rarely yellow, flowers; there is an
<span id="line498"></span>involucre of three leaflets below each flower. The fruits often bear
<span id="line499"></span>long hairy styles which aid their distribution by the wind. Many
<span id="line500"></span>of the species are favourite garden plants; among the best known

<span id="line502"></span>tuberous-rooted plant, with parsley-like divided leaves, and large
<span id="line503"></span>showy poppy-like blossoms on stalks of from 6 to 9-in. high; the

<span id="line507"></span>of narrow petals. It is an old garden favourite, and of the double
<span id="line508"></span>forms there are named varieties. They grow best in a loamy soil,
<span id="line509"></span>enriched with well-rotted manure, which should be dug in below

<span id="line513"></span>when the leaves have ripened should be taken up into a dry room till

<span id="line551"></span>masters of 16th-century polyphony. Felice, the elder, was born about
<span id="line552"></span>1560, studied under G. M. Nanino and succeeded Palestrina in 1594 as
<span id="line553"></span>composer to the papal chapel. Several masses and motets of his are
<span id="line554"></span>printed in Proske's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Musica Divina</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and other modern anthologies,
<span id="line555"></span>and it is hardly too much to say that they are for the most part
<span id="line556"></span>worthy of Palestrina himself. The date of his death is conjecturally
<span id="line557"></span>given as 1630. His brother, Giovanni Francesco, was born about 1567,
<span id="line558"></span>and seems to have died about 1620. The occasional attribution of some
<span id="line559"></span>of his numerous compositions to his elder brother is a pardonable
<span id="line560"></span>mistake, if we may judge by the works that have been reprinted. But
<span id="line561"></span>the statement, which continues to be repeated in standard works of
<span id="line562"></span>reference, that <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>he was one of the first of Italians to use the
<span id="line563"></span>quaver and its subdivisions<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is incomprehensible. Quavers were common
<span id="line564"></span>property in all musical countries quite early in the 16th century, and
<span id="line565"></span>semiquavers appear in a madrigal of Palestrina published in 1574.
<span id="line566"></span>The two brothers are probably the latest composers who handled
<span id="line567"></span>16th-century music as their mother-language; suffering neither from

<span id="line569"></span>have learnt from the elder brother's master, Nanino, nor from the
<span id="line570"></span>necessity of preserving their purity of style by a mortified negative
<span id="line571"></span>asceticism. They wrote pure polyphony because they understood it and
<span id="line572"></span>loved it, and hence their work lives, as neither the progressive work
<span id="line573"></span>of their own day nor the reactionary work of their imitators could
<span id="line574"></span>live. The 12-part </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Stabat Mater</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> in the seventh volume of

<span id="line609"></span>cavity or sac which communicates with the interior of an artery and
<span id="line610"></span>contains blood. The walls of the cavity are formed either of the
<span id="line611"></span>dilated artery or of the tissues around that vessel. The dilatation
<span id="line612"></span>of the artery is due to a local weakness, the result of disease or
<span id="line613"></span>injury. The commonest cause is chronic inflammation of the inner coats
<span id="line614"></span>of the artery. The breaking of a bottle or glass in the hand is apt to
<span id="line615"></span>cut through the outermost coat of the artery at the wrist (radial)
<span id="line616"></span>and thus to cause a local weakening of the tube which is gradually
<span id="line617"></span>followed by dilatation. Also when an artery is wounded and the wound
<span id="line618"></span>in the skin and superficial structures heals, the blood may escape in
<span id="line619"></span>to the tissues, displacing them, and by its pressure causing them to
<span id="line620"></span>condense and form the sac-wall. The coats of an artery, when diseased,
<span id="line621"></span>may be torn by a severe strain, the blood escaping into the condensed
<span id="line622"></span>tissues which thus form the aneurysmal sac.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line626"></span>is false is not an aneurysm, any more than a false bank-note is

<span id="line629"></span>artery, the result, for instance, of gout, arduous, straining work, or
<span id="line630"></span>kidney-disease, and whose artery yields under cardiac pressure, has a

<span id="line633"></span>been bruised by a rifle bullet or grazed by a bayonet, and the
<span id="line634"></span>boy whose naked foot is pierced by a sharp nail, are apt to be the

<span id="line637"></span>induced to coagulate, or may of itself deposit layer upon layer of
<span id="line638"></span>pale clot, until the sac is obliterated. This laminar coagulation
<span id="line639"></span>by constant additions gradually fills the aneurysmal cavity and the
<span id="line640"></span>pulsation in the sac then ceases; contraction of the sac and its
<span id="line641"></span>contents gradually takes place and the aneurysm is cured. But in those
<span id="line642"></span>aneurysms which are </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>fusiform</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> dilatations of the vessel there is
<span id="line643"></span>but slight chance of such cure, for the blood sweeps evenly through it
<span id="line644"></span>without staying to deposit clot or laminated fibrine.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line645"></span>
<span id="line646"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In the treatment of aneurysm the aim is generally to lower the blood
<span id="line647"></span>pressure by absolute rest and moderated diet, but a cure is rarely
<span id="line648"></span>effected except by operation, which, fortunately, is now resorted
<span id="line649"></span>to more promptly and securely than was previously the case.
<span id="line650"></span>Without trying the speculative and dangerous method of treatment
<span id="line651"></span>by compression, or the application of an india rubber bandage, the
<span id="line652"></span>surgeon now without loss of time cuts down upon the artery, and
<span id="line653"></span>applies an aseptic ligature close above the dilatation. Experience
<span id="line654"></span>has shown that this method possesses great advantages, and that it has
<span id="line655"></span>none of the disadvantages which were formerly supposed to attend it.
<span id="line656"></span>Saccular dilatations of arteries which are the result of cuts or
<span id="line657"></span>other injuries are treated by tying the vessel above and below, and by
<span id="line658"></span>dissecting out the aneurysm. Popliteal, carotid and other aneurysms,
<span id="line659"></span>which are not of traumatic origin, are sometimes dealt with on this
<span id="line660"></span>plan, which is the old <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Method of Antyllus<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with modern aseptic
<span id="line661"></span>conditions. Speaking generally, if an aneurysm can be dealt with
<span id="line662"></span>surgically the sooner that the artery is tied the better. Less heroic
<span id="line663"></span>measures are too apt to prove painful, dangerous, ineffectual and
<span id="line664"></span>disappointing. For anturysm in the chest or abdomen (which cannot be
<span id="line665"></span>dealt with by operation) the treatment may be tried of injecting a
<span id="line666"></span>pure solution of gelatine into the loose tissues of the armpit, so
<span id="line667"></span>that the gelatine may find its way into the blood stream and increase
<span id="line668"></span>the chance of curative coagulation in the distant aneurysmal sac.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line886"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Angels<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor. These are probably
<span id="line887"></span>guardian angels, standing to the churches in the same relation that
<span id="line888"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>princes<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> in Daniel stand to the nations; practically the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>angels<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line889"></span>are personifications of the churches. A less likely view is that the
<span id="line890"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>angels<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> are the human representatives of the churches, the bishops or
<span id="line891"></span>chief presbyters. There seems, however, no parallel to such a use
<span id="line892"></span>of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>angel,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and it is doubtful whether the monarchical government of

<span id="line896"></span>angelology of the earlier apocalypses; and angels play an important
<span id="line897"></span>part in Gnostic systems and in the Jewish Midrashim and the Kabbala.
<span id="line898"></span>Religious thought about the angels during the middle ages was much
<span id="line899"></span>influenced by the theory of the angelic hierarchy set forth in the
<span id="line900"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>De Hierarchia Celesti</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, written in the 5th century in the
<span id="line901"></span>name of Dionysius the Areopagite and passing for his. The creeds and
<span id="line902"></span>confessions do not formulate any authoritative doctrine of angels; and
<span id="line903"></span>modern rationalism has tended to deny the existence of such beings,
<span id="line904"></span>or to regard the subject as one on which we can have no certain
<span id="line905"></span>knowledge. The principle of continuity, however, seems to require the
<span id="line906"></span>existence of beings intermediate between man and God.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1116"></span>Angelico da Fiesole is the name given to a far-famed painter-friar of
<span id="line1117"></span>the Florentine state in the 15th century, the representative, beyond
<span id="line1118"></span>all other men, of pietistic painting. He is often, but not accurately,
<span id="line1119"></span>termed simply <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Fiesole,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> which is merely the name of the town where he
<span id="line1120"></span>first took the vows; more often Fra Angelico. If we turn his compound
<span id="line1121"></span>designation into English, it runs thus<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>the Beatified Friar John the
<span id="line1122"></span>Angelic of Fiesole.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In his lifetime he was known no doubt simply as
<span id="line1123"></span>Fra Giovanni or Friar John; <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>The Angelic<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is a laudatory term which
<span id="line1124"></span>was assigned to him at an early date,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>we find it in use within thirty
<span id="line1125"></span>years after his death; and, at some period which is not defined in
<span id="line1126"></span>our authorities, he was beatified by due ecclesiastical process. His
<span id="line1127"></span>baptismal name was Guido, Giovanni being only his name in religion. He
<span id="line1128"></span>was born at Vicchio, in the Tuscan province of Mugello, of unknown
<span id="line1129"></span>but seemingly well-to-do parentage, in 1387 (not 1390 as sometimes
<span id="line1130"></span>stated); in 1407 he became a novice in the convent of S. Domenico at
<span id="line1131"></span>Fiesole, and in 1408 he took the vows and entered the Dominican order.
<span id="line1132"></span>Whether he had previously been a painter by profession is not certain,
<span id="line1133"></span>but may be pronounced probable. The painter named Lorenzo Monaco may
<span id="line1134"></span>have contributed to his art-training, and the influence of the Sienese
<span id="line1135"></span>school is discernible in his work.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1138"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>According to Vasari, the first paintings of this artist
<span id="line1139"></span>were in the Certosa of Florence; none such exist there now. His
<span id="line1140"></span>earliest extant performances, in considerable number, are at Cortona,
<span id="line1141"></span>whither he was sent during his novitiate, and here apparently he spent
<span id="line1142"></span>all the opening years of his monastic life. His first works executed
<span id="line1143"></span>in fresco were probably those, now destroyed, which he painted in the
<span id="line1144"></span>convent of S. Domenico in this city; as a fresco-painter, he may have
<span id="line1145"></span>worked under, or as a follower of, Gherardo Starnina. From 1418
<span id="line1146"></span>to 1436 he was back at Fiesole; in 1436 he was transferred to the
<span id="line1147"></span>Dominican convent of S. Marco in Florence, and in 1438 undertook to
<span id="line1148"></span>paint the altarpiece for the choir, followed by many other works;
<span id="line1149"></span>he may have studied about this time the renowned frescoes in the
<span id="line1150"></span>Brancacci chapel in the Florentine church of the Carmine and also the
<span id="line1151"></span>paintings of Orcagna. In or about 1445 he was invited by the pope to
<span id="line1152"></span>Rome. The pope who reigned from 1431 to 1447 was Eugenius IV., and he
<span id="line1153"></span>it was who in 1445 appointed another Dominican friar, a colleague of
<span id="line1154"></span>Angelico, to be archbishop of Florence. If the story (first told by
<span id="line1155"></span>Vasari) is true<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>that this appointment was made at the suggestion of
<span id="line1156"></span>Angelico only after the archbishopric had been offered to himself, and
<span id="line1157"></span>by him declined on the ground of his inaptitude for so elevated and
<span id="line1158"></span>responsible a station<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Eugenius, and not (as stated by Vasari) his
<span id="line1159"></span>successor Nicholas V., must have been the pope who sent the invitation
<span id="line1160"></span>and made the offer to Fra Giovanni, for Nicholas only succeeded in
<span id="line1161"></span>1447. The whole statement lacks authentication, though in itself
<span id="line1162"></span>credible enough. Certain it is that Angelico was staying in Rome in
<span id="line1163"></span>the first half of 1447; and he painted in the Vatican the Cappella del
<span id="line1164"></span>Sacramento, which was afterwards demolished by Paul III. In June
<span id="line1165"></span>1447 he proceeded to Orvieto, to paint in the Cappella Nuova of the
<span id="line1166"></span>cathedral, with the co-operation of his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli. He
<span id="line1167"></span>afterwards returned to Rome to paint the chapel of Nicholas V. In
<span id="line1168"></span>this capital he died in 1455, and he lies buried in the church of the
<span id="line1169"></span>Minerva.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1170"></span>
<span id="line1171"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>According to all the accounts which have reached us, few men on
<span id="line1172"></span>whom the distinction of beatification has been conferred could
<span id="line1173"></span>have deserved it more nobly than Fra Giovanni. He led a holy and
<span id="line1174"></span>self-denying life, shunning all advancement, and was a brother to
<span id="line1175"></span>the poor; no man ever saw him angered. He painted with unceasing
<span id="line1176"></span>diligence, treating none but sacred subjects; he never retouched
<span id="line1177"></span>or altered his work, probably with a religious feeling that such as
<span id="line1178"></span>divine providence allowed the thing to come, such it should remain. He
<span id="line1179"></span>was wont to say that he who illustrates the acts of Christ should
<span id="line1180"></span>be with Christ. It is averred that he never handled a brush without
<span id="line1181"></span>fervent prayer and he wept when he painted a Crucifixion. The Last
<span id="line1182"></span>Judgment and the Annunciation were two of the subjects he most
<span id="line1183"></span>frequently treated.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1184"></span>
<span id="line1185"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Bearing in mind the details already given as to the dates of Fra
<span id="line1186"></span>Giovanni's sojournings in various localities, the reader will be able
<span id="line1187"></span>to trace approximately the sequence of the works which we now proceed
<span id="line1188"></span>to name as among his most important productions. In Florence, in the
<span id="line1189"></span>convent of S. Marco (now converted into a national museum), a series
<span id="line1190"></span>of frescoes, beginning towards 1443; in the first cloister is the
<span id="line1191"></span>Crucifixion with St. Dominic kneeling; and the same treatment recurs on
<span id="line1192"></span>a wall near the dormitory; in the chapterhouse is a third Crucifixion,
<span id="line1193"></span>with the Virgin swooning, a composition of twenty life-sized
<span id="line1194"></span>figures<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the red background, which has a strange and harsh effect, is
<span id="line1195"></span>the misdoing of some restorer; an <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Annunciation,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> the figures of about
<span id="line1196"></span>three-fourths of life-size, in a dormitory; in the adjoining passage,
<span id="line1197"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Virgin enthroned,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with four saints; on the wall of a cell,
<span id="line1198"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Coronation of the Virgin,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with Saints Paul, Thomas Aquinas,
<span id="line1199"></span>Benedict, Dominic, Francis and Peter Martyr; two Dominicans welcoming
<span id="line1200"></span>Jesus, habited as a pilgrim; an <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Adoration of the Magi<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>; the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Marys
<span id="line1201"></span>at the Sepulchre.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> All these works are later than the altarpiece which
<span id="line1202"></span>Angelico painted (as before mentioned) for the choir connected
<span id="line1203"></span>with this convent, and which is now in the academy of Florence; it
<span id="line1204"></span>represents the Virgin with Saints Cosmas and Damian (the patrons of
<span id="line1205"></span>the Medici family), Dominic, Peter, Francis, Mark, John Evangelist and
<span id="line1206"></span>Stephen; the pediment illustrated the lives of Cosmas and Damian, but
<span id="line1207"></span>it has long been severed from the main subject. In the Uffizi gallery,
<span id="line1208"></span>an altarpiece, the Virgin (life-sized) enthroned, with the Infant and
<span id="line1209"></span>twelve angels. In S. Domenico, Fiesole, a few frescoes, less fine than
<span id="line1210"></span>those in S. Marco; also an altarpiece in tempera of the Virgin and
<span id="line1211"></span>Child between Saints Peter, Thomas Aquinas, Dominic and Peter Martyr,
<span id="line1212"></span>now much destroyed. The subject which originally formed the predella
<span id="line1213"></span>of this picture has, since 1860, been in the National Gallery, London,
<span id="line1214"></span>and worthily represents there the hand of the saintly painter. The
<span id="line1215"></span>subject is a Glory, Christ with the banner of the Resurrection, and
<span id="line1216"></span>a multitude of saints, including, at the extremities, the saints or
<span id="line1217"></span>beati of the Dominican order; here are no fewer than 266 figures
<span id="line1218"></span>or portions of figures, many of them having names inscribed. This
<span id="line1219"></span>predella was highly lauded by Vasari; still more highly another
<span id="line1220"></span>picture which used to form an altarpiece in Fiesole, and which now
<span id="line1221"></span>obtains world-wide celebrity in the Louvre<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Coronation of the
<span id="line1222"></span>Virgin,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with eight predella subjects of the miracles of St. Dominic.
<span id="line1223"></span>For the church of Santa Trinita, Florence, Angelico executed a
<span id="line1224"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Deposition from the Cross,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and for the church of the Angeli, a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Last
<span id="line1225"></span>Judgment,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> both now in the Florentine academy; for S. Maria Novella, a
<span id="line1226"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Coronation of the Virgin,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with a predella in three sections, now
<span id="line1227"></span>in the Uffizi,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>this again is one of his masterpieces. In Orvieto
<span id="line1228"></span>cathedral he painted three triangular divisions of the ceiling,
<span id="line1229"></span>portraying respectively Christ in a glory of angels, sixteen saints
<span id="line1230"></span>and prophets, and the virgin and apostles: all these are now much
<span id="line1231"></span>repainted and damaged. In Rome, in the Chapel of Nicholas V., the acts
<span id="line1232"></span>of Saints Stephen and Lawrence; also various figures of saints, and
<span id="line1233"></span>on the ceiling the four evangelists. These works of the painter's
<span id="line1234"></span>advanced age, which have suffered somewhat from restorations, show
<span id="line1235"></span>vigour superior to that of his youth, along with a more adequate
<span id="line1236"></span>treatment of the architectural perspectives. Naturally, there are a
<span id="line1237"></span>number of works currently attributed to Angelico, but not really his;
<span id="line1238"></span>for instance, a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>St Thomas with the Madonna's girdle,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> in the Lateran
<span id="line1239"></span>museum, and a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Virgin enthroned,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> in the church of S. Girolamo,
<span id="line1240"></span>Fiesole. It has often been said that he commenced and frequently
<span id="line1241"></span>practised as an illuminator; this is dubious and a presumption arises
<span id="line1242"></span>that illuminations executed by Giovanni's brother, Benedetto, also
<span id="line1243"></span>a Dominican, who died in 1448, have been ascribed to the more famous
<span id="line1244"></span>artist. Benedetto may perhaps have assisted Giovanni in the frescoes
<span id="line1245"></span>at S. Marco, but nothing of the kind is distinctly traceable. A folio
<span id="line1246"></span>series of engravings from these paintings was published in Florence,
<span id="line1247"></span>in 1852. Along with Gozzoli already mentioned, Zanobi Strozzi and
<span id="line1248"></span>Gentile da Fabriano are named as pupils of the Beato.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1249"></span>
<span id="line1250"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>We have spoken of Angelico's art as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>pietistic<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>; this is in fact
<span id="line1251"></span>its predominant character. His visages have an air of rapt suavity,
<span id="line1252"></span>devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is
<span id="line1253"></span>intensely attractive to some minds and realizes beyond rivalry a
<span id="line1254"></span>particular ideal<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>that of ecclesiastical saintliness and detachment
<span id="line1255"></span>from secular fret and turmoil. It should not be denied that he did not
<span id="line1256"></span>always escape the pitfalls of such a method of treatment, the faces
<span id="line1257"></span>becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which
<span id="line1258"></span>hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; on other minds,
<span id="line1259"></span>therefore, and these some of the most masculine and resolute, he
<span id="line1260"></span>produces little genuine impression. After allowing for this, Angelico
<span id="line1261"></span>should nevertheless be accepted beyond cavil as an exalted typical
<span id="line1262"></span>painter according to his own range of conceptions, consonant with his
<span id="line1263"></span>monastic calling, unsullied purity of life and exceeding devoutness.
<span id="line1264"></span>Exquisite as he is in his special mode of execution, he undoubtedly
<span id="line1265"></span>falls far short, not only of his great naturalist contemporaries such
<span id="line1266"></span>as Masaccio and Lippo Lippi, but even of so distant a precursor as
<span id="line1267"></span>Giotto, in all that pertains to bold or life-like invention of a
<span id="line1268"></span>subject or the realization of ordinary appearances, expressions and
<span id="line1269"></span>actions<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the facts of nature, as distinguished from the aspirations or
<span id="line1270"></span>contemplations of the spirit. Technically speaking, he had much finish
<span id="line1271"></span>and harmony of composition and colour, without corresponding
<span id="line1272"></span>mastery of light and shade, and his knowledge of the human frame
<span id="line1273"></span>was restricted. The brilliancy and fair light scale of his tints
<span id="line1274"></span>is constantly remarkable, combined with a free use of gilding; this
<span id="line1275"></span>conduces materially to that celestial character
<span id="line1276"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0008</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0008</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0008]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span> which so pre-eminently distinguishes his pictured

<span id="line1319"></span>Mariae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. It consists of three texts describing the mystery, recited

<span id="line1321"></span>This devotion is recited in the Catholic Church three times daily,

<span id="line1339"></span>became coadjutor to the prince bishop of Breslau. He died at Breslau
<span id="line1340"></span>on the 9th of July 1677. In 1657 Silesius published under the title

<span id="line1342"></span>verliebten Psyche</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1657), a collection of 205 hymns, the most
<span id="line1343"></span>beautiful of which, such as, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Liebe, die du mich zum Bilde deiner

<span id="line1348"></span>This is a collection of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Reimspr<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>uuml;</span>che<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or rhymed distichs embodying
<span id="line1349"></span>a strange mystical pantheism drawn mainly from the writings of Jakob
<span id="line1350"></span>B<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>hme and his followers. Silesius delighted specially in the subtle
<span id="line1351"></span>paradoxes of mysticism. The essence of God, for instance, he held to
<span id="line1352"></span>be love; God, he said, can love nothing inferior to himself; but he
<span id="line1353"></span>cannot be an object of love to himself without going out, so to speak,
<span id="line1354"></span>of himself, without manifesting his infinity in a finite form; in
<span id="line1355"></span>other words, by becoming man. God and man are therefore essentially
<span id="line1356"></span>one.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1405"></span>Maine-et-Loire, 191 m. S.W. of Paris by the Western railway to Nantes.
<span id="line1406"></span>Pop. (1906) 73,585. It occupies rising ground on both banks of the
<span id="line1407"></span>Maine, which are united by three bridges. The surrounding district is
<span id="line1408"></span>famous for its flourishing nurseries and market gardens. Pierced
<span id="line1409"></span>with wide, straight streets, well provided with public gardens, and
<span id="line1410"></span>surrounded by ample, tree-lined boulevards, beyond which lie new
<span id="line1411"></span>suburbs, Angers is one of the pleasantest towns in France. Of its
<span id="line1412"></span>numerous medieval buildings the most important is the cathedral of
<span id="line1413"></span>St. Maurice, dating in the main from the 12th and 13th centuries.
<span id="line1414"></span>Between the two flanking towers of the west fa<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ccedil;</span>ade, the spires of
<span id="line1415"></span>which are of the 16th century, rises a central tower of the same
<span id="line1416"></span>period. The most prominent feature of the fa<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ccedil;</span>ade is the series of
<span id="line1417"></span>eight warriors carved on the base of this tower. The vaulting of the
<span id="line1418"></span>nave takes the form of a series of cupolas, and that of the choir and
<span id="line1419"></span>transept is similar. The chief treasures of the church are its rich
<span id="line1420"></span>stained glass (12th, 13th and 15th centuries) and valuable tapestry
<span id="line1421"></span>(14th to 18th centuries). The bishop's palace which adjoins the
<span id="line1422"></span>cathedral contains a fine synodal hall of the 12th century. Of the
<span id="line1423"></span>other churches of Angers, the principal are St. Serge, an abbey-church
<span id="line1424"></span>of the 12th and 15th centuries, and La Trinit<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span> (12th century). The
<span id="line1425"></span>prefecture occupies the buildings of the famous abbey of St. Aubin; in
<span id="line1426"></span>its courtyard are elaborately sculptured arcades of the 11th and 12th
<span id="line1427"></span>centuries, from which period dates the tower, the only survival of the
<span id="line1428"></span>splendid abbey-church. Ruins of the old churches of Toussaint (13th
<span id="line1429"></span>century) and Notre-Dame du Ronceray (11th century) are also to be
<span id="line1430"></span>seen. The castle of Angers, an imposing building girt with towers and
<span id="line1431"></span>a moat, dates from the 13th century and is now used as an armoury.
<span id="line1432"></span>The ancient hospital of St. Jean (12th century) is occupied by an
<span id="line1433"></span>archaeological museum; and the Logis Barrault, a mansion built about
<span id="line1434"></span>1500, contains the public library, the municipal museum, which has
<span id="line1435"></span>a large collection of pictures and sculptures, and the Mus<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>e David,
<span id="line1436"></span>containing works by the famous sculptor David d'Angers, who was a
<span id="line1437"></span>native of the town. One of his masterpieces, a bronze statue of Ren<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>
<span id="line1438"></span>of Anjou, stands close by the castle. The H<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ocirc;</span>tel de Pinc<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span> or d'Anjou
<span id="line1439"></span>(1523-1530) is the finest of the stone mansions of Angers; there are
<span id="line1440"></span>also many curious wooden houses of the 15th and 16th centuries. The
<span id="line1441"></span>palais de justice, the Catholic institute, a fine theatre, and

<span id="line1443"></span>the modern buildings of the town. Angers is the seat of a bishopric,
<span id="line1444"></span>dating from the 3rd century, a prefecture, a court of appeal and a
<span id="line1445"></span>court of assizes. It has a tribunal of first instance, a tribunal
<span id="line1446"></span>of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce,
<span id="line1447"></span>a branch of the Bank of France and several learned societies. Its
<span id="line1448"></span>educational institutions include ecclesiastical seminaries, a lyc<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>e,
<span id="line1449"></span>a preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy, a university with
<span id="line1450"></span>free faculties (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>facult<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>s libres</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) of theology, law, letters and
<span id="line1451"></span>science, a higher school of agriculture, training colleges, a school
<span id="line1452"></span>of arts and handicrafts and a school of fine art. The prosperity of
<span id="line1453"></span>the town is largely due to the great slate-quarries of the vicinity,
<span id="line1454"></span>but the distillation of liqueurs from fruit, cable, rope and
<span id="line1455"></span>thread-making, and the manufacture of boots and shoes, umbrellas and
<span id="line1456"></span>parasols are leading industries. The weaving of sail-cloth and woollen
<span id="line1457"></span>and other fabrics, machine construction, wire-drawing, and manufacture
<span id="line1458"></span>of sparkling wines and preserved fruits are also carried on. The chief
<span id="line1459"></span>articles of commerce, besides slate and manufactured goods, are hemp,
<span id="line1460"></span>early vegetables, fruit, flowers and live-stock.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1465"></span>invasions of the Northmen in 845 and the succeeding years, and of the
<span id="line1466"></span>English in the 12th and 15th centuries; the Huguenots took it in 1585,
<span id="line1467"></span>and the Vendean royalists were repulsed near it in 1793. Till the

<span id="line1486"></span>was of noble Frankish parentage, and educated at the palace school
<span id="line1487"></span>under Alcuin. As the friend and adviser of the emperor's son, Pippin,
<span id="line1488"></span>he assisted for a while in the government of Italy, and was later
<span id="line1489"></span>sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794 and 796.
<span id="line1490"></span>Although he was the father of two children by Charlemagne's daughter,
<span id="line1491"></span>Bertha, one of them named Nithard, we have no authentic account of
<span id="line1492"></span>his marriage, and from 790 he was abbot of St. Riquier, where his
<span id="line1493"></span>brilliant rule gained for him later the renown of a saint. Angilbert,
<span id="line1494"></span>however, was little like the true medieval saint; his poems reveal
<span id="line1495"></span>rather the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the
<span id="line1496"></span>closest intimacy with the imperial family. He accompanied Charlemagne
<span id="line1497"></span>to Rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814.
<span id="line1498"></span>Angilbert was the Homer of the emperor's literary circle, and was
<span id="line1499"></span>the probable author of an epic, of which the fragment which has been
<span id="line1500"></span>preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between
<span id="line1501"></span>Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from Virgil, Ovid, Lucan and
<span id="line1502"></span>Fortunatus, composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius,
<span id="line1503"></span>and exhibits a true poetic gift. Of the shorter poems, besides the
<span id="line1504"></span>greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the Avars
<span id="line1505"></span>(796), an epistle to David (Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a
<span id="line1506"></span>delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house
<span id="line1507"></span>surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The
<span id="line1508"></span>reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name
<span id="line1509"></span>occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his

<span id="line1525"></span>attack of angina pectoris usually comes on with a sudden seizure
<span id="line1526"></span>of pain, felt at first over the region of the heart, but radiating
<span id="line1527"></span>through the chest in various directions, and frequently extending down
<span id="line1528"></span>the left arm. A feeling of constriction and of suffocation accompanies
<span id="line1529"></span>the pain, although there is seldom actual difficulty in breathing.
<span id="line1530"></span>When the attack comes on, as it often does, in the course of some
<span id="line1531"></span>bodily exertion, the sufferer is at once brought to rest, and during
<span id="line1532"></span>the continuance of the paroxysm experiences the most intense agony.
<span id="line1533"></span>The countenance becomes pale, the surface of the body cold, the pulse
<span id="line1534"></span>feeble, and death appears to be imminent, when suddenly the attack
<span id="line1535"></span>subsides and complete relief is obtained. The duration of a paroxysm
<span id="line1536"></span>rarely exceeds two or three minutes, but it may last for a longer
<span id="line1537"></span>period. The attacks are apt to recur on slight exertion, and even in
<span id="line1538"></span>aggravated cases without any such exciting cause. Occasionally the
<span id="line1539"></span>first seizure proves fatal; but more commonly death takes place as the
<span id="line1540"></span>result of repeated attacks. Angina pectoris is extremely rare under
<span id="line1541"></span>middle life, and is much more common in males than in females. It
<span id="line1542"></span>must always be regarded as a disorder of a very serious nature. In the
<span id="line1543"></span>treatment of the paroxysm, nitrite of amyl has now replaced all other
<span id="line1544"></span>remedies. It can be carried by the patient in the form of nitrite
<span id="line1545"></span>of amyl pearls, each pearl containing the dose prescribed by the
<span id="line1546"></span>physician. Kept in this way the drug does not lose strength. As soon
<span id="line1547"></span>as the pain begins the patient crushes a pearl in his handkerchief
<span id="line1548"></span>and holds it to his mouth and nose. The relief given in this way is
<span id="line1549"></span>marvellous and usually takes place within a very few seconds. In the
<span id="line1550"></span>rare cases where this drug does not relieve, hypodermic injections
<span id="line1551"></span>of morphia are used. But on account of the well-known dangers of this
<span id="line1552"></span>drug, it should only be administered by a medical man. To prevent
<span id="line1553"></span>recurrence of the attacks something may be done by scrupulous
<span id="line1554"></span>attention to the general health, and by the avoidance of mental and
<span id="line1555"></span>physical strain. But the most important preventive of all is <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>bed,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line1556"></span>of which fourteen days must be enforced on the least premonition of
<span id="line1557"></span>anginal pain.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1560"></span>common condition must be mentioned that has now universally received
<span id="line1561"></span>the name of pseudo-angina. This includes the praecordial pains which
<span id="line1562"></span>very closely resemble those of true angina. The essential difference
<span id="line1563"></span>lies in the fact that pseudo-angina is independent of structural
<span id="line1564"></span>disease of the heart and coronary arteries. In true angina there is
<span id="line1565"></span>some condition within the heart which starts the stimulus sent to the
<span id="line1566"></span>nerve centres. In pseudo-angina the starting-point is not the heart
<span id="line1567"></span>but some peripheral or visceral nerve. The impulse passes thence to
<span id="line1568"></span>the medulla, and so reaching the sensory centres starts a feeling of
<span id="line1569"></span>pain that radiates into the chest or down the arm. There are three
<span id="line1570"></span>main varieties:<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>(1) the reflex, (2) the vaso-motor, (3) the toxic.
<span id="line1571"></span>The reflex is by far the most common, and is generally due
<span id="line1572"></span>to irritation from one of the abdominal organs. An attack of
<span id="line1573"></span>pseudo-angina may be agonizing, the pain radiating through the chest
<span id="line1574"></span>and into the left arm, but the patient does not usually assume the
<span id="line1575"></span>motionless attitude of true angina, and the duration of the seizure is
<span id="line1576"></span>usually much longer. The treatment is that of the underlying neurosis
<span id="line1577"></span>and the prognosis is a good one, sudden death not occurring.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1584"></span>Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of that one of
<span id="line1585"></span>his primary divisions of the plant kingdom, which included flowering
<span id="line1586"></span>plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, in contradistinction to
<span id="line1587"></span>his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic
<span id="line1588"></span>fruits<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as
<span id="line1589"></span>a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Linnaeus
<span id="line1590"></span>with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of
<span id="line1591"></span>the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its
<span id="line1592"></span>modern scope only became possible after Robert Brown had established
<span id="line1593"></span>in 1827 the existence of truly naked seeds in the Cycadeae and
<span id="line1594"></span>Coniferae, entitling them to be correctly called Gymnosperms. From
<span id="line1595"></span>that time onwards, so long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual,
<span id="line1596"></span>reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was
<span id="line1597"></span>used antithetically by botanical writers, but with varying limitation,
<span id="line1598"></span>as a group-name for other </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0010</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0010</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0010]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span> dicotyledonous plants. The advent in 1851 of
<span id="line1599"></span>Hofmeister's brilliant discovery of the changes proceeding in the
<span id="line1600"></span>embryo-sac of flowering plants, and his determination of the correct
<span id="line1601"></span>relationships of these with the Cryptogamia, fixed the true position
<span id="line1602"></span>of Gymnosperms as a class distinct from Dicotyledons, and the
<span id="line1603"></span>term Angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable
<span id="line1604"></span>designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than
<span id="line1605"></span>Gymnosperms, and as including therefore the classes of Dicotyledons
<span id="line1606"></span>and Monocotyledons. This is the sense in which the term is nowadays
<span id="line1607"></span>received and in which it is used here.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1608"></span>
<span id="line1609"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The trend of the evolution of the plant kingdom has been in the
<span id="line1610"></span>direction of the establishment of a vegetation of fixed habit and
<span id="line1611"></span>adapted to the vicissitudes of a life on land, and the Angiosperms are
<span id="line1612"></span>the highest expression of this evolution and constitute the dominant
<span id="line1613"></span>vegetation of the earth's surface at the present epoch. There is no
<span id="line1614"></span>land-area from the poles to the equator, where plant-life is possible,
<span id="line1615"></span>upon which Angiosperms are not found. They occur also abundantly in
<span id="line1616"></span>the shallows of rivers and fresh-water lakes, and in less number in
<span id="line1617"></span>salt lakes and in the sea; such aquatic Angiosperms are not, however,
<span id="line1618"></span>primitive forms, but are derived from immediate land-ancestors.
<span id="line1619"></span>Associated with this diversity of habitat is great variety in general
<span id="line1620"></span>form and manner of growth. The familiar duckweed which covers the
<span id="line1621"></span>surface of a pond consists of a tiny green <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>thalloid<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> shoot, one, that
<span id="line1622"></span>is, which shows no distinction of parts<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>stem and leaf, and a
<span id="line1623"></span>simple root growing vertically downwards into the water. The great
<span id="line1624"></span>forest-tree has a shoot, which in the course perhaps of hundreds of
<span id="line1625"></span>years, has developed a wide-spreading system of trunk and branches,
<span id="line1626"></span>bearing on the ultimate twigs or branchlets innumerable leaves, while
<span id="line1627"></span>beneath the soil a widely-branching root-system covers an area of
<span id="line1628"></span>corresponding extent. Between these two extremes is every conceivable
<span id="line1629"></span>gradation, embracing aquatic and terrestrial herbs, creeping, erect or
<span id="line1630"></span>climbing in habit, shrubs and trees, and representing a much greater
<span id="line1631"></span>variety than is to be found in the other subdivision of seed-plants,
<span id="line1632"></span>the Gymnosperms.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1635"></span>
<span id="line1636"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In internal structure also the variety of tissue-formation far exceeds
<span id="line1637"></span>that found in Gymnosperms (see PLANTS: </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Anatomy</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>). The vascular
<span id="line1638"></span>bundles of the stem belong to the collateral type, that is to say,
<span id="line1639"></span>the elements of the wood or xylem and the bast or phloem stand side
<span id="line1640"></span>by side on the same radius. In the larger of the two great groups into
<span id="line1641"></span>which the Angiosperms are divided, the Dicotyledons, the bundles in
<span id="line1642"></span>the very young stem are arranged in an open ring, separating a central
<span id="line1643"></span>pith from an outer cortex. In each bundle, separating the xylem and
<span id="line1644"></span>phloem, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue, known as
<span id="line1645"></span>cambium; by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles
<span id="line1646"></span>(interfascicular cambium) a complete ring is formed, and a regular
<span id="line1647"></span>periodical increase in thickness results from it by the development
<span id="line1648"></span>of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem soon
<span id="line1649"></span>becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists, and forms the great bulk
<span id="line1650"></span>of the stem and branches of the woody perennial. Owing to differences
<span id="line1651"></span>in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end
<span id="line1652"></span>of the season, the wood is marked out in transverse section into
<span id="line1653"></span>concentric rings, one for each season of growth<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the so-called annual
<span id="line1654"></span>rings. In the smaller group, the Monocotyledons, the bundles are more
<span id="line1655"></span>numerous in the young stem and scattered through the ground tissue.
<span id="line1656"></span>Moreover they contain no cambium and the stem once formed increases in
<span id="line1657"></span>diameter only in exceptional cases.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1660"></span>
<span id="line1661"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>As in Gymnosperms, branching is monopodial; dichotomy or the forking
<span id="line1662"></span>of the growing point into two equivalent branches which replace the
<span id="line1663"></span>main stem, is absent both in the case of the stem and the root. The
<span id="line1664"></span>leaves show a remarkable variety in form (see LEAF), but are generally
<span id="line1665"></span>small in comparison with the size of the plant; exceptions occur in
<span id="line1666"></span>some Monocotyledons, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>e.g.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> in the Aroid family, where in some
<span id="line1667"></span>genera the plant produces one huge, much-branched leaf each season.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1668"></span>
<span id="line1669"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In rare cases the main axis is unbranched and ends in a flower,
<span id="line1670"></span>as, for instance, in the tulip, where scale-leaves, forming the
<span id="line1671"></span>underground bulb, green foliage-leaves and coloured floral leaves are
<span id="line1672"></span>borne on one and the same axis. Generally, flowers are formed only
<span id="line1673"></span>on shoots of a higher order, often only on the ultimate branches of
<span id="line1674"></span>a much branched system. A potential branch or bud, either foliage or
<span id="line1675"></span>flower, is formed in the axil of each leaf; sometimes more than one
<span id="line1676"></span>bud arises, as for instance in the walnut, where two or three stand in
<span id="line1677"></span>vertical series above each leaf. Many of the buds remain dormant, or
<span id="line1678"></span>are called to development under exceptional circumstances, such as
<span id="line1679"></span>the destruction of existing branches. For instance, the clipping of
<span id="line1680"></span>a hedge or the lopping of a tree will cause to develop numerous buds
<span id="line1681"></span>which may have been dormant for years. Leaf-buds occasionally arise
<span id="line1682"></span>from the roots, when they are called adventitious; this occurs in many
<span id="line1683"></span>fruit trees, poplars, elms and others. For instance, the young shoots
<span id="line1684"></span>seen springing from the ground around an elm are not seedlings but
<span id="line1685"></span>root-shoots. Frequently, as in many Dicotyledons, the primary root,
<span id="line1686"></span>the original root of the seedling, persists throughout the life of
<span id="line1687"></span>the plant, forming, as often in biennials, a thickened tap-root, as
<span id="line1688"></span>in carrot, or in perennials, a much-branched root system. In many
<span id="line1689"></span>Dicotyledons and most Monocotyledons, the primary root soon perishes,
<span id="line1690"></span>and its place is taken by adventitious roots developed from the stem.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1693"></span>
<span id="line1694"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The most characteristic feature of the Angiosperm is the flower, which
<span id="line1695"></span>shows remarkable variety in form and elaboration, and supplies the
<span id="line1696"></span>most trustworthy characters for the distinction of the series and
<span id="line1697"></span>families or natural orders, into which the group is divided. The
<span id="line1698"></span>flower is a shoot (stem bearing leaves) which has a special form
<span id="line1699"></span>associated with the special function of ensuring the fertilization of
<span id="line1700"></span>the egg and the development of fruit containing seed. Except where
<span id="line1701"></span>it is terminal it arises, like the leaf-shoot, in the axil of a leaf,
<span id="line1702"></span>which is then known as a bract. Occasionally, as in violet, a flower
<span id="line1703"></span>arises singly in the axil of an ordinary foliage-leaf; it is then
<span id="line1704"></span>termed axillary. Generally, however, the flower-bearing portion of
<span id="line1705"></span>the plant is sharply distinguished from the foliage leaf-bearing or
<span id="line1706"></span>vegetative portion, and forms a more or less elaborate branch-system
<span id="line1707"></span>in which the bracts are small and scale-like. Such a branch-system is
<span id="line1708"></span>called an inflorescence. The primary function of the flower is to bear
<span id="line1709"></span>the spores. These, as in Gymnosperms, are of two kinds, microspores
<span id="line1710"></span>or pollen-grains, borne in the stamens (or microsporophylls) and
<span id="line1711"></span>megaspores, in which the egg-cell is developed, contained in the
<span id="line1712"></span>ovule, which is borne enclosed in the carpel (or megasporophyll). The
<span id="line1713"></span>flower may consist only of spore-bearing leaves, as in willow, where
<span id="line1714"></span>each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels. Usually,
<span id="line1715"></span>however, other leaves are present which are only indirectly concerned
<span id="line1716"></span>with the reproductive process, acting as protective organs for the
<span id="line1717"></span>sporophylls or forming an attractive envelope. These form the perianth
<span id="line1718"></span>and are in one series, when the flower is termed monochlamydeous, or
<span id="line1719"></span>in two series (dichlamydeous). In the second case the outer series
<span id="line1720"></span>(calyx of sepals) is generally green and leaf-like, its function being
<span id="line1721"></span>to protect the rest of the flower, especially in the bud; while
<span id="line1722"></span>the inner series (corolla of petals) is generally white or brightly
<span id="line1723"></span>coloured, and more delicate in structure, its function being to
<span id="line1724"></span>attract the particular insect or bird by agency of which pollination
<span id="line1725"></span>is effected. The insect, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., is attracted by the colour and scent
<span id="line1726"></span>of the flower, and frequently also by honey which is secreted in some
<span id="line1727"></span>part of the flower. (For further details on the form and arrangement
<span id="line1728"></span>of the flower and its parts, see FLOWER.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1733"></span>which are associated to form the anther, and carried up on a stalk
<span id="line1734"></span>or filament. The development of the microsporangia and the contained
<span id="line1735"></span>spores (pollen-grains) is closely comparable with that of the
<span id="line1736"></span>microsporangia in Gymnosperms or heterosporous ferns. The pollen is
<span id="line1737"></span>set free by the opening (dehiscence) of the anther, generally by means
<span id="line1738"></span>of longitudinal slits, but sometimes by pores, as in the heath family
<span id="line1739"></span>(Ericaceae), or by valves, as in the barberry. It is then dropped

<span id="line1745"></span>the stigma is sometimes carried up on a style. The mature pollen-grain
<span id="line1746"></span>is, like other spores, a single cell; except in the case of some
<span id="line1747"></span>submerged aquatic plants, it has a double wall, a thin delicate wall
<span id="line1748"></span>of unaltered cellulose, the endospore or intine, and a tough outer

<span id="line1751"></span>is often of value for the distinction of genera or higher groups.
<span id="line1752"></span>Germination of the microspore begins before it leaves the pollen-sac.
<span id="line1753"></span>In very few cases has anything representing prothallial development
<span id="line1754"></span>been observed; generally a small cell (the antheridial or generative
<span id="line1755"></span>cell) is cut off, leaving a larger tube-cell. When placed on the
<span id="line1756"></span>stigma, under favourable circumstances, the pollen-grain puts forth a
<span id="line1757"></span>pollen-tube which grows down the tissue of the style to the ovary, and
<span id="line1758"></span>makes its way along the placenta, guided by projections or hairs,
<span id="line1759"></span>to the mouth of an ovule. The nucleus of the tube-cell has meanwhile
<span id="line1760"></span>passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus which
<span id="line1761"></span>divides to form two male- or sperm-cells. The male-cells are carried
<span id="line1762"></span>to their destination in the tip of the pollen-tube.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1767"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The ovary contains one or more ovules borne on a placenta, which is
<span id="line1768"></span>generally some part of the ovary-wall. The development of the ovule,
<span id="line1769"></span>which represents the macrosporangium, is very similar to the
<span id="line1770"></span>process in Gymnosperms; when mature it consists of one or two coats
<span id="line1771"></span>surrounding the central nucellus, except at the apex where an opening,
<span id="line1772"></span>the micropyle, is left. The nucellus is a cellular tissue enveloping
<span id="line1773"></span>one large cell, the embryo-sac or macrospore. The germination of the
<span id="line1774"></span>macrospore consists in the repeated division of its nucleus to form
<span id="line1775"></span>two groups of four, one group at each end of the embryo-sac. One
<span id="line1776"></span>nucleus from each group, the polar nucleus, passes to the centre of
<span id="line1777"></span>the sac, where the two fuse to form the so-called definitive nucleus.
<span id="line1778"></span>Of the three cells at the micropylar end of the sac, all naked cells
<span id="line1779"></span>(the so-called egg-apparatus), one is the egg-cell or oosphere, the
<span id="line1780"></span>other two, which may be regarded as representing abortive egg-cells
<span id="line1781"></span>(in rare cases capable of fertilization), are known as synergidae.
<span id="line1782"></span>The three cells at the opposite end are known as antipodal cells
<span id="line1783"></span>and become invested with a cell-wall. The gametophyte or prothallial
<span id="line1784"></span>generation is thus extremely reduced, consisting of but little more
<span id="line1785"></span>than the male and female sexual cells<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the two sperm-cells in the

<span id="line1790"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>At the period of fertilization the embryo-sac lies in close proximity
<span id="line1791"></span>to the opening of the micropyle, into which the pollen-tube has
<span id="line1792"></span>penetrated, the separating cell-wall becomes absorbed, and the male or
<span id="line1793"></span>sperm-cells are ejected into the embryo-sac. Guided by the synergidae
<span id="line1794"></span>one male-cell passes into the oosphere with which it fuses, the two
<span id="line1795"></span>nuclei uniting, while the other fuses with the definitive nucleus, or,
<span id="line1796"></span>as it is also called, the endosperm nucleus. This remarkable
<span id="line1797"></span>double fertilization as it has been called, although only recently
<span id="line1798"></span>discovered, has been proved to take place in widely-separated
<span id="line1799"></span>families, and both in Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, and there is
<span id="line1800"></span>every probability that, perhaps with variations, it is the normal
<span id="line1801"></span>process in Angiosperms. After impregnation the fertilized oosphere
<span id="line1802"></span>immediately surrounds itself with a cell-wall and becomes the oospore
<span id="line1803"></span>which by a process of growth forms the embryo of the new plant. The
<span id="line1804"></span>endosperm-nucleus divides rapidly to produce a cellular tissue which
<span id="line1805"></span>fills up the interior of the rapidly-growing embryo-sac, and forms a
<span id="line1806"></span>tissue, known as endosperm, in which is stored a supply of nourishment
<span id="line1807"></span>for the use later on of the embryo. It has long been known that after
<span id="line1808"></span>fertilization of the egg has taken place, the formation of endosperm
<span id="line1809"></span>begins from the endosperm nucleus, and this had come to be regarded as
<span id="line1810"></span>the recommencement of the development of a prothallium after a pause
<span id="line1811"></span>following the reinvigorating union of the polar nuclei. This view is
<span id="line1812"></span>still maintained by those who differentiate two acts of fertilization
<span id="line1813"></span>within the embryo-sac, and regard that of the egg by the first
<span id="line1814"></span>male-cell, as the true or generative fertilization, and that of the
<span id="line1815"></span>polar nuclei by the second male gamete as a vegetative fertilization
<span id="line1816"></span>which gives a stimulus to development in correlation with the other.
<span id="line1817"></span>If, on the other hand, the endosperm is the product of an act of
<span id="line1818"></span>fertilization as definite as that giving rise to the embryo itself,
<span id="line1819"></span>we have to recognize that twin-plants are produced within the
<span id="line1820"></span>embryo-sac<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>one, the embryo, which becomes the angiospermous plant,
<span id="line1821"></span>the other, the endosperm, a short-lived, undifferentiated nurse to
<span id="line1822"></span>assist in the nutrition of the former, even as the subsidiary embryos
<span id="line1823"></span>in a pluri-embryonic Gymnosperm may facilitate the nutrition of the
<span id="line1824"></span>dominant one. If this is so, and the endosperm like the embryo is
<span id="line1825"></span>normally the product of a sexual act, hybridization will give a hybrid
<span id="line1826"></span>endosperm as it does a hybrid embryo, and herein (it is suggested) we
<span id="line1827"></span>may have the explanation of the phenomenon of xenia observed in the
<span id="line1828"></span>mixed endosperms of hybrid races of maize and other plants, regarding
<span id="line1829"></span>which it has only been possible hitherto to assert that they were
<span id="line1830"></span>indications of the extension of the influence of the pollen beyond the
<span id="line1831"></span>egg and its product. This would not, however, explain the formation
<span id="line1832"></span>of fruits intermediate in size and colour between those of crossed
<span id="line1833"></span>parents. The signification of the coalescence of the polar nuclei is
<span id="line1834"></span>not explained by these new facts, but it is noteworthy that the second
<span id="line1835"></span>male-cell is said to unite sometimes with the apical polar nucleus,
<span id="line1836"></span>the sister of the egg, before the union of this with the basal polar
<span id="line1837"></span>one. The idea of the endosperm as a second subsidiary plant is no new
<span id="line1838"></span>one; it was suggested long ago in explanation of the coalescence of
<span id="line1839"></span>the polar nuclei, but it was then based on the assumption that these
<span id="line1840"></span>represented male and female cells, an assumption for which there
<span id="line1841"></span>was no evidence and which was inherently improbable. The proof of a
<span id="line1842"></span>coalescence of the second male nucleus with the definitive nucleus
<span id="line1843"></span>gives the conception a more stable basis. The antipodal cells aid more
<span id="line1844"></span>or less in the process of nutrition of the developing embryo, and may
<span id="line1845"></span>undergo multiplication, though they ultimately disintegrate, as do
<span id="line1846"></span>also the synergidae. As in Gymnosperms and other groups an interesting
<span id="line1847"></span>qualitative change is associated with the process of fertilization.
<span id="line1848"></span>The number of chromosomes (see PLANTS: </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cytology</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) in the nucleus
<span id="line1849"></span>of the two spores, pollen-grain and embryo-sac, is only half the
<span id="line1850"></span>number found in an ordinary vegetative nucleus; and this reduced
<span id="line1851"></span>number persists in the cells derived from them. The full number is
<span id="line1852"></span>restored in the fusion of the male and female nuclei in the process of
<span id="line1853"></span>fertilization, and remains until the formation of the cells from which
<span id="line1854"></span>the spores are derived in the new generation.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1856"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In several natural orders and genera departures from the course of

<span id="line1865"></span>of the ovule. Such a method of entrance is styled chalazogamic, in

<span id="line1870"></span>
<span id="line1871"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The result of fertilization is the development of the ovule into
<span id="line1872"></span>the seed. By the segmentation of the fertilized egg, now invested by
<span id="line1873"></span>cell-membrane, the embryo-plant arises. A varying number of transverse
<span id="line1874"></span>segment-walls transform it into a pro-embryo<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>a cellular row of which
<span id="line1875"></span>the cell nearest the micropyle becomes attached to the apex of the
<span id="line1876"></span>embryo-sac, and thus fixes the position of the developing embryo,
<span id="line1877"></span>while the terminal cell is projected into its cavity. In Dicotyledons
<span id="line1878"></span>the shoot of the embryo is wholly derived from the terminal cell of
<span id="line1879"></span>the pro-embryo, from the next cell the root arises, and the remaining
<span id="line1880"></span>ones form the suspensor. In many Monocotyledons the terminal cell
<span id="line1881"></span>forms the cotyledonary portion alone of the shoot of the embryo, its
<span id="line1882"></span>axial part and the root being derived from the adjacent cell; the
<span id="line1883"></span>cotyledon is thus a terminal structure and the apex of the primary
<span id="line1884"></span>stem a lateral one<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>a condition in marked contrast with that of the
<span id="line1885"></span>Dicotyledons. In some Monocotyledons,

The
<span id="line1887"></span>primary root of the embryo in all Angiosperms points towards the
<span id="line1888"></span>micropyle. The developing embryo at the end of the suspensor grows out
<span id="line1889"></span>to a varying extent into the forming endosperm, from which by surface
<span id="line1890"></span>absorption it derives good material for growth; at the same time the
<span id="line1891"></span>suspensor plays a direct part as a carrier of nutrition, and may even
<span id="line1892"></span>develop, where perhaps no endosperm is formed, special absorptive
<span id="line1893"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>suspensor roots<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> which invest the developing embryo, or pass out into
<span id="line1894"></span>the body and coats of the ovule, or even into the placenta. In some
<span id="line1895"></span>cases the embryo or the embryo-sac sends out suckers into the nucellus
<span id="line1896"></span>and ovular integument. As the embryo develops it may absorb all the
<span id="line1897"></span>food material available, and store, either in its cotyledons or in
<span id="line1898"></span>its hypocotyl, what is not immediately required for growth, as
<span id="line1899"></span>reserve-food for use in germination, and by so doing it increases
<span id="line1900"></span>in size until it may fill entirely the embryo-sac; or its absorptive
<span id="line1901"></span>power at this stage may be limited to what is necessary for growth and
<span id="line1902"></span>it remains of relatively small size, occupying but a small area of
<span id="line1903"></span>the embryo-sac, which is otherwise filled with endosperm in which
<span id="line1904"></span>the reserve-food is stored. There are also intermediate states. The
<span id="line1905"></span>position of the embryo in relation to the endosperm varies, sometimes
<span id="line1906"></span>it is internal, sometimes external, but the significance of this has
<span id="line1907"></span>not yet been established.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line1908"></span>
<span id="line1909"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The formation of endosperm starts, as has been stated, from the
<span id="line1910"></span>endosperm nucleus. Its segmentation always begins before that of the
<span id="line1911"></span>egg, and thus there is timely preparation for the nursing of the young
<span id="line1912"></span>embryo. If in its extension to contain the new formations within it
<span id="line1913"></span>the embryo-sac remains narrow, endosperm formation proceeds upon the
<span id="line1914"></span>lines of a cell-division, but in wide embryo-sacs the endosperm is
<span id="line1915"></span>first of all formed as a layer of naked cells around the wall of the
<span id="line1916"></span>sac, and only gradually acquires a pluricellular character, forming
<span id="line1917"></span>a tissue filling the sac. The function of the endosperm is primarily
<span id="line1918"></span>that of nourishing the embryo, and its basal position in the
<span id="line1919"></span>embryo-sac places it favourably for the absorption of food material
<span id="line1920"></span>entering the ovule. Its duration varies with the precocity of the
<span id="line1921"></span>embryo. It may be wholly absorbed by the progressive growth of the
<span id="line1922"></span>embryo within the embryo-sac, or it may persist as a definite and more
<span id="line1923"></span>or less conspicuous constituent of the seed. When it persists as
<span id="line1924"></span>a massive element of the seed its nutritive function is usually
<span id="line1925"></span>apparent, for there is accumulated within its cells reserve-food, and
<span id="line1926"></span>according to the dominant substance it is starchy, oily, or rich in
<span id="line1927"></span>cellulose, mucilage or proteid. In cases where the embryo has stored
<span id="line1928"></span>reserve food within itself and thus provided for self-nutrition, such
<span id="line1929"></span>endosperm as remains in the seed may take on other functions, for
<span id="line1930"></span>instance, that of water-absorption.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1932"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Some deviations from the usual course of development may be noted.
<span id="line1933"></span>Parthenogenesis, or the development of an embryo from an egg-cell

<span id="line1944"></span>polyembryony results from an adventitious production of embryos from
<span id="line1945"></span>the cells of the nucellus around the top of the embryo-sac. In a

<span id="line1949"></span>the embryo is developed from a cell of the endosperm, which is
<span id="line1950"></span>formed from the upper polar nucleus only, the egg apparatus
<span id="line1951"></span>becoming disorganized. The last-mentioned case has been regarded
<span id="line1952"></span>as representing an apogamous development of the sporophyte from the

<span id="line1954"></span>the great diversity of these abnormal cases as shown in the examples

<span id="line1961"></span>embryo-sac, its wall enlarges and commonly absorbs the substance of

<span id="line1964"></span>or the whole nucellus and even the integument may be absorbed. In some

<span id="line1972"></span>called </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>albuminous</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>endospermic</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, those in which neither
<span id="line1973"></span>is found are termed </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>exalbuminous</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>exendospermic</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. These
<span id="line1974"></span>terms, extensively used by systematists, only refer, however, to the
<span id="line1975"></span>grosser features of the seed, and indicate the more or less evident
<span id="line1976"></span>occurrence of a food-reserve; many so-called exalbuminous seeds show
<span id="line1977"></span>to microscopic examination a distinct endosperm which may have other
<span id="line1978"></span>than a nutritive function. The presence or absence of endosperm, its
<span id="line1979"></span>relative amount when present, and the position of the embryo within
<span id="line1980"></span>it, are valuable characters for the distinction of orders and groups
<span id="line1981"></span>of orders. Meanwhile the ovary wall has developed to form the fruit or
<span id="line1982"></span>pericarp, the structure of which is closely associated with the manner
<span id="line1983"></span>of distribution of the seed. Frequently the influence of fertilization
<span id="line1984"></span>is felt beyond the ovary, and other parts of the flower take part in
<span id="line1985"></span>the formation of the fruit, as the floral receptacle in the apple,
<span id="line1986"></span>strawberry and others. The character of the seed-coat bears a definite
<span id="line1987"></span>relation to that of the fruit. Their function is the twofold one of
<span id="line1988"></span>protecting the embryo and of aiding in dissemination; they may also
<span id="line1989"></span>directly promote germination. If the fruit is a dehiscent one and the
<span id="line1990"></span>seed is therefore soon exposed, the seed-coat has to provide for the
<span id="line1991"></span>protection of the embryo and may also have to secure dissemination. On
<span id="line1992"></span>the other hand, indehiscent fruits discharge these functions for the
<span id="line1993"></span>embryo, and the seed-coat is only slightly developed.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line1998"></span>animals<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>and fruits and seeds are therefore grouped in respect of this
<span id="line1999"></span>as hydrophilous, anemophilous and zooidiophilous. The needs for these
<span id="line2000"></span>are obvious<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>buoyancy in water and resistance to wetting for the
<span id="line2001"></span>first, some form of parachute for the second, and some attaching
<span id="line2002"></span>mechanism or attractive structure for the third. The methods in which
<span id="line2003"></span>these are provided are of infinite variety, and any and every part of
<span id="line2004"></span>the flower and of the inflorescence may be called into requisition to
<span id="line2005"></span>supply the adaptation (see FRUIT). Special outgrowths, arils, of the
<span id="line2006"></span>seed-coat are of frequent occurrence. In the feature of fruit and
<span id="line2007"></span>seed, by which the distribution of Angiosperms is effected, we have a
<span id="line2008"></span>distinctive character of the class. In Gymnosperms we have seeds,
<span id="line2009"></span>and the carpels may become modified and close around these, as in
<span id="line2010"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Pinus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, during the process of ripening to form an imitation of a
<span id="line2011"></span>box-like fruit which subsequently opening allows the seeds to escape;
<span id="line2012"></span>but there is never in them the closed ovary investing from the outset
<span id="line2013"></span>the ovules, and ultimately forming the ground-work of the fruit.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line2018"></span>suitable nidus for germination, the primary essential of which is a
<span id="line2019"></span>sufficiency of moisture, and the duration of vitality of the embryo is
<span id="line2020"></span>a point of interest. Some seeds retain vitality for a period of many
<span id="line2021"></span>years, though there is no warrant for the popular notion that genuine
<span id="line2022"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>mummy wheat<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> will germinate; on the other hand some seeds lose
<span id="line2023"></span>vitality in little more than a year. Further, the older the seed the
<span id="line2024"></span>more slow as a general rule will germination be in starting, but there
<span id="line2025"></span>are notable exceptions. This pause, often of so long duration, in
<span id="line2026"></span>the growth of the embryo between the time of its perfect development
<span id="line2027"></span>within the seed and the moment of germination, is one of the
<span id="line2028"></span>remarkable and distinctive features of the life of Spermatophytes. The
<span id="line2029"></span>aim of germination is the fixing of the embryo in the soil, effected
<span id="line2030"></span>usually by means of the root, which is the first part of the embryo
<span id="line2031"></span>to appear, in preparation for the elongation of the epicotyledonary
<span id="line2032"></span>portion of the shoot, and there is infinite variety in the details of
<span id="line2033"></span>the process. In albuminous Dicotyledons the cotyledons act as the
<span id="line2034"></span>absorbents of the reserve-food of the seed and are commonly brought
<span id="line2035"></span>above ground (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>epigeal</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), either withdrawn from the seed-coat or
<span id="line2036"></span>carrying it upon them, and then they serve as the first green
<span id="line2037"></span>organs of the plant. The part of the stem below the cotyledons
<span id="line2038"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>hypocotyl</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) commonly plays the greater part in bringing this
<span id="line2039"></span>about. Exalbuminous Dicotyledons usually store reserve-food in
<span id="line2040"></span>their cotyledons, which may in germination remain below ground
<span id="line2041"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>hypogeal</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>).

<span id="line2042"></span> albuminous Monocotyledons the cotyledon itself,
<span id="line2043"></span>probably in consequence of its terminal position, is commonly the
<span id="line2044"></span>agent by which the embryo is thrust out of the seed, and it may
<span id="line2045"></span>function solely as a feeder, its extremity developing as a sucker
<span id="line2046"></span>through which the endosperm is absorbed, or it may become the first
<span id="line2047"></span>green organ, the terminal sucker dropping off with the seed-coat when
<span id="line2048"></span>the endosperm is exhausted. Exalbuminous Monocotyledons are either
<span id="line2049"></span>hydrophytes or strongly hygrophilous plants and have often peculiar
<span id="line2050"></span>features in germination.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line2055"></span>Angiosperms that distribution by vegetative buds is only an occasional
<span id="line2056"></span>process. At the same time every bud on a shoot has the capacity
<span id="line2057"></span>to form a new plant if placed in suitable conditions, as the
<span id="line2058"></span>horticultural practice of propagation by cuttings shows; in nature we
<span id="line2059"></span>see plants spreading by the rooting of their shoots, and buds we know
<span id="line2060"></span>may be freely formed not only on stems but on leaves and on roots.
<span id="line2061"></span>Where detachable buds are produced, which can be transported through
<span id="line2062"></span>the air to a distance, each of them is an incipient shoot which may
<span id="line2063"></span>have a root, and there is always reserve-food stored in some part of
<span id="line2064"></span>it. In essentials such a bud resembles a seed. A relation between
<span id="line2065"></span>such vegetative distribution buds and production of flower is usually
<span id="line2066"></span>marked. Where there is free formation of buds there is little flower
<span id="line2067"></span>and commonly no seed, and the converse is also the case. Viviparous
<span id="line2068"></span>plants are an illustration of substitution of vegetative buds for

<span id="line2076"></span>evolution, we can as yet say little.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2077"></span>
<span id="line2078"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Until well on in the Mesozoic period geological history tells us
<span id="line2079"></span>nothing about Angiosperms, and then only by their vegetative organs.
<span id="line2080"></span>We readily recognize in them now-a-days the natural classes of
<span id="line2081"></span>Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons distinguished alike in vegetative
<span id="line2082"></span>and in reproductive construction, yet showing remarkable parallel
<span id="line2083"></span>sequences in development; and we see that the Dicotyledons are the
<span id="line2084"></span>more advanced and show the greater capacity for further progressive
<span id="line2085"></span>evolution. But there is no sound basis for the assumption that
<span id="line2086"></span>the Dicotyledons are derived from Monocotyledons; indeed, the
<span id="line2087"></span>palaeontological evidence seems to point to the Dicotyledons being
<span id="line2088"></span>the older. This, however, does not entitle us to assume the origin
<span id="line2089"></span>of Monocotyledons from Dicotyledons, although there is manifestly a
<span id="line2090"></span>temptation to connect helobic forms of the former with ranal ones of
<span id="line2091"></span>the latter. There is no doubt that the phylum of Angiosperms has not
<span id="line2092"></span>sprung from that of Gymnosperms.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2093"></span>
<span id="line2094"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Within each class the flower-characters as the essential feature
<span id="line2095"></span>of Angiosperms supply the clue to phylogeny, but the uncertainty
<span id="line2096"></span>regarding the construction of the primitive angiospermous flower gives
<span id="line2097"></span>a fundamental point of divergence in attempts to construct progressive
<span id="line2098"></span>sequences of the families. Simplicity of flower-structure has appeared
<span id="line2099"></span>to some to be always primitive, whilst by others it has been taken to
<span id="line2100"></span>be always derived. There is, however, abundant evidence that it may
<span id="line2101"></span>have the one or the other character in different cases. Apart from
<span id="line2102"></span>this, botanists are generally agreed that the concrescence of parts of
<span id="line2103"></span>the flower-whorls<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>in the gynaeceum as the seed-covering, and in the
<span id="line2104"></span>corolla as the seat of attraction, more than in the androecium and the
<span id="line2105"></span>calyx<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>is an indication of advance, as is also the concrescence
<span id="line2106"></span>that gives the condition of epigyny. Dorsiventrality is also clearly
<span id="line2107"></span>derived from radial construction, and anatropy of the ovule has
<span id="line2108"></span>followed atropy. We should expect the albuminous state of the seed
<span id="line2109"></span>to be an antecedent one to the exalbuminous condition, and the recent
<span id="line2110"></span>discoveries in fertilization tend to confirm this view. Amongst
<span id="line2111"></span>Dicotyledons the gamopetalous forms are admitted to be the highest
<span id="line2112"></span>development and a dominant one of our epoch. Advance has been along
<span id="line2113"></span>two lines, markedly in relation to insect-pollination, one of which
<span id="line2114"></span>has culminated in the hypogynous epipetalous bicarpellate forms with
<span id="line2115"></span>dorsiventral often large and loosely arranged flowers such as occur
<span id="line2116"></span>in Scrophulariaceae, and the other in the epigynous bicarpellate
<span id="line2117"></span>small-flowered families of which the Compositae represent the most
<span id="line2118"></span>elaborate type. In the polypetalous forms progression from hypogyny
<span id="line2119"></span>to epigyny is generally recognized, and where dorsiventrality with
<span id="line2120"></span>insect-pollination has been established, a dominant group has been
<span id="line2121"></span>developed as in the Leguminosae. The starting-point of the class,
<span id="line2122"></span>however, and the position within it of apetalous families with
<span id="line2123"></span>frequently unisexual flowers, have provoked much discussion. In
<span id="line2124"></span>Monocotyledons a similar advance from hypogyny to epigyny is observed,
<span id="line2125"></span>and from the dorsiventral to the radial type of flower. In this
<span id="line2126"></span>connexion it is noteworthy that so many of the higher forms are
<span id="line2127"></span>adapted as bulbous geophytes, or as aerophytes to special xerophilous
<span id="line2128"></span>conditions. The Gramineae offer a prominent example of a dominant
<span id="line2129"></span>self-pollinated or wind-pollinated family, and this may find
<span id="line2130"></span>explanation in a multiplicity of factors.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2131"></span>
<span id="line2132"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Though best known for his artificial (or sexual) system, Linnaeus
<span id="line2133"></span>was impressed with the importance of elaborating a natural system of
<span id="line2134"></span>arrangement in which plants should be arranged according to their true
<span id="line2135"></span>affinities. In his </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Philosophia Botanica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1751) Linnaeus grouped
<span id="line2136"></span>the genera then known into sixty-seven orders (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>fragmenta</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), all
<span id="line2137"></span>except five of which are Angiosperms. He gave names to these but did
<span id="line2138"></span>not characterize them or attempt to arrange them in larger groups.
<span id="line2139"></span>Some represent natural groups and had in several cases been already
<span id="line2140"></span>recognized by Ray and others, but the majority are, in the light
<span id="line2141"></span>of modern knowledge, very mixed. Well-defined polypetalous and
<span id="line2142"></span>gamopetalous genera sometimes occur in the same order, and even
<span id="line2143"></span>Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons are classed together where they have
<span id="line2144"></span>some striking physiological character in common.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2145"></span>
<span id="line2146"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Work on the lines suggested by the Linnaean </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>fragmenta</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> was
<span id="line2147"></span>continued in France by Bernard de Jussieu and his nephew, Antoine
<span id="line2148"></span>Laurent, and the arrangement suggested by the latter in his </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Genera
<span id="line2149"></span>Plantarum secundum Ordines Naturales disposita</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1789) is the
<span id="line2150"></span>first which can claim to be a natural system. The orders are carefully
<span id="line2151"></span>characterized, and those of Angiosperms are grouped in fourteen
<span id="line2152"></span>classes under the two main divisions Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons.
<span id="line2153"></span>The former comprise three classes, which are distinguished by the
<span id="line2154"></span>relative position of the stamens and ovary; the eleven classes of
<span id="line2155"></span>the latter are based on the same set of characters and fall into
<span id="line2156"></span>the larger subdivisions Apetalae, Monopetalae and Polypetalae,
<span id="line2157"></span>characterized respectively by absence, union or freedom of the petals,
<span id="line2158"></span>and a subdivision, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Diclines Irregulares</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, a very unnatural
<span id="line2159"></span>group, including one class only. A. P. de Candolle introduced several
<span id="line2160"></span>improvements into the system. In his arrangement the last subdivision
<span id="line2161"></span>disappears, and the Dicotyledons fall into two groups, a larger
<span id="line2162"></span>containing those in which both calyx and corolla are present in the
<span id="line2163"></span>flower, and a smaller, Monochlamydeae, representing the Apetalae and
<span id="line2164"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Diclines Irregulares</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Jussieu. The dichlamydeous group is
<span id="line2165"></span>subdivided into three, Thalamiflorae, Calyciflorae and Corolliflorae,
<span id="line2166"></span>depending on the position and union of the petals. This, which we may

<span id="line2222"></span>undoubtedly represents a progression from simpler to more elaborate
<span id="line2223"></span>forms, but a great drawback to the value of the system is the
<span id="line2224"></span>inclusion among the Monochlamydeae of a number of orders which are
<span id="line2225"></span>closely allied with orders of Polypetalae though differing in absence
<span id="line2226"></span>of a corolla. The German systematist, A. W. Eichler, attempted
<span id="line2227"></span>to remove this disadvantage which since the time of Jussieu had
<span id="line2228"></span>characterized the French system, and in 1883 grouped the Dicotyledons
<span id="line2229"></span>in two subclasses. The earlier Choripetalae embraces the Polypetalae
<span id="line2230"></span>and Monochlamydae of the French systems. It includes 21 series, and
<span id="line2231"></span>is an attempt to arrange as far as possible in a linear series those
<span id="line2232"></span>orders which are characterized by absence or freedom of petals. The
<span id="line2233"></span>second subclass, Gamopetalae, includes 9 series and culminates
<span id="line2234"></span>in those which show the most elaborate type of flower, the series
<span id="line2235"></span>Aggregatae, the chief representative of which is the great and
<span id="line2236"></span>wide-spread order Compositae. A modification of Eichler's system,
<span id="line2237"></span>embracing the most recent views of the affinities of the orders of
<span id="line2238"></span>Angiosperms, has been put forward by Dr. Adolf Engler of Berlin, who
<span id="line2239"></span>adopts the suggestive names Archichlamydeae and Metachlamydeae for the
<span id="line2240"></span>two subdivisions of Dicotyledons. Dr. Engler is the principal editor

<span id="line2259"></span>
<span id="line2260"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The most remarkable feature here is the class of Liorhizal
<span id="line2261"></span>Dicotyledons, which includes only the families of Nymphaeaceae
<span id="line2262"></span>and Gramineae. It is based upon the fact that the histological
<span id="line2263"></span>differentiation of the epidermis of their root is that generally
<span id="line2264"></span>characteristic of Monocotyledons, whilst they have two cotyledons<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the
<span id="line2265"></span>old view of the epiblast as a second cotyledon in Gramineae being
<span id="line2266"></span>adopted. But the presence of a second cotyledon in grasses is
<span id="line2267"></span>extremely doubtful, and though there may be ground for reconsidering
<span id="line2268"></span>the position of Nymphaeaceae, their association with the grasses as
<span id="line2269"></span>a distinct class is not warranted by a comparative examination of the
<span id="line2270"></span>members of the two orders. Ovular characters determine the grouping in
<span id="line2271"></span>the Dicotyledons, van Tieghem supporting the view that the integument,
<span id="line2272"></span>the outer if there be two, is the lamina of a leaf of which the
<span id="line2273"></span>funicle is the petiole, whilst the nucellus is an outgrowth of
<span id="line2274"></span>this leaf, and the inner integument, if present, an indusium. The
<span id="line2275"></span>Insemineae include forms in which the nucellus is not developed, and
<span id="line2276"></span>therefore there can be no seed. The plants included are, however,
<span id="line2277"></span>mainly well-established parasites, and the absence of nucellus is only
<span id="line2278"></span>one of those characters of reduction to which parasites are liable.
<span id="line2279"></span>Even if we admit van Tieghem's interpretation of the integuments to
<span id="line2280"></span>be correct, the diagnostic mark of his unitegminous and bitegminous
<span id="line2281"></span>groups is simply that of the absence or presence of an indusium, not a
<span id="line2282"></span>character of great value elsewhere, and, as we know, the number of the
<span id="line2283"></span>ovular coats is inconstant within the same family. At the same time
<span id="line2284"></span>the groups based upon the integuments are of much the same extent as
<span id="line2285"></span>the Polypetalae and Gamopetalae of other systems. We do not yet
<span id="line2286"></span>know the significance of this correlation, which, however, is not an
<span id="line2287"></span>invariable one, between number of integuments and union of petals.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line2343"></span>less than a mile to the south of the royal city, within a rectangular
<span id="line2344"></span>park surrounded by a moat, the outer perimeter of which measures 6060
<span id="line2345"></span>yds. On the west side of the park a paved causeway, leading over the
<span id="line2346"></span>moat and under a magnificent portico, extends for a distance of a
<span id="line2347"></span>quarter of a mile to the chief entrance of the main building. The
<span id="line2348"></span>temple was originally devoted to the worship of Brahma, but afterwards
<span id="line2349"></span>to that of Buddha; its construction is assigned by Aymonier to the
<span id="line2350"></span>first half of the 12th century A.D. It consists of three stages,
<span id="line2351"></span>connected by numerous exterior staircases and decreasing in dimensions
<span id="line2352"></span>as they rise, culminating in the sanctuary, a great central tower
<span id="line2353"></span>pyramidal in form. Towers also surmount the angles of the terraces
<span id="line2354"></span>of the two upper stages. Three galleries with vaulting supported on
<span id="line2355"></span>columns lead from the three western portals to the second stage.
<span id="line2356"></span>They are connected by a transverse gallery, thus forming four square
<span id="line2357"></span>basins. Khmer decoration, profuse but harmonious, consists chiefly in
<span id="line2358"></span>the representation of gods, men and animals, which are displayed on
<span id="line2359"></span>every flat surface. Combats and legendary episodes are often depicted;
<span id="line2360"></span>floral decoration is reserved chiefly for borders, mouldings and
<span id="line2361"></span>capitals. Sandstone of various colours was the chief material employed
<span id="line2362"></span>by the Khmers; limonite was also used. The stone was cut into huge

<span id="line2381"></span>one line or plane to another. Euclid (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Elements</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, book I) defines
<span id="line2382"></span>a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two
<span id="line2383"></span>lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to
<span id="line2384"></span>each other (see GEOMETRY, EUCLIDEAN). According to Proclus an angle
<span id="line2385"></span>must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first
<span id="line2386"></span>concept was utilized by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation
<span id="line2387"></span>from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded
<span id="line2388"></span>it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid
<span id="line2389"></span>adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute,
<span id="line2390"></span>and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative. A discussion of

<span id="line2393"></span>of Euclid's Elements</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1905). Following Euclid, a right angle is
<span id="line2394"></span>formed by a straight line standing upon another straight line so as to
<span id="line2395"></span>make the adjacent angles equal; any angle less than a right angle is
<span id="line2396"></span>termed an acute angle, and any angle greater than a right angle an
<span id="line2397"></span>obtuse angle. The difference between an acute angle and a right angle
<span id="line2398"></span>is termed the complement of the angle, and between an angle and two
<span id="line2399"></span>right angles the supplement of the angle. The generalized view of
<span id="line2400"></span>angles and their measurement is treated in the article TRIGONOMETRY.
<span id="line2401"></span>A solid angle is definable as the space contained by three or more
<span id="line2402"></span>planes intersecting in a common point; it is familiarly represented
<span id="line2403"></span>by a corner. The angle between two planes is termed dihedral, between
<span id="line2404"></span>three trihedral, between any number more than three polyhedral.
<span id="line2405"></span>A spherical angle is a particular dihedral angle; it is the angle
<span id="line2406"></span>between two intersecting arcs on a sphere, and is measured by the
<span id="line2407"></span>angle between the planes containing the arcs and the centre of the
<span id="line2408"></span>sphere.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line2430"></span>Great Britain and Europe generally, the grotesque shape of its body
<span id="line2431"></span>and its singular habits having attracted the attention of naturalists
<span id="line2432"></span>of all ages. To the North Sea fishermen this fish is known as the
<span id="line2433"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>monk,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> a name which more properly belongs to </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Rhina squatina</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>,
<span id="line2434"></span>a fish allied to the skates. Its head is of enormous size, broad,
<span id="line2435"></span>flat and depressed, the remainder of the body appearing merely like an
<span id="line2436"></span>appendage. The wide mouth extends all round the anterior circumference
<span id="line2437"></span>of the head; and both jaws are armed with bands of long pointed teeth,
<span id="line2438"></span>which are inclined inwards, and can be depressed so as to offer no
<span id="line2439"></span>impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent
<span id="line2440"></span>its escape from the mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so
<span id="line2441"></span>articulated as to perform the functions of feet, the fish being
<span id="line2442"></span>enabled to move, or rather to walk, on the bottom of the sea, where it
<span id="line2443"></span>generally hides itself in the sand or amongst sea-weed. All round
<span id="line2444"></span>its head and also along the body the skin bears fringed appendages
<span id="line2445"></span>resembling short fronds of sea-weed, a structure which, combined with
<span id="line2446"></span>the extraordinary faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to
<span id="line2447"></span>its surroundings, assists this fish greatly in concealing itself in
<span id="line2448"></span>places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. To render
<span id="line2449"></span>the organization of this creature perfect in relation to its wants, it
<span id="line2450"></span>is provided with three long filaments inserted along the middle of the
<span id="line2451"></span>head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines
<span id="line2452"></span>of the anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important in the economy
<span id="line2453"></span>of the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a
<span id="line2454"></span>lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to
<span id="line2455"></span>attract other fishes by means of its lure, and then to seize them
<span id="line2456"></span>with its enormous jaws. It is probable enough that smaller fishes are
<span id="line2457"></span>attracted in this way, but experiments have shown that the action
<span id="line2458"></span>of the jaws is automatic and depends on contact of the prey with the
<span id="line2459"></span>tentacle. Its stomach is distensible in an extraordinary degree, and
<span id="line2460"></span>not rarely fishes have been taken out quite as large and heavy as
<span id="line2461"></span>their destroyer. It grows to a length of more than 5 ft.; specimens
<span id="line2462"></span>of 3 ft. are common. The spawn of the angler is very remarkable. It
<span id="line2463"></span>consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material 2 or 3
<span id="line2464"></span>ft. broad and 25 to 30 ft. in length. The eggs in this sheet are in a
<span id="line2465"></span>single layer, each in its own little cavity. The spawn is free in the
<span id="line2466"></span>sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins elongated
<span id="line2467"></span>into filaments. The British species is found all round the coasts of
<span id="line2468"></span>Europe and western North America, but becomes scarce beyond 60<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> N.
<span id="line2469"></span>lat.; it occurs also on the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope. A second

<span id="line2479"></span>Pembrokeshire, was born at Dublin on the 10th of July 1614, was
<span id="line2480"></span>educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and was admitted to Lincoln's
<span id="line2481"></span>Inn in 1634. Having made the grand tour he returned to Ireland; and
<span id="line2482"></span>being employed by the parliament in a mission to the duke of Ormonde,
<span id="line2483"></span>now reduced to the last extremities, he succeeded in concluding a
<span id="line2484"></span>treaty with him on the 19th of June 1647, thus securing the country
<span id="line2485"></span>from complete subjection to the rebels. In April 1647 he was
<span id="line2486"></span>returned for Radnorshire to the House of Commons. He supported the
<span id="line2487"></span>parliamentary as against the republican or army party, and appears
<span id="line2488"></span>to have been one of the members excluded in 1648. He sat in Richard
<span id="line2489"></span>Cromwell's parliament for Dublin city, and endeavoured to take his
<span id="line2490"></span>seat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659. He was made president of
<span id="line2491"></span>the council in February 1660, and in the Convention Parliament sat for
<span id="line2492"></span>Carmarthen borough. The anarchy of the last months of the commonwealth
<span id="line2493"></span>converted him to royalism, and he showed great activity in bringing
<span id="line2494"></span>about the Restoration. He used his influence in moderating measures of
<span id="line2495"></span>revenge and violence, and while sitting in judgment on the regicides
<span id="line2496"></span>was on the side of leniency. In November 1660 by his father's death
<span id="line2497"></span>he had become Viscount Valentia and Baron Mountnorris in the Irish
<span id="line2498"></span>peerage, and on the 20th April 1661 he was created Baron Annesley of
<span id="line2499"></span>Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire and earl of Anglesey in the
<span id="line2500"></span>peerage of Great Britain. He supported the king's administration in
<span id="line2501"></span>parliament, but opposed strongly the unjust measure which, on the
<span id="line2502"></span>abolition of the court of wards, placed the extra burden of
<span id="line2503"></span>taxation thus rendered necessary on the excise. His services in the
<span id="line2504"></span>administration of Ireland were especially valuable. He filled the
<span id="line2505"></span>office of vice-treasurer from 1660 till 1667, served on the committee
<span id="line2506"></span>for carrying out the declaration for the settlement of Ireland and on
<span id="line2507"></span>the committee for Irish affairs, while later, in 1671 and 1672, he was
<span id="line2508"></span>a leading member of various commissions appointed to investigate the
<span id="line2509"></span>working of the Acts of Settlement. In February 1661 he had obtained a
<span id="line2510"></span>captaincy of horse, and in 1667 he exchanged his vice-treasuryship of
<span id="line2511"></span>Ireland for the treasuryship of the navy. His public career was marked
<span id="line2512"></span>by great independence and fidelity to principle. On the 24th of July

<span id="line2548"></span>well as for Langhorne and Plunket. His independent attitude drew
<span id="line2549"></span>upon him an attack by Dangerfield, and in the Commons by the
<span id="line2550"></span>attorney-general, Sir W. Jones, who accused him of endeavouring to
<span id="line2551"></span>stifle the evidence against the Romanists. In March 1679 he protested
<span id="line2552"></span>against the second reading of the bill for disabling Danby. In 1681

<span id="line2555"></span>on the Irish rebellion defending the action of the Irish and the Roman
<span id="line2556"></span>Catholics. In so doing Anglesey was held by Ormonde to have censured
<span id="line2557"></span>his conduct and that of Charles I. in concluding the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Cessation,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line2558"></span>and the duke brought the matter before the council. In 1682 he wrote

<span id="line2646"></span>field-marshal, was born on the 17th of May 1768. He was the eldest son
<span id="line2647"></span>of Henry Paget, 1st earl of Uxbridge (d. 1812), and was educated at
<span id="line2648"></span>Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, afterwards entering
<span id="line2649"></span>parliament in 1790 as member for Carnarvon, for which he sat for six
<span id="line2650"></span>years. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary wars Lord Paget (as
<span id="line2651"></span>he was then styled), who had already served in the militia, raised on
<span id="line2652"></span>his father's estate the regiment of Staffordshire volunteers, in which
<span id="line2653"></span>he was given the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel (1793). The
<span id="line2654"></span>corps soon became part of the regular army as the 80th Foot, and it
<span id="line2655"></span>took part, under Lord Paget's command, in the Flanders campaign of
<span id="line2656"></span>1794. In spite of his youth he held a brigade command for a time, and
<span id="line2657"></span>gained also, during the campaign, his first experience of the cavalry
<span id="line2658"></span>arm, with which he was thenceforward associated. His substantive
<span id="line2659"></span>commission as lieutenant-colonel of the 16th Light Dragoons bore the
<span id="line2660"></span>date of the 15th of June 1795, and in 1796 he was made a colonel
<span id="line2661"></span>in the army. In 1795 he married Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers,
<span id="line2662"></span>daughter of the earl of Jersey. In April 1797 Lord Paget was
<span id="line2663"></span>transferred to a lieut.-colonelcy in the 7th Light Dragoons, of which
<span id="line2664"></span>regiment he became colonel in 1801. From the first he applied himself
<span id="line2665"></span>strenuously to the improvement of discipline, and to the perfection of
<span id="line2666"></span>a new system of cavalry evolutions. In the short campaign of 1799
<span id="line2667"></span>in Holland, Paget commanded the cavalry brigade, and in spite of the
<span id="line2668"></span>unsuitable character of the ground, he made, on several occasions,
<span id="line2669"></span>brilliant and successful charges. After the return of the expedition,
<span id="line2670"></span>he devoted himself zealously to his regiment, which under his command
<span id="line2671"></span>became one of the best corps in the service. In 1802 he was promoted
<span id="line2672"></span>major-general, and six years later lieutenant-general. In command of
<span id="line2673"></span>the cavalry of Sir John Moore's army during the Corunna campaign, Lord
<span id="line2674"></span>Paget won the greatest distinction. At Sahagun, Mayorga and Benavente,
<span id="line2675"></span>the British cavalry behaved so well under his leadership that Moore
<span id="line2676"></span>wrote:<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>It is impossible for me to say too much in its praise.... Our

<span id="line2680"></span>example and instruction of their ... leaders....<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> At Benavente one
<span id="line2681"></span>of Napoleon's best cavalry leaders, General Lefebvre Desno<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>euml;</span>ttes, was
<span id="line2682"></span>taken prisoner. Corunna was Paget's last service in the Peninsula.
<span id="line2683"></span>His </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>liaison</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> with the wife of Henry Wellesley, afterwards
<span id="line2684"></span>Lord Cowley, made it impossible at that time for him to serve with
<span id="line2685"></span>Wellington, whose cavalry, on many occasions during the succeeding
<span id="line2686"></span>campaigns, felt the want of the true cavalry leader to direct them.
<span id="line2687"></span>His only war service from 1809 to 1815 was in the disastrous Walcheren
<span id="line2688"></span>expedition (1809) in which he commanded a division. During these
<span id="line2689"></span>years he occupied himself with his parliamentary duties as member
<span id="line2690"></span>for Milborne Port, which he represented almost continuously up to his
<span id="line2691"></span>father's death in 1812, when he took his seat in the House of Lords as
<span id="line2692"></span>earl of Uxbridge. In 1810 he was divorced and married Mrs Wellesley,
<span id="line2693"></span>who had about the same time been divorced from her husband. Lady
<span id="line2694"></span>Paget was soon afterwards married to the duke of Argyll. In 1815 Lord
<span id="line2695"></span>Uxbridge received command of the British cavalry in Flanders. At a
<span id="line2696"></span>moment of danger such as that of Napoleon's return from Elba, the
<span id="line2697"></span>services of the best cavalry general in the British army could not be
<span id="line2698"></span>neglected. Wellington placed the greatest confidence in him, and on
<span id="line2699"></span>the eve of Waterloo extended his command so as to include the whole of
<span id="line2700"></span>the allied cavalry and horse artillery. He covered the retirement of
<span id="line2701"></span>the allies from Quatre Bras to Waterloo on the 17th of June, and on
<span id="line2702"></span>the 18th gained the crowning distinction of his military career in
<span id="line2703"></span>leading the great cavalry charge of the British centre, which checked
<span id="line2704"></span>and in part routed D'Erlon's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>corps d'arm<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>e</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (see WATERLOO
<span id="line2705"></span>CAMPAIGN). Freely exposing his own life throughout, the earl received,
<span id="line2706"></span>by one of the last cannon shots fired, a severe wound in the leg,
<span id="line2707"></span>necessitating amputation. Five days later the prince regent created
<span id="line2708"></span>him marquess of Anglesey in recognition of his brilliant services,
<span id="line2709"></span>which were regarded universally as second only to those of the duke
<span id="line2710"></span>himself. He was made a G. C. B. and he was also decorated by many of the
<span id="line2711"></span>allied sovereigns.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2712"></span>
<span id="line2713"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In 1818 the marquess was made a knight of the Garter, in 1819 he
<span id="line2714"></span>became full general, and at the coronation of George IV. he acted as
<span id="line2715"></span>lord high steward of England. His support of the proceedings against
<span id="line2716"></span>Queen Caroline made him for a time unpopular, and when he was on one
<span id="line2717"></span>occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>The Queen,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line2718"></span>he added the wish, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>May all your wives be like her.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> At the close of
<span id="line2719"></span>April 1827 he became a member of the Canning administration, taking
<span id="line2720"></span>the post of master-general of the ordnance, previously held by
<span id="line2721"></span>Wellington. He was at the same time sworn a member of the privy
<span id="line2722"></span>council. Under the Wellington administration he accepted the
<span id="line2723"></span>appointment of lord-lieutenant of Ireland (March 1828), and in the
<span id="line2724"></span>discharge of his important duties he greatly endeared himself to
<span id="line2725"></span>the Irish people. The spirit in which he acted and the aims which
<span id="line2726"></span>he steadily set before himself contributed to the allaying of party
<span id="line2727"></span>animosities, to the promotion of a willing submission to the laws,
<span id="line2728"></span>to the prosperity of trade and to the extension and improvement of
<span id="line2729"></span>education. On the great question of the time his views were opposed
<span id="line2730"></span>to those of the government. He saw clearly that the time was come when
<span id="line2731"></span>the relief of the Catholics from the penal legislation of the past was
<span id="line2732"></span>an indispensable measure, and in December 1828 he addressed a letter
<span id="line2733"></span>to the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland distinctly announcing his
<span id="line2734"></span>view. This led to his recall by the government, a step sincerely
<span id="line2735"></span>lamented by the Irish. He pleaded for Catholic emancipation in
<span id="line2736"></span>parliament, and on the formation of Earl Grey's administration in
<span id="line2737"></span>November 1830, he again became lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The times
<span id="line2738"></span>were changed; the act of emancipation had been passed, and the task of
<span id="line2739"></span>viceroy in his second tenure of office was to resist the agitation for
<span id="line2740"></span>repeal of the union carried on by O'Connell. He felt it his duty now
<span id="line2741"></span>to demand Coercion Acts for the security of the public peace; his
<span id="line2742"></span>popularity was diminished, differences appeared in the cabinet on
<span id="line2743"></span>the difficult subject, and in July 1833 the ministry resigned. To the
<span id="line2744"></span>marquess of Anglesey Ireland is indebted for the board of education,
<span id="line2745"></span>the origination of which may perhaps be reckoned as the most memorable
<span id="line2746"></span>act of his viceroyalty. For thirteen years after his retirement
<span id="line2747"></span>he remained out of office, and took little part in the affairs of
<span id="line2748"></span>government. He joined the Russell administration in July 1846 as
<span id="line2749"></span>master-general of the ordnance, finally retiring with his chief in
<span id="line2750"></span>March 1852. His promotion in the army was completed by his advancement
<span id="line2751"></span>to the rank of field-marshal in 1846. Four years before, he exchanged
<span id="line2752"></span>his colonelcy of the 7th Light Dragoons which he had held over forty
<span id="line2753"></span>years, for that of the Royal Horse Guards. He died on the 29th of
<span id="line2754"></span>April 1854.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line2789"></span>Cors cerrig y daran, but rising water is generally scarce. The climate
<span id="line2790"></span>is humid, the land poor for the most part compared with its old state

<span id="line2793"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>As regards geology, the younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a
<span id="line2794"></span>foundation of very old pre-Cambrian rocks which appear at the
<span id="line2795"></span>surface in three areas:<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>(1) a western region including Holyhead and
<span id="line2796"></span>Llanfaethlu, (2) a central area about Aberffraw and Trefdraeth,
<span id="line2797"></span>and (3) an eastern region which includes Newborough, Caerwen and
<span id="line2798"></span>Pentraeth. These pre-Cambrian rocks are schists and slates, often much
<span id="line2799"></span>contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations
<span id="line2800"></span>in the island is from N.E. to S.W. A belt of granitic rocks lies
<span id="line2801"></span>immediately north-west of the central pre-Cambrian mass, reaching from
<span id="line2802"></span>Llanfaelog near the coast to the vicinity of Llanerchymedd. Between
<span id="line2803"></span>this granite and the pre-Cambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of
<span id="line2804"></span>Ordovician slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this
<span id="line2805"></span>tract spreads out in the N. of the island between Dulas Bay and Carmel
<span id="line2806"></span>Point. A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of
<span id="line2807"></span>Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed
<span id="line2808"></span>and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered
<span id="line2809"></span>volcanic rocks which are probably pre-Cambrian. Between the eastern
<span id="line2810"></span>and central pre-Cambrian masses carboniferous rocks are found. The
<span id="line2811"></span>carboniferous limestone occupies a broad area S. of Ligwy Bay and
<span id="line2812"></span>Pentraeth, and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by
<span id="line2813"></span>Llangefni to Malldraeth sands. The limestone is underlain on the
<span id="line2814"></span>N.W. by a red basement conglomerate and yellow sandstone (sometimes
<span id="line2815"></span>considered to be of Old Red Sandstone age). Limestone occurs again on
<span id="line2816"></span>the N. coast about Llanfihangel and Llangoed; and in the S.W. round
<span id="line2817"></span>Llanidan on the border of the Menai Strait. Puffin Island is made
<span id="line2818"></span>of carboniferous limestone. Malldraeth Marsh is occupied by coal
<span id="line2819"></span>measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near
<span id="line2820"></span>Tall-y-foel Ferry on the Menai Straits. A patch of granitic and
<span id="line2821"></span>felsitic rocks form Parys Mountain, where copper and iron

<span id="line2825"></span>There are abundant evidences of glaciation, and much boulder clay and

<span id="line2831"></span>(Caer Gybi), also from Gaerwen to Amlwch. The staple of the island is
<span id="line2832"></span>farming, the chief crops being turnips, oats, potatoes, with flax in

<span id="line2873"></span>in Anglesey; the name anglesite, from this locality, was given by F. S.
<span id="line2874"></span>Beudant in 1832. The crystals from Anglesey, which were formerly found
<span id="line2875"></span>abundantly on a matrix of dull limonite, are small in size and simple
<span id="line2876"></span>in form, being usually bounded by four faces of a prism and four faces
<span id="line2877"></span>of a dome; they are brownish-yellow in colour owing to a stain of
<span id="line2878"></span>limonite. Crystals from some other localities, notably from Monteponi
<span id="line2879"></span>in Sardinia, are transparent and colourless, possessed of a brilliant
<span id="line2880"></span>adamantine lustre, and usually modified by numerous bright faces. The
<span id="line2881"></span>variety of combinations and habits presented by the crystals is very
<span id="line2882"></span>extensive, nearly two hundred distinct forms being figured by V.

<span id="line2897"></span>encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills,

<span id="line2909"></span>precise indication of their geographical position, but states that,
<span id="line2910"></span>together with six other tribes, including the Varini (the Warni of
<span id="line2911"></span>later times), they worshipped a goddess named Nerthus, whose
<span id="line2912"></span>sanctuary was situated on <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>an island in the Ocean.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> Ptolemy in his

<span id="line2914"></span>with more precision between the Rhine, or rather perhaps the Ems,
<span id="line2915"></span>and the Elbe, and speaks of them as one of the chief tribes of the
<span id="line2916"></span>interior. Unfortunately, however, it is clear from a comparison of
<span id="line2917"></span>his map with the evidence furnished by Tacitus and other Roman writers
<span id="line2918"></span>that the indications which he gives cannot be correct. Owing to
<span id="line2919"></span>the uncertainty of these passages there has been much speculation
<span id="line2920"></span>regarding the original home of the Angli. One theory, which however
<span id="line2921"></span>has little to recommend it, is that they dwelt in the basin of the
<span id="line2922"></span>Saale (in the neighbourhood of the canton Engilin), from which region
<span id="line2923"></span>the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> is believed
<span id="line2924"></span>by many to have come. At the present time the majority of scholars
<span id="line2925"></span>believe that the Angli had lived from the beginning on the coasts of
<span id="line2926"></span>the Baltic, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula.
<span id="line2927"></span>The evidence for this view is derived partly from English and Danish
<span id="line2928"></span>traditions dealing with persons and events of the 4th century (see
<span id="line2929"></span>below), and partly from the fact that striking affinities to the cult
<span id="line2930"></span>of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in Scandinavian,
<span id="line2931"></span>especially Swedish and Danish, religion. Investigations in this
<span id="line2932"></span>subject have rendered it very probable that the island of Nerthus was
<span id="line2933"></span>Sjaelland (Zealand), and it is further to be observed that the kings
<span id="line2934"></span>of Wessex traced their ancestry ultimately to a certain Scyld, who
<span id="line2935"></span>is clearly to be identified with Ski<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>ldr, the mythical founder of the
<span id="line2936"></span>Danish royal family (Ski<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>ldungar). In English tradition this person is
<span id="line2937"></span>connected with <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Scedeland<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> (pl.), a name which may have been applied
<span id="line2938"></span>to Sjaelland as well as Sk<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>aring;</span>ne, while in Scandinavian tradition he
<span id="line2939"></span>is specially associated with the ancient royal residence at Leire in
<span id="line2940"></span>Sjaelland.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line2941"></span>
<span id="line2942"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Bede states that the Angli before they came to Britain dwelt in a
<span id="line2943"></span>land called Angulus, and similar evidence is given by the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Historia
<span id="line2944"></span>Brittonum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. King Alfred and the chronicler <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelweard identified
<span id="line2945"></span>this place with the district which is now called Angel in the province
<span id="line2946"></span>of Schleswig (Slesvig), though it may then have been of greater
<span id="line2947"></span>extent, and this identification agrees very well with the indications
<span id="line2948"></span>given by Bede. Full confirmation is afforded by English and Danish
<span id="line2949"></span>traditions relating to two kings named Wermund (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and Offa
<span id="line2950"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), from whom the Mercian royal family were descended,
<span id="line2951"></span>and whose exploits are connected with Angel, Schleswig and Rendsburg.
<span id="line2952"></span>Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig,
<span id="line2953"></span>father and son, in their service, Frowinus (Freawine) and Wigo (Wig),
<span id="line2954"></span>from whom the royal family of Wessex claimed descent. During the
<span id="line2955"></span>5th century the Angli invaded this country (see BRITAIN,
<span id="line2956"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Anglo-Saxon</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), after which time their name does not recur on the

<span id="line2958"></span>
<span id="line2959"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The province of Schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric
<span id="line2960"></span>antiquities which date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries.
<span id="line2961"></span>Among the places where these have been found, special mention should
<span id="line2962"></span>be made of the large cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld, between
<span id="line2963"></span>Rendsburg and Eckernf<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>rde, which has yielded many urns and brooches
<span id="line2964"></span>closely resembling those found in heathen graves in England. Of still
<span id="line2965"></span>greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsbjaerg (in Angel)
<span id="line2966"></span>and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments,
<span id="line2967"></span>articles of clothing, agricultural implements, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., and in the latter
<span id="line2968"></span>case even ships. By the help of these discoveries we are able to
<span id="line2969"></span>reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of English civilization in the

<span id="line2994"></span>Christian Church consisting of the various churches in communion with
<span id="line2995"></span>the Church of England. The necessity for such a phrase as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Anglican
<span id="line2996"></span>Communion,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> first used in the 19th century, marked at once the immense
<span id="line2997"></span>development of the Anglican Church in modern times and the change
<span id="line2998"></span>which has taken place in the traditional conceptions of its character
<span id="line2999"></span>and sphere. The Church of England itself is the subject of a separate
<span id="line3000"></span>article (see ENGLAND, CHURCH OF); and it is not without significance
<span id="line3001"></span>that for more than two centuries after the Reformation the history
<span id="line3002"></span>of Anglicanism is practically confined to its developments within the
<span id="line3003"></span>limits of the British Isles. Even in Ireland, where it was for over
<span id="line3004"></span>three centuries the established religion, and in Scotland, where it
<span id="line3005"></span>early gave way to the dominant Presbyterianism, its religious was long
<span id="line3006"></span>overshadowed by its political significance. The Church, in fact,
<span id="line3007"></span>while still claiming to be Catholic in its creeds and in its religious
<span id="line3008"></span>practice, had ceased to be Catholic in its institutional conception,
<span id="line3009"></span>which was now bound up with a particular state and also with a
<span id="line3010"></span>particular conception of that state. To the native Irishman and the
<span id="line3011"></span>Scotsman, as indeed to most Englishmen, the Anglican Church was one of
<span id="line3012"></span>the main buttresses of the supremacy of the English crown and nation.
<span id="line3013"></span>This conception of the relations of church and state was hardly
<span id="line3014"></span>favourable to missionary zeal; and in the age succeeding the
<span id="line3015"></span>Reformation there was no disposition on the part of the English Church
<span id="line3016"></span>to emulate the wonderful activity of the Jesuits, which, in the 16th
<span id="line3017"></span>and 17th centuries, brought to the Church of Rome in countries beyond
<span id="line3018"></span>the ocean compensation for what she had lost in Europe through the
<span id="line3019"></span>Protestant reformation. Even when English churchmen passed beyond the
<span id="line3020"></span>seas, they carried with them their creed, but not their ecclesiastical
<span id="line3021"></span>organization. Prejudice and real or imaginary legal obstacles stood in
<span id="line3022"></span>the way of the erection of episcopal sees in the colonies; and though
<span id="line3023"></span>in the 17th century Archbishop Laud had attempted to obtain a bishop
<span id="line3024"></span>for Virginia, up to the time of the American revolution the churchmen
<span id="line3025"></span>of the colonies had to make the best of the legal fiction that
<span id="line3026"></span>their spiritual needs were looked after by the bishop of London, who
<span id="line3027"></span>occasionally sent commissaries to visit them and ordained candidates
<span id="line3028"></span>for the ministry sent to England for the purpose.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3029"></span>
<span id="line3030"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The change which has made it possible for Anglican churchmen to claim
<span id="line3031"></span>that their communion ranks with those of Rome and the Orthodox East
<span id="line3032"></span>as one of the three great historical divisions of the Catholic Church,
<span id="line3033"></span>was due, in the first instance, to the American revolution. The
<span id="line3034"></span>severance of the colonies from their allegiance to the crown brought
<span id="line3035"></span>the English bishops for the first time face to face with the idea of
<span id="line3036"></span>an Anglican Church which should have nothing to do either with the
<span id="line3037"></span>royal supremacy or with British nationality. When, on the conclusion
<span id="line3038"></span>of peace, the church-people of Connecticut sent Dr. Samuel Seabury to
<span id="line3039"></span>England, with a request to the archbishop of Canterbury to consecrate
<span id="line3040"></span>him, it is not surprising that Archbishop Moore refused. In the
<span id="line3041"></span>opinion of prelates and lawyers alike, an act of parliament was
<span id="line3042"></span>necessary before a bishop could be consecrated for a see abroad; to
<span id="line3043"></span>consecrate one for a foreign country seemed impossible, since, though
<span id="line3044"></span>the bestowal of the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>potestas ordinis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> would be valid, the
<span id="line3045"></span>crown, which, according to the law, was the source of the episcopal
<span id="line3046"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>jurisdiction</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, could hardly issue the necessary mandate for the
<span id="line3047"></span>consecration of a bishop to a see outside the realm (see BISHOP).
<span id="line3048"></span>The Scottish bishops, however, being hampered by no such legal
<span id="line3049"></span>restrictions, were more amenable; and on the 11th of November 1784
<span id="line3050"></span>Seabury was consecrated by them to the see of Connecticut. In 1786,
<span id="line3051"></span>on the initiative of the archbishop, the legal difficulties in England
<span id="line3052"></span>were removed by the act for the consecration of bishops abroad; and,
<span id="line3053"></span>on being satisfied as to the orthodoxy of the church in America and
<span id="line3054"></span>the nature of certain liturgical changes in contemplation, the two
<span id="line3055"></span>English archbishops proceeded, on the 14th of February 1787,
<span id="line3056"></span>to consecrate William White and Samuel Prevoost to the sees of
<span id="line3057"></span>Pennsylvania and New York (see PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH).</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3058"></span>
<span id="line3059"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>This act had a significance beyond the fact that it established in the
<span id="line3060"></span>United States of America a flourishing church, which, while completely
<span id="line3061"></span>loyal to its own country, is bound by special ties to the religious
<span id="line3062"></span>life of England. It marked the emergence of the Church of England from
<span id="line3063"></span>that insularity to which what may be called the territorial principles
<span id="line3064"></span>of the Reformation had condemned her. The change was slow, and it is
<span id="line3065"></span>not yet by any means complete.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3066"></span>
<span id="line3067"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Since the Church of England, whatever her attitude towards the
<span id="line3068"></span>traditional Catholic doctrines, never disputed the validity of
<span id="line3069"></span>Catholic orders whether Roman or Orthodox, nor the jurisdiction of
<span id="line3070"></span>Catholic bishops in foreign countries, the expansion of the Anglican
<span id="line3071"></span>Church has been in no sense conceived as a Protestant aggressive
<span id="line3072"></span>movement against Rome. Occasional exceptions, such as the consecration
<span id="line3073"></span>by Archbishop Plunket of Dublin of a bishop for the reformed church in
<span id="line3074"></span>Spain, raised so strong a protest as to prove the rule. In the main,
<span id="line3075"></span>then, the expansion of the Anglican Church has followed that of the
<span id="line3076"></span>British empire, or, as in America, of its daughter states; its claim,
<span id="line3077"></span>so far as rights of jurisdiction are concerned, is to be the Church
<span id="line3078"></span>of England and the English race, while recognizing its special duties
<span id="line3079"></span>towards the non-Christian populations subject to the empire or brought
<span id="line3080"></span>within the reach of its influence. As against the Church of Rome, with
<span id="line3081"></span>its system of rigid centralization, the Anglican Church represents the
<span id="line3082"></span>principle of local autonomy, which it holds to be once more primitive
<span id="line3083"></span>and more catholic. In this respect the Anglican communion has
<span id="line3084"></span>developed on the lines defined in her articles at the Reformation;
<span id="line3085"></span>but, though in principle there is no great difference between a church
<span id="line3086"></span>defined by national, and a church defined by racial boundaries, there
<span id="line3087"></span>is an immense difference in effect, especially when the race<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>as in

<span id="line3096"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>On the 12th of August 1787 Dr. Charles Inglis was consecrated bishop
<span id="line3097"></span>of Nova Scotia, with jurisdiction over all the British possessions in
<span id="line3098"></span>North America. In 1793 the see of the Qu<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>bec was founded; Jamaica
<span id="line3099"></span>and Barbados followed in 1824, and Toronto and Newfoundland in 1839.
<span id="line3100"></span>Meanwhile the needs of India has been tardily met, on the urgent
<span id="line3101"></span>representations in parliament of William Wilberforce and others, by
<span id="line3102"></span>the consecration of Dr. T. F. Middleton as bishop of Calcutta, with
<span id="line3103"></span>three archdeacons to assist him. In 1817 Ceylon was added to his
<span id="line3104"></span>charge; in 1823 all British subjects in the East Indies and the
<span id="line3105"></span>islands of the Indian Ocean; and in 1824 <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>New South Wales and its
<span id="line3106"></span>dependencies<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>! Some five years later, on the nomination of the duke
<span id="line3107"></span>of Wellington, William Broughton was sent out to work in this enormous
<span id="line3108"></span>jurisdiction as archdeacon of Australia. Soon afterwards, in 1835
<span id="line3109"></span>and 1837, the sees of Madras and Bombay were founded; whilst in 1836
<span id="line3110"></span>Broughton himself was consecrated as first bishop of Australia. Thus
<span id="line3111"></span>down to 1840 there were but ten colonial bishops; and of these several
<span id="line3112"></span>were so hampered by civil regulations that they were little more
<span id="line3113"></span>than government chaplains in episcopal orders. In April of that year,
<span id="line3114"></span>however, Bishop Blomfield of London published his famous letter to the
<span id="line3115"></span>archbishop of Canterbury, declaring that <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>an episcopal church without
<span id="line3116"></span>a bishop is a contradiction in terms,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and strenuously advocating a
<span id="line3117"></span>great effort for the extension of the episcopate. It was not in vain.
<span id="line3118"></span>The plan was taken up with enthusiasm, and on Whitsun Tuesday of 1841
<span id="line3119"></span>the bishops of the United Kingdom met and issued a declaration which
<span id="line3120"></span>inaugurated the Colonial Bishoprics Council. Subsequent
<span id="line3121"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0020</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0020</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0020]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3122"></span>declarations in 1872 and 1891 have served both to record
<span id="line3123"></span>progress and to stimulate to new effort. The diocese of New Zealand
<span id="line3124"></span>was founded in 1841, being endowed by the Church Missionary Society
<span id="line3125"></span>through the council, and George Augustus Selwyn was chosen as the
<span id="line3126"></span>first bishop. Since then the increase has gone on, as the result both
<span id="line3127"></span>of home effort and of the action of the colonial churches. Moreover,
<span id="line3128"></span>in many cases bishops have been sent to inaugurate new missions, as
<span id="line3129"></span>in the cases of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, Lebombo,
<span id="line3130"></span>Corea and New Guinea; and the missionary jurisdictions so founded
<span id="line3131"></span>develop in time into dioceses. Thus, instead of the ten colonial
<span id="line3132"></span>jurisdictions of 1841, there are now about a hundred foreign and
<span id="line3133"></span>colonial jurisdictions, in addition to those of the Protestant
<span id="line3134"></span>Episcopal Church of the United States.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3135"></span>
<span id="line3136"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>It was only very gradually that these dioceses acquired legislative
<span id="line3137"></span>independence and a determinate organization. At first, sees were
<span id="line3138"></span>created and bishops were nominated by the crown by means of letters
<span id="line3139"></span>patent; and in some cases an income was assigned out of public
<span id="line3140"></span>funds. Moreover, for many years all bishops alike were consecrated in
<span id="line3141"></span>England, took the customary <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>oath of due obedience<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> to the archbishop
<span id="line3142"></span>of Canterbury, and were regarded as his extra-territorial suffragans.
<span id="line3143"></span>But by degrees changes have been made on all these points.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3146"></span>
<span id="line3147"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(1) Local conditions soon made a provincial organization necessary,
<span id="line3148"></span>and it was gradually introduced. The bishop of Calcutta received
<span id="line3149"></span>letters patent as metropolitan of India when the sees of Madras and
<span id="line3150"></span>Bombay were founded; and fresh patents were issued to Bishop Broughton
<span id="line3151"></span>in 1847 and Bishop Gray in 1853, as metropolitans of Australia and
<span id="line3152"></span>South Africa respectively. Similar action was taken in 1858, when
<span id="line3153"></span>Bishop Selwyn became metropolitan of New Zealand; and again in 1860,
<span id="line3154"></span>when, on the petition of the Canadian bishops to the crown and the
<span id="line3155"></span>colonial legislature for permission to elect a metropolitan, letters
<span id="line3156"></span>patent were issued appointing Bishop Fulford of Montreal to that
<span id="line3157"></span>office. Since then metropolitans have been chosen and provinces formed
<span id="line3158"></span>by regular synodical action, a process greatly encouraged by
<span id="line3159"></span>the resolutions of the Lambeth conferences on the subject. The
<span id="line3160"></span>constitution of these provinces is not uniform. In some cases, as
<span id="line3161"></span>South Africa, New South Wales, and Queensland, the metropolitan see
<span id="line3162"></span>is fixed. Elsewhere, as in New Zealand, where no single city can claim
<span id="line3163"></span>pre-eminence, the metropolitan is either elected or else is the senior
<span id="line3164"></span>bishop by consecration. Two further developments must be mentioned:
<span id="line3165"></span>(a) The creation of diocesan and provincial synods, the first diocesan
<span id="line3166"></span>synod to meet being that of New Zealand in 1844, whilst the formation
<span id="line3167"></span>of a provincial synod was foreshadowed by a conference of Australasian
<span id="line3168"></span>bishops at Sydney in 1850; (b) towards the close of the 19th
<span id="line3169"></span>century the title of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>archbishop</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> began to be assumed by the
<span id="line3170"></span>metropolitans of several provinces. It was first assumed by the
<span id="line3171"></span>metropolitans of Canada and Rupert's Land, at the desire of the
<span id="line3172"></span>Canadian general synod in 1893; and subsequently, in accordance with
<span id="line3173"></span>a resolution of the Lambeth conference of 1897, it was given by their
<span id="line3174"></span>synods to the bishop of Sydney as metropolitan of New South Wales
<span id="line3175"></span>and to the bishop of Cape Town as metropolitan of South Africa. Civil
<span id="line3176"></span>obstacles have hitherto delayed its adoption by the metropolitan of
<span id="line3177"></span>India.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3178"></span>

<span id="line3180"></span>
<span id="line3181"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(2) By degrees, also, the colonial churches have been freed from their
<span id="line3182"></span>rather burdensome relations with the state. The church of the West
<span id="line3183"></span>Indies was disestablished and disendowed in 1868. In 1857 it was
<span id="line3184"></span>decided, in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Regina</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> v. </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Eton College</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, that the crown
<span id="line3185"></span>could not claim the presentation to a living when it had appointed the
<span id="line3186"></span>former incumbent to a colonial bishopric, as it does in the case of an
<span id="line3187"></span>English bishopric. In 1861, after some protest from the crown lawyers,
<span id="line3188"></span>two missionary bishops were consecrated without letters patent for
<span id="line3189"></span>regions outside British territory: C. F. Mackenzie for the Zambezi
<span id="line3190"></span>region and J. C. Patteson for Melanesia, by the metropolitans of Cape
<span id="line3191"></span>Town and New Zealand respectively. In 1863 the privy council declared,
<span id="line3192"></span>in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Long</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> v. </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Bishop of Cape Town</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, that <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>the Church of
<span id="line3193"></span>England, in places where there is no church established by law, is in
<span id="line3194"></span>the same situation with any other religious body.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In 1865 it adjudged
<span id="line3195"></span>Bishop Gray's letters patent, as metropolitan of Cape Town, to be
<span id="line3196"></span>powerless to enable him <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>to exercise any coercive jurisdiction, or
<span id="line3197"></span>hold any court or tribunal for that purpose,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> since the Cape colony
<span id="line3198"></span>already possessed legislative institutions when they were issued; and
<span id="line3199"></span>his deposition of Bishop Colenso was declared to be <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>null and void in
<span id="line3200"></span>law<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>re The Bishop of Natal</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>). With the exception of Colenso
<span id="line3201"></span>the South African bishops forthwith surrendered their patents, and
<span id="line3202"></span>formally accepted Bishop Gray as their metropolitan, an example
<span id="line3203"></span>followed in 1865 in the province of New Zealand. In 1862, when the
<span id="line3204"></span>diocese of Ontario was formed, the bishop was elected in Canada, and
<span id="line3205"></span>consecrated under a royal mandate, letters patent being by this time
<span id="line3206"></span>entirely discredited. And when, in 1867, a coadjutor was chosen for
<span id="line3207"></span>the bishop of Toronto, an application for a royal mandate produced
<span id="line3208"></span>the reply from the colonial secretary that <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>it was not the part of the
<span id="line3209"></span>crown to interfere in the creation of a new bishop or bishopric, and
<span id="line3210"></span>not consistent with the dignity of the crown that he should advise Her
<span id="line3211"></span>Majesty to issue a mandate which would not be worth the paper on which
<span id="line3212"></span>it was written, and which, having been sent out to Canada, might be
<span id="line3213"></span>disregarded in the most complete manner.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> And at the present day the
<span id="line3214"></span>colonial churches are entirely free in this matter. This, however,
<span id="line3215"></span>is not the case with the church in India. Here the bishops of sees
<span id="line3216"></span>founded down to 1879 receive a stipend from the revenue (with the
<span id="line3217"></span>exception of the bishop of Ceylon, who no longer does so). They are
<span id="line3218"></span>not only nominated by the crown and consecrated under letters
<span id="line3219"></span>patent, but the appointment is expressly subjected <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>to such power of
<span id="line3220"></span>revocation and recall as is by law vested<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> in the crown; and where
<span id="line3221"></span>additional oversight was necessary for the church in Tinnevelly, it
<span id="line3222"></span>could only be secured by the consecration of two assistant bishops,
<span id="line3223"></span>who worked under a commission for the archbishop of Canterbury which
<span id="line3224"></span>was to expire on the death of the bishop of Madras. Since then,
<span id="line3225"></span>however, new sees have been founded which are under no such
<span id="line3226"></span>restrictions: by the creation of dioceses either in native states
<span id="line3227"></span>(Travancore and Cochin), or out of the existing dioceses (Chota
<span id="line3228"></span>Nagpur, Lucknow, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c.). In the latter case there is no </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>legal</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3229"></span>subdivision of the older diocese, the new bishop administering
<span id="line3230"></span>such districts as belonged to it under commission from its bishop,
<span id="line3231"></span>provision being made, however, that in all matters ecclesiastical
<span id="line3232"></span>there shall be no appeal but to the metropolitan of India.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3233"></span>
<span id="line3234"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">div</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>='<a class="attribute-value">sidenote</a>'&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Spiritual autonomy.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">div</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3235"></span>
<span id="line3236"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(3) By degrees, also, the relations of colonial churches to the
<span id="line3237"></span>archbishop of Canterbury have changed. Until 1855 no colonial bishop
<span id="line3238"></span>was consecrated outside the British Isles, the first instance being
<span id="line3239"></span>Dr. MacDougall of Labuan, consecrated in India under a commission
<span id="line3240"></span>from the archbishop of Canterbury; and until 1874 it was held to be
<span id="line3241"></span>unlawful for a bishop to be consecrated in England without taking the
<span id="line3242"></span>suffragan's oath of due obedience. This necessity was removed by
<span id="line3243"></span>the Colonial Clergy Act of 1874, which permits the archbishop at his
<span id="line3244"></span>discretion to dispense with the oath. This, however, has not been done
<span id="line3245"></span>in all cases; and as late as 1890 it was taken by the metropolitan of
<span id="line3246"></span>Sydney at his consecration. Thus the constituent parts of the Anglican
<span id="line3247"></span>communion gradually acquire autonomy: missionary jurisdictions develop
<span id="line3248"></span>into organized dioceses, and dioceses are grouped into provinces with
<span id="line3249"></span>canons of their own. But the most complete autonomy does not involve
<span id="line3250"></span>isolation. The churches are in full communion with one another, and
<span id="line3251"></span>act together in many ways; missionary jurisdictions and dioceses are
<span id="line3252"></span>mapped out by common arrangement, and even transferred if it seems
<span id="line3253"></span>advisable; </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>e.g.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> the diocese Honolulu (Hawaii), previously under
<span id="line3254"></span>the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury, was transferred
<span id="line3255"></span>in 1900 to the Episcopal Church in the United States on account of
<span id="line3256"></span>political changes. Though the see of Canterbury claims no primacy
<span id="line3257"></span>over the Anglican communion analogous to that exercised over the
<span id="line3258"></span>Roman Church by the popes, it is regarded with a strong affection and
<span id="line3259"></span>deference, which shows itself by frequent consultation and interchange
<span id="line3260"></span>of greetings. There is also a strong common life emphasized by common
<span id="line3261"></span>action.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3267"></span> instituted by Archbishop Longley in 1867, and known as
<span id="line3268"></span>the Lambeth Conferences (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), though even for the Anglican
<span id="line3269"></span>communion they have not the authority of an ecumenical synod, and
<span id="line3270"></span>their decisions are rather of the nature of counsels than commands,
<span id="line3271"></span>have done much to promote the harmony and co-operation of the various
<span id="line3272"></span>branches of the Church. An even more imposing manifestation of this
<span id="line3273"></span>common life was given by the great pan-Anglican congress held in
<span id="line3274"></span>London between the 12th and 24th of June 1908, which preceded the
<span id="line3275"></span>Lambeth conference opened on the 5th of July. The idea of this
<span id="line3276"></span>originated with Bishop Montgomery, secretary to the Society for the
<span id="line3277"></span>Propagation of the Gospel, and was endorsed by a resolution of the
<span id="line3278"></span>United Boards of Mission in 1903. As the result of negotiations and
<span id="line3279"></span>preparations extending over five years, 250 bishops, together with
<span id="line3280"></span>delegates, clerical and lay, from every diocese in the Anglican
<span id="line3281"></span>communion, met in London, the opening service of intercession being
<span id="line3282"></span>held in Westminster Abbey. In its general character, the meeting
<span id="line3283"></span>was but a Church congress on an enlarged scale, and the subjects
<span id="line3284"></span>discussed, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>e.g.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. the attitude of churchmen towards the question
<span id="line3285"></span>of the marriage laws or that of socialism, followed much the same
<span id="line3286"></span>lines. The congress, of course, had no power to decide or to legislate
<span id="line3287"></span>for the Church, its main value being in drawing its scattered members
<span id="line3288"></span>closer together, in bringing the newer and more isolated branches into
<span id="line3289"></span>consciousness of their contact with the parent stem, and in opening
<span id="line3290"></span>the eyes of the Church of England to the point of view and the
<span id="line3291"></span>peculiar problems of the daughter-churches.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3328"></span>and may be said to date from the time when man was in the infancy of
<span id="line3329"></span>the Stone Age, eking out a precarious existence by the slaughter of
<span id="line3330"></span>any living thing which he could reach with the rude weapons at his
<span id="line3331"></span>command. It is probable that attack on fishes was at first much the
<span id="line3332"></span>same as attack on animals, a matter of force rather than of guile, and
<span id="line3333"></span>conducted by means of a rude spear with a flint head. It is probable,
<span id="line3334"></span>too, that the primitive harpooners were not signally successful in
<span id="line3335"></span>their efforts, and so set their wits to work to devise other means of
<span id="line3336"></span>getting at the abundant food which waited for them in every piece of
<span id="line3337"></span>water near their caves. Observation would soon show them that fish fed
<span id="line3338"></span>greedily on each other and on other inhabitants of the water or
<span id="line3339"></span>living things that fell into it, and so, no doubt, arose the idea of
<span id="line3340"></span>entangling the prey by means of its appetite. Hence came the notion of
<span id="line3341"></span>the first hook, which, it seems certain, was not a hook at all but a
<span id="line3342"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>gorge,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> a piece of flint or stone which the fish could swallow with
<span id="line3343"></span>the bait but which it could not eject afterwards. From remains found
<span id="line3344"></span>in cave-dwellings and their neighbourhood in different parts of the
<span id="line3345"></span>world it is obvious that these gorges varied in shape, but in general
<span id="line3346"></span>the idea was the same, a narrow strip of stone or flake of flint,
<span id="line3347"></span>either straight or slightly curved at the ends, with a groove in the
<span id="line3348"></span>middle round which the line could be fastened. Buried in the bait it
<span id="line3349"></span>would be swallowed end first; then the tightening of the line would
<span id="line3350"></span>fix it cross-wise in the quarry's, stomach or gullet and so the
<span id="line3351"></span>capture would be assured. The device still lingers in France and in
<span id="line3352"></span>a few remote parts of England in the method of catching eels which is
<span id="line3353"></span>known as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>sniggling.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In this a needle buried in a worm plays the part
<span id="line3354"></span>of the prehistoric gorge.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3355"></span>
<span id="line3356"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The evolution of the fish-hook from the slightly curved gorge is
<span id="line3357"></span>easily intelligible. The ends became more and more curved, until
<span id="line3358"></span>eventually an object not unlike a double hook was attained. This
<span id="line3359"></span>development would be materially assisted by man's discovery of the
<span id="line3360"></span>uses of bronze and its adaptability to his requirements. The single
<span id="line3361"></span>hook, of the pattern more or less familiar to us, was possibly a
<span id="line3362"></span>concession of the lake-dweller to what may even then have been a
<span id="line3363"></span>problem<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>education<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> of fish, and to a recognition of the fact
<span id="line3364"></span>that sport with the crude old methods was falling off. But it is
<span id="line3365"></span>also not improbable that in some parts of the world the single
<span id="line3366"></span>hook developed </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>pari passu</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> with the double, and that, on the
<span id="line3367"></span>sea-shore for instance, where man was able to employ so adaptable
<span id="line3368"></span>a substance as shell, the first hook was a curved fragment of shell
<span id="line3369"></span>lashed with fibre to a piece of wood or bone, in such a way that the
<span id="line3370"></span>shell formed the bend of the hook while the wood or bone formed the
<span id="line3371"></span>shank. Both early remains and recent hooks from the Fiji Islands bear
<span id="line3372"></span>out this supposition. It is also likely that flint, horn and bone were
<span id="line3373"></span>pressed into service in a similar manner. The nature of the line or
<span id="line3374"></span>the rod that may have been used with these early hooks is largely
<span id="line3375"></span>a matter of conjecture. The first line was perhaps the tendril of a
<span id="line3376"></span>plant, the first rod possibly a sapling tree. But it is fairly obvious
<span id="line3377"></span>that the rod must have been suggested by the necessity of getting the
<span id="line3378"></span>bait out over obstacles which lay between the fisherman and the water,
<span id="line3379"></span>and that it was a device for increasing both the reach of the arm
<span id="line3380"></span>and the length of the line. It seems not improbable that the rod very
<span id="line3381"></span>early formed a part of the fisherman's equipment.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3384"></span>late in the days of chronicles, angling appears to have remained a
<span id="line3385"></span>practice; its development into an art or sport is a modern idea. In
<span id="line3386"></span>the earliest literature references to angling are not very numerous,
<span id="line3387"></span>but there are passages in the Old Testament which show that
<span id="line3388"></span>fish-taking with hook as well as net was one of the common industries
<span id="line3389"></span>in the East, and that fish, where it was obtainable, formed an
<span id="line3390"></span>important article of diet. In </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Numbers</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (xi. 5) the children of
<span id="line3391"></span>Israel mourn for the fish which they <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>did eat in Egypt freely.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> So
<span id="line3392"></span>much too is proved by the monuments of Egypt; indeed more, for the
<span id="line3393"></span>figures found in some of the Egyptian fishing pictures using short
<span id="line3394"></span>rods and stout lines are sometimes attired after the manner of those
<span id="line3395"></span>who were great in the land. This indicates that angling had already,
<span id="line3396"></span>in a highly civilized country, taken its place among the methods
<span id="line3397"></span>of diversion at the disposal of the wealthy, though from the
<span id="line3398"></span>uncompromising nature of the tackle depicted and the apparent
<span id="line3399"></span>simplicity of the fish it would scarcely be safe to assume that in
<span id="line3400"></span>Egypt angling arrived at the dignity of becoming an <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>art.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In Europe
<span id="line3401"></span>it took very much longer for the taking of fish to be regarded even as
<span id="line3402"></span>an </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0022</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0022</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0022]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3403"></span> amusement, and the earliest references to it in the
<span id="line3404"></span>Greek and Latin classics are not very satisfying to the sportsman. There is, however, a passage in the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Odyssey</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (xii. 247) which is
<span id="line3405"></span>of considerable importance, as it shows that fishing with rod and line
<span id="line3406"></span>was well enough understood in early Greece to be used as a popular
<span id="line3407"></span>illustration. It occurs in the well-known scene where Scylla seizes
<span id="line3408"></span>the companions of Odysseus out of the ship and bears them upwards,
<span id="line3409"></span>just as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>some fisher on a headland with a long rod<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> brings small
<span id="line3410"></span>fishes gasping to the shore. Another important, though comparatively
<span id="line3411"></span>late, passage in Greek poetry is the twenty-first idyll of Theocritus.
<span id="line3412"></span>In this the fisherman Asphalion relates how in a dream he hooked
<span id="line3413"></span>a large golden fish and describes graphically, albeit with some
<span id="line3414"></span>obscurity of language, how he <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>played<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> it. Asphalion used a rod and
<span id="line3415"></span>fished from a rock, much after the manner of the Homeric angler. Among
<span id="line3416"></span>other Greek writers, Herodotus has a good many references to fish and
<span id="line3417"></span>fishing; the capture of fish is once or twice mentioned or implied
<span id="line3418"></span>by Plato, notably in the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Laws</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (vii. 823); Aristotle deals with
<span id="line3419"></span>fishes in his </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Natural History</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, and there are one or two fishing
<span id="line3420"></span>passages in the anthology. But in Greek literature, as a whole the
<span id="line3421"></span>subject of angling is not at all prominent. In writers of late Greek,
<span id="line3422"></span>however, there is more material. Plutarch, for instance, gives us the
<span id="line3423"></span>famous story of the fishing match between Antony and Cleopatra, which
<span id="line3424"></span>has been utilized by Shakespeare. Moreover, it is in Greek that
<span id="line3425"></span>the first complete treatise on fishing which has come down to us
<span id="line3426"></span>is written, the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Halieutica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Oppian (c. A.D. 169). It is a
<span id="line3427"></span>hexameter poem in five books with perhaps more technical than sporting
<span id="line3428"></span>interest, and not so much even of that as the length of the work would
<span id="line3429"></span>suggest. Still it contains some information about tackle and methods,
<span id="line3430"></span>and some passages describing battles with big fish, in the right
<span id="line3431"></span>spirit of enthusiasm. Also in Greek is what is famous as the first
<span id="line3432"></span>reference in literature to fly-fishing, in the fifteenth book of
<span id="line3433"></span>Aelian's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Natural History</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (3rd century A.D.). It is there
<span id="line3434"></span>described how the Macedonians captured a certain spotted fish in
<span id="line3435"></span>the river Astraeus by means of a lure composed of coloured wool
<span id="line3436"></span>and feathers, which was presumably used in the manner now known as
<span id="line3437"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dapping.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> That there were other Greek writers who dealt with fish and
<span id="line3438"></span>fishing and composed <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>halieutics<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> we know from Athenaeus. In the first
<span id="line3439"></span>book of his </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Deipnosophistae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> he gives a list of them. But he
<span id="line3440"></span>compares their work unfavourably with the passage of Homer already
<span id="line3441"></span>cited, in a way which suggests that their knowledge of angling was not
<span id="line3442"></span>a great advance upon the knowledge of their remote literary ancestors.
<span id="line3443"></span>In Latin literature allusions to angling are rather more numerous than
<span id="line3444"></span>in Greek, but on the whole they are unimportant. Part of a poem by
<span id="line3445"></span>Ovid, the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Halieuticon</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, composed during the poet's exile at Tomi
<span id="line3446"></span>after A.D. 9, still survives. In other Roman writers the subject is
<span id="line3447"></span>only treated by way of allusion or illustration. Martial, however,
<span id="line3448"></span>provides, among other passages, what may perhaps be entitled to rank
<span id="line3449"></span>as the earliest notice of private fishery rights<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the epigram </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Ad
<span id="line3450"></span>Piscatorem</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, which warns would-be poachers from casting a line
<span id="line3451"></span>in the Baian lake. Pliny the elder devoted the ninth book of his
<span id="line3452"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Natural History</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> to fishes and water-life, and Plautus, Cicero,
<span id="line3453"></span>Catullus, Horace, Juvenal, Pliny the younger and Suetonius all allude
<span id="line3454"></span>to angling here and there. Agricultural writers, too, such as Varro
<span id="line3455"></span>and Columella, deal with the subject of fish ponds and stews rather
<span id="line3456"></span>fully. Later than any of these, but still just included in Latin
<span id="line3457"></span>literature, we have Ausonius (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>c</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. A.D. 320) and his well-known
<span id="line3458"></span>idyll the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Mosella</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, which contains a good deal about the fish
<span id="line3459"></span>of the Moselle and the methods of catching them. In this poem is to
<span id="line3460"></span>be found the first recognizable description of members of the
<span id="line3461"></span>salmon family, and, though the manner of their application is rather
<span id="line3462"></span>doubtful, the names </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>salmo, salar</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>fario</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> strike a
<span id="line3463"></span>responsive note in the breast of the modern angler.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3464"></span>
<span id="line3465"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Post-classical Literature</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>As to what happened in the world
<span id="line3466"></span>of angling in the first few centuries of the Christian era we know
<span id="line3467"></span>little. It may be inferred, however, that both fish and fishermen
<span id="line3468"></span>occupied a more honourable position in Christendom than they ever did
<span id="line3469"></span>before. The prominence of fishermen in the gospel narratives would in
<span id="line3470"></span>itself have been enough to bring this about, but it also happened
<span id="line3471"></span>that the Greek word for fish, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#921;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#935;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#920;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#933;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#931;</span>, had an anagrammatic
<span id="line3472"></span>significance which the devout were not slow to perceive. The initials
<span id="line3473"></span>of the word resolve into what is practically a confession of faith,
<span id="line3474"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#7992;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#951;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#963;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#959;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8166;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#962;</span> <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#935;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#961;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#953;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#963;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#964;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8056;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#962;</span> <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#920;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#949;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#959;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8166;</span> <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#933;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#7985;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8056;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#962;</span> <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#931;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#969;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#964;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8053;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#961;</span> (Jesus Christ, Son of God,
<span id="line3475"></span>Saviour). It is therefore not surprising that we find the fish very
<span id="line3476"></span>prominent as a sacred emblem in the painting and sculpture of
<span id="line3477"></span>the primitive church, or that Clement of Alexandria should have
<span id="line3478"></span>recommended it, among other things, as a device for signet rings or
<span id="line3479"></span>seals. The fisherman too is frequently represented in early Christian
<span id="line3480"></span>art, and it is worthy of remark that he more often uses a line and
<span id="line3481"></span>hook than a net. The references to fish and fishing scattered about
<span id="line3482"></span>in the writings of the early fathers for the most part reflect the two
<span id="line3483"></span>ideas of the sacredness of the fish and divine authorization of the
<span id="line3484"></span>fisherman; the second idea certainly prevailed until the time of Izaak
<span id="line3485"></span>Walton, for he uses it to justify his pastime. It is also not unlikely
<span id="line3486"></span>that the practice of fasting (in many cases fish was allowed when meat
<span id="line3487"></span>was forbidden) gave the art of catching fish additional importance.
<span id="line3488"></span>It seems at any rate to have been a consideration of weight when
<span id="line3489"></span>sites were chosen for monasteries in Europe, and in many cases when
<span id="line3490"></span>no fish-producing river was at hand the lack was supplied by the
<span id="line3491"></span>construction of fish-ponds. Despite all this, however, save for an
<span id="line3492"></span>occasional allusion in the early fathers, there is hardly a connecting
<span id="line3493"></span>link between the literature of Pagan Rome and the literature
<span id="line3494"></span>that sprang up on the invention of printing. One volume, the
<span id="line3495"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Geoponica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, a Greek compilation concerning whose authorship
<span id="line3496"></span>and date there has been much dispute, is attributed in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bibliotheca
<span id="line3497"></span>Piscatoria</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> to the beginning of the 10th century. It contains one
<span id="line3498"></span>book on fish, fish-ponds and fishing, with prescriptions for baits,
<span id="line3499"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., extracted for the most part from other writers. But it seems
<span id="line3500"></span>doubtful whether its date should not be placed very much earlier.
<span id="line3501"></span>Tradition makes it a Carthaginian treatise translated into Greek. A
<span id="line3502"></span>more satisfactory fragment of fishing literature is to be found in the
<span id="line3503"></span>Colloquy of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>lfric, written (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>ad pucros linguae latinae locutionis
<span id="line3504"></span>exercendos</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) towards the end of the same century. <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>lfric became
<span id="line3505"></span>archbishop of Canterbury in A.D. 995, and the passage in the
<span id="line3506"></span>Anglo-Saxon text-book takes honourable rank as the earliest reference
<span id="line3507"></span>to fishing in English writings, though it is not of any great length.
<span id="line3508"></span>It is to be noted that the fisher who takes a share in the colloquy
<span id="line3509"></span>states that he prefers fishing in the river to fishing in the sea.
<span id="line3510"></span>Ascribed to the 13th or 14th century is a Latin poem </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>De Vetula</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>,
<span id="line3511"></span>whose author was apparently Richard de Fournival. It contains a
<span id="line3512"></span>passage on angling, and was placed to the credit of Ovid when first
<span id="line3513"></span>printed (c. 1470). A manuscript in the British museum, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Comptes des
<span id="line3514"></span>p<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>cheries de l'<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>glise de Troyes</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (A.D. 1349-1413), gives a minute
<span id="line3515"></span>account of the fisheries with the weights of fish captured and the
<span id="line3516"></span>expenses of working. There is, however, practically nothing else
<span id="line3517"></span>of importance till we come to the first printed book on angling (a
<span id="line3518"></span>translation of Oppian, 1478, excepted), and so to the beginning of
<span id="line3519"></span>the literature proper. This first book was a little volume printed
<span id="line3520"></span>in Antwerp probably in 1492 at the press of Matthias van der Goes. In
<span id="line3521"></span>size it is little more than a pamphlet, and it treats of birds as well
<span id="line3522"></span>as fish:<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Dit Boecxken leert hoe men mach Voghelen ... ende ...
<span id="line3523"></span>visschen vangen metten kanden. Ende oeck andersins....</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>This book
<span id="line3524"></span>teaches how one may catch birds ... and ... fish with the hands, and
<span id="line3525"></span>also otherwise<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>). Only one copy apparently survives, in the Denison
<span id="line3526"></span>library, and a translation privately printed for Mr. Alfred Denison in
<span id="line3527"></span>1872 was limited to twenty-five copies. At least two other editions
<span id="line3528"></span>of the book appeared in Flemish, and it also made its way, in 1502, to
<span id="line3529"></span>Germany, where, translated and with certain alterations and additions,
<span id="line3530"></span>it seems to have been re-issued frequently. Next in date comes
<span id="line3531"></span>the famous </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, printed at
<span id="line3532"></span>Westminster by Wynkyn de Worde in 1496 as a part of the second edition
<span id="line3533"></span>of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Book of St. Albans</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. The treatise is for this reason
<span id="line3534"></span>associated with the name of Dame Juliana Berners, but that somewhat
<span id="line3535"></span>dubious compiler can have had nothing whatever to do with it. The
<span id="line3536"></span>treatise is almost certainly a compilation from some earlier work on
<span id="line3537"></span>angling (<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>bokes of credence<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> are mentioned in its text), possibly
<span id="line3538"></span>from a manuscript of the earlier part of the 15th century, of which a
<span id="line3539"></span>portion is </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0023</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0023</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0023]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3540"></span> preserved in the Denison collection. This was published
<span id="line3541"></span>in 1883 by Mr. Thomas Satchell under the title </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>An Older Form of the
<span id="line3542"></span>Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. But it is also possible that
<span id="line3543"></span>a still older work was the parent of both books, for it has been held
<span id="line3544"></span>that the manuscript is an independent version. However this may be, it
<span id="line3545"></span>is certain that the treatise itself has been the parent of many other
<span id="line3546"></span>works. Many of the instructions contained in it are handed down
<span id="line3547"></span>from generation to generation with little change except in diction.
<span id="line3548"></span>Especially is this the case with the list of trout-flies, a meagre
<span id="line3549"></span>twelve, which survives in many fishing books until well into the 18th
<span id="line3550"></span>century.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3551"></span>
<span id="line3552"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>From the beginning of the 16th century the fisherman's library begins
<span id="line3553"></span>to grow apace, as, though books solely devoted to fishing are not yet
<span id="line3554"></span>frequent, works on husbandry and country pursuits almost all contain
<span id="line3555"></span>something on the subject. In Italy the fisherman and his occupation
<span id="line3556"></span>apparently were considered poetically; the word </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>pescatore</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or
<span id="line3557"></span>its cognates are common on Italian 16th and 17th century title-pages,
<span id="line3558"></span>though in many instances the fulfilment of the implied promise is
<span id="line3559"></span>not adequate, from an angler's point of view. From the pages of
<span id="line3560"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> a fairly long list of Italian
<span id="line3561"></span>writers could be gleaned. Among them may be mentioned Sannazaro
<span id="line3562"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Piscatoria</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., Rome, 1526) and Andrea Calmo (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Rime
<span id="line3563"></span>pescatorie</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, Venice, 1557). A century later was Parthenius, who
<span id="line3564"></span>published a volume of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Halieutica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> at Naples. This writer has
<span id="line3565"></span>an amusing reference to the art of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>tickling<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> trout as practised in
<span id="line3566"></span>Britain. In Germany, as has been shown, the original little Flemish
<span id="line3567"></span>treatise had a wide vogue in the 16th century, and fishing played
<span id="line3568"></span>a part in a good many books on husbandry such as that of Conrad
<span id="line3569"></span>Heresbach (1570). Fish and fish-ponds formed the main topic of a Latin
<span id="line3570"></span>work by Dubravius (1552), while Gesner in the middle of the 16th and
<span id="line3571"></span>Aldrovandi at the beginning of the 17th centuries wrote at length
<span id="line3572"></span>on the natural history of fishes. In France the subject is less well
<span id="line3573"></span>represented, but </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Les Pescheries</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Chris. de Gamon (Lyons,

<span id="line3576"></span>first published at Paris in 1600, and several times in later editions,
<span id="line3577"></span>is characterized by Messrs Westwood and Satchell as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>on the whole
<span id="line3578"></span>the most interesting contribution made by France to the literature
<span id="line3579"></span>of angling.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> England during the most part of the 16th century was
<span id="line3580"></span>evidently well enough served by the original treatise out of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The
<span id="line3581"></span>Book of St. Albans</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. It was republished twice by Wynkyn de Worde,
<span id="line3582"></span>six or seven times by Copland, and some five times by other printers.
<span id="line3583"></span>It was also practically republished in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>A Booke of Fishing</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> by
<span id="line3584"></span>L. M. (1590). L. M. (Leonard Mascall) ranks as an angling author, but
<span id="line3585"></span>he did little more than borrow and edit the treatise. The same may
<span id="line3586"></span>be said of another version of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Book of St. Albans</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>now newly

<span id="line3592"></span>of Angling</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1613), by J(ohn) D(ennys). Esq., is one of the most
<span id="line3593"></span>important volumes in the angler's library, both on account of the
<span id="line3594"></span>excellence of the verse in which it is written and also on account of
<span id="line3595"></span>its practical value. Gervase Markham, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>the first journalist,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> as he
<span id="line3596"></span>has been called, published his first book of husbandry at the same
<span id="line3597"></span>date, and, as in most of his many books on the same subject, devoted a
<span id="line3598"></span>certain amount of space to fishing. But Markham gathered his materials
<span id="line3599"></span>in a rather shameless manner and his angling passages have little
<span id="line3600"></span>originality. Thomas Barker's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Art of Angling</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1st ed., 1651)
<span id="line3601"></span>takes a more honourable position, and received warm commendation from
<span id="line3602"></span>Izaak Walton himself, who followed it in 1653 with </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Compleat
<span id="line3603"></span>Angler</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. So much has been written about this treasured classic that
<span id="line3604"></span>it is only necessary to indicate its popularity here by saying that
<span id="line3605"></span>its editions occupy some twenty pages in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3606"></span>(1883), and that since that work was published at least forty new
<span id="line3607"></span>editions have to be added to the list. During Walton's life-time
<span id="line3608"></span>the book ran through five editions, and with the fifth (1676) was
<span id="line3609"></span>incorporated Charles Cotton's second part, the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>instructions how to
<span id="line3610"></span>angle for a trout or grayling, in a clear stream.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In some cases too
<span id="line3611"></span>there was added a third book, the fourth edition of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Experienced
<span id="line3612"></span>Angler</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, by Robert Venables (1st ed., 1662). The three books
<span id="line3613"></span>together bore the title of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Universal Angler</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. Venables's
<span id="line3614"></span>portion was dropped later, but it is worth reading, and contained
<span id="line3615"></span>sound instruction though it has not the literary merit of Walton and
<span id="line3616"></span>Cotton.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3640"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>With the 19th century angling literature becomes too big a subject to
<span id="line3641"></span>be treated in detail, and it is only possible to glance at a few of
<span id="line3642"></span>the more important books and writers. Daniel's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Rural Sports</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3643"></span>appeared in 1801; it is a treasure-house of odd facts. In 1828 Sir
<span id="line3644"></span>Humphry Davy published his famous </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmonia</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, which was reviewed
<span id="line3645"></span>in the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Quarterly</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> by Sir Walter Scott. At about this time
<span id="line3646"></span>too were appearing the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Noctes Ambrosianae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Blackwood's
<span id="line3647"></span>Magazine</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. Christopher North (Professor Wilson) often touched upon
<span id="line3648"></span>angling in them, besides contributing a good many angling articles
<span id="line3649"></span>to the magazine. In 1835 that excellent angling writer Thomas Tod
<span id="line3650"></span>Stoddart began his valuable series of books with </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Art of Angling
<span id="line3651"></span>as Practised in Scotland</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. In 1839 he published </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Songs and
<span id="line3652"></span>Poems</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, among which are pieces of great merit. During this
<span id="line3653"></span>period, too, first appeared, year by year, the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Newcastle Fishers'
<span id="line3654"></span>Garlands</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, collected by Joseph Crawhall afterwards and republished
<span id="line3655"></span>in 1864. These border verses, like Stoddart's, have often a genuine
<span id="line3656"></span>ring about them which is missing from the more polished effusions of
<span id="line3657"></span>Gay and Thomson. Alfred Ronalds's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Fly-Fisher's Entomology</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3658"></span>(1st ed., 1836) was a publication of great importance, for it marked
<span id="line3659"></span>the beginning of the scientific spirit among trout-fishers. It ran
<span id="line3660"></span>through many editions and is still a valuable book of reference.
<span id="line3661"></span>A step in angling history is also marked by George Pulman's
<span id="line3662"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Vade-Mecum of Fly-fishing for Trout</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1841), for it contains the
<span id="line3663"></span>first definite instructions on fishing with a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dry fly.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> Another is
<span id="line3664"></span>marked by Hewett Wheatley's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Rod and the Line</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1849), where
<span id="line3665"></span>is to be found the earliest reference to the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>eyed<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> hook. Yet another
<span id="line3666"></span>is marked by W. C. Stewart's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The Practical Angler</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1857), in
<span id="line3667"></span>which is taught the new doctrine of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>up-stream<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> fishing for trout.
<span id="line3668"></span>This is a book of permanent value. Among the many books of this period

<span id="line3675"></span>is to him that we owe the admirable volumes on fresh-water fishing in

<span id="line3689"></span>distinguished in style and matter. Germany and France have not
<span id="line3690"></span>contributed so largely to the modern library, but in the first country
<span id="line3691"></span>we find several useful works by Max von dem Borne, beginning with the
<span id="line3692"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Handbuch der Angelfischerei</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of 1875, and there are a good many
<span id="line3693"></span>other writers who have contributed to the subject, while in France
<span id="line3694"></span>there are a few volumes on fishing by different hands. The most
<span id="line3695"></span>noticeable is M. G. Albert Petit's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>La Truite de rivi<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>egrave;</span>re</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1897),
<span id="line3696"></span>an admirable book on fly-fishing. As yet, however, though there are
<span id="line3697"></span>many enthusiastic anglers in France, the sport has not established
<span id="line3698"></span>itself so firmly as to have inspired much literature of its own; the
<span id="line3699"></span>same may be said of Germany.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3700"></span>
<span id="line3701"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Modern Conditions</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>In the modern history of angling there are
<span id="line3702"></span>one or two features that should be touched upon. The great increase
<span id="line3703"></span>in the number of fishermen has had several results. One is a
<span id="line3704"></span>corresponding increase in the difficulty of obtaining fishing, and a
<span id="line3705"></span>notable rise in the value of rivers, especially those which are famed
<span id="line3706"></span>for salmon and trout. Salmon-fishing now may be said to have become
<span id="line3707"></span>a pastime of the rich, and there are signs that trout-fishing will
<span id="line3708"></span>before long have to be placed in the same exclusive category, while
<span id="line3709"></span>even the right to angle for less-esteemed fish will eventually be a
<span id="line3710"></span>thing of price. The development is natural, and it has naturally
<span id="line3711"></span>led to efforts on the part of the angling majority to counteract, if
<span id="line3712"></span>possible, the growing difficulty. These efforts have been directed
<span id="line3713"></span>chiefly in two ways, one the establishment of fishing clubs, the other
<span id="line3714"></span>the adoption of angling in salt water. The fishing club of the
<span id="line3715"></span>big towns was originally a social institution, and its members met
<span id="line3716"></span>together to sup, converse on angling topics and perhaps to display
<span id="line3717"></span>notable fish that they had caught. Later, however, arose the idea that
<span id="line3718"></span>it would be a convenience if a club could give its members privileges
<span id="line3719"></span>of fishing as well as privileges of reunion. So it comes about that
<span id="line3720"></span>all over the United Kingdom, in British colonies and dependencies, in
<span id="line3721"></span>the United States, and also in Germany and France, fishing clubs rent
<span id="line3722"></span>waters, undertake preservation and restocking and generally lead
<span id="line3723"></span>an active and useful existence. It is a good sign for the future of
<span id="line3724"></span>angling and anglers that they are rapidly increasing in number. One of
<span id="line3725"></span>the oldest fishing clubs, if not the oldest, was the Schuylkill
<span id="line3726"></span>club, founded in Pennsylvania in 1732. An account of its history was
<span id="line3727"></span>published in Philadelphia in 1830. Among the earliest clubs in
<span id="line3728"></span>London are to be numbered such societies as The True Waltonians, The
<span id="line3729"></span>Piscatorial, The Friendly Anglers and The Gresham, which are still
<span id="line3730"></span>flourishing. A certain amount of literary activity has been observable
<span id="line3731"></span>in the world of angling clubs, and several volumes of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>papers<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> are
<span id="line3732"></span>on the records. Most noticeable perhaps are the three volumes of
<span id="line3733"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Anglers' Evenings</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> published in 1880-1894, a collection of
<span id="line3734"></span>essays by members of the Manchester Anglers' Association. The other
<span id="line3735"></span>method of securing a continuance of sport, the adoption of sea-angling
<span id="line3736"></span>as a substitute for fresh-water fishing, is quite a modern thing.
<span id="line3737"></span>Within the memory of men still young the old tactics of hand-line and
<span id="line3738"></span>force were considered good enough for sea fish. Now the fresh-water
<span id="line3739"></span>angler has lent his centuries of experience in deluding his quarry;
<span id="line3740"></span>the sea-angler has adopted many of the ideas presented to him, has
<span id="line3741"></span>modified or improved others, and has developed the capture of sea-fish
<span id="line3742"></span>into a science almost as subtle as the capture of their fresh-water
<span id="line3743"></span>cousins. One more modern feature, which is also a result of the
<span id="line3744"></span>increase of anglers, is the great advance made in fish-culture,
<span id="line3745"></span>fish-stocking and fish-acclimatization during the last half-century.
<span id="line3746"></span>Fish-culture is now a recognized industry; every trout-stream of
<span id="line3747"></span>note and value is restocked from time to time as a matter of course;
<span id="line3748"></span>salmon-hatcheries are numerous, though their practical utility is
<span id="line3749"></span>still a debated matter, in Great Britain at any rate; coarse fish
<span id="line3750"></span>are also bred for purposes of restocking; and, lastly, it is now
<span id="line3751"></span>considered a fairly simple matter to introduce fish from one country
<span id="line3752"></span>to another, and even from continent to continent. In England the
<span id="line3753"></span>movement owes a great deal to Francis Francis, who, though he was not
<span id="line3754"></span>the earliest worker in the field, was among the first to formulate
<span id="line3755"></span>the science of fish-breeding; his book </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Fish-Culture</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, first
<span id="line3756"></span>published in 1863, still remains one of the best treatises on the
<span id="line3757"></span>subject. In the United States, where fishery science has had the
<span id="line3758"></span>benefit of generous governmental and official support and countenance
<span id="line3759"></span>and so has reached a high level of achievement, Dr. T. Garlick (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The
<span id="line3760"></span>Artificial Reproduction of Fishes</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, Cleveland, 1857) is honoured
<span id="line3761"></span>as a pioneer. On the continent of Europe the latter half of the 19th
<span id="line3762"></span>century saw a very considerable and rapid development in fish-culture,
<span id="line3763"></span>but until comparatively recently the propagation and care of fish in
<span id="line3764"></span>most European waters have been considered almost entirely from the
<span id="line3765"></span>point of view of the fish-stew and the market. As to what has been
<span id="line3766"></span>done in the way of acclimatization it is not necessary to say much.
<span id="line3767"></span>Trout (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo fario</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) were introduced to New Zealand in the
<span id="line3768"></span>late 'sixties from England; in the 'eighties rainbow trout (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo
<span id="line3769"></span>irideus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) were also introduced from California; now New Zealand
<span id="line3770"></span>provides the finest trout-fishing of its kind in the world. American
<span id="line3771"></span>trout of different kinds have been introduced into England, and brown
<span id="line3772"></span>trout have been introduced to America; but neither innovation can
<span id="line3773"></span>be said to have been an unqualified success, though the rainbow has
<span id="line3774"></span>established itself firmly in some waters of the United Kingdom. It
<span id="line3775"></span>is still regarded with some suspicion, as it has a tendency to wander
<span id="line3776"></span>from waters which do not altogether suit it. For the rest, trout have
<span id="line3777"></span>been established in Ceylon, in Kashmir and in South Africa, and early
<span id="line3778"></span>in 1906 an attempt was made to carry them to British Central Africa.
<span id="line3779"></span>In fact the possibilities of acclimatization are so great that, it
<span id="line3780"></span>seems probable, in time no river of the civilized world capable of
<span id="line3781"></span>holding trout will be without them.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3784"></span>
<span id="line3785"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Angling now divides itself into two main divisions, fishing in fresh
<span id="line3786"></span>water and fishing in the sea. The two branches of the sport have much
<span id="line3787"></span>in common, and sea-angling is really little more than an adaptation of
<span id="line3788"></span>fresh-water methods to salt-water conditions. Therefore it will not
<span id="line3789"></span>be necessary to deal with it at great length and it naturally comes in
<span id="line3790"></span>the second place. Angling in fresh water is again divisible into three
<span id="line3791"></span>principal parts, fishing on the surface, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>i.e.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> with the fly; in
<span id="line3792"></span>mid-water, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>i.e.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> with a bait simulating the movements of a small
<span id="line3793"></span>fish or with the small fish itself; and on the bottom with worms,
<span id="line3794"></span>paste or one of the many other baits which experience has shown that
<span id="line3795"></span>fish will take. With the premise that it is not intended here to
<span id="line3796"></span>go into the minutiae of instruction which may more profitably be
<span id="line3797"></span>discovered in the many works of reference cited at the end of this
<span id="line3798"></span>article, some account of the subdivisions into which these three
<span id="line3799"></span>styles of fishing fall may be given.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3803"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Fly-fishing</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Fly-fishing is the most modern of them, but it
<span id="line3804"></span>is the most highly esteemed, principally because it is the method par
<span id="line3805"></span>excellence of taking members of the most valuable sporting family of
<span id="line3806"></span>fish, the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmonidae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. It may roughly be considered under three
<span id="line3807"></span>heads, the use of the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>wet<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or sunk fly, of the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dry<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or floating fly,
<span id="line3808"></span>and of the natural insect. Of these the first is the most important,
<span id="line3809"></span>for it covers the widest field and is the most universally practised.
<span id="line3810"></span>There are few varieties of fish which may not either consistently or
<span id="line3811"></span>occasionally be taken with the sunk fly in one of its two forms. The
<span id="line3812"></span>large and gaudy bunch of feathers, silk and tinsel with which salmon,
<span id="line3813"></span>very large trout, black bass and occasionally other predaceous
<span id="line3814"></span>fish are taken is not, strictly speaking, a fly at all. It rather
<span id="line3815"></span>represents, if anything, some small fish or subaqueous creature on
<span id="line3816"></span>which the big fish is accustomed to feed and it may conveniently
<span id="line3817"></span>receive the generic name of salmon-fly. The smaller lures, however,
<span id="line3818"></span>which are used to catch smaller trout and other fish that habitually
<span id="line3819"></span>feed on insect food are in most cases intended to represent that
<span id="line3820"></span>food in one of its forms and are entitled to the name of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>artificial
<span id="line3821"></span>flies.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> The dry or floating fly is simply a development of the
<span id="line3822"></span>imitation theory, and has been evolved from the wet fly in course of
<span id="line3823"></span>closer observation of the habits of flies and fish in certain waters.
<span id="line3824"></span>Both wet and dry fly methods are really a substitute for the third and

<span id="line3826"></span>oldest kind of surface-fishing, the use of a natural
<span id="line3827"></span>insect as a bait. Each method is referred to incidentally below.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3828"></span>
<span id="line3829"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Spinning, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Mid-water fishing, as has been said, broadly
<span id="line3830"></span>consists in the use of a small fish, or something that simulates it,
<span id="line3831"></span>and its devices are aimed almost entirely at those fish which prey
<span id="line3832"></span>on their fellows. Spinning, live-baiting and trolling</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>='<a class="attribute-value">FNanchor_1_58</a>'&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>='<a class="attribute-value" href="view-source:https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13600/13600-h/13600-h.htm#Footnote_1_58">#Footnote_1_58</a>'&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span>[2]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span> are these
<span id="line3833"></span>devices. In the first a small dead fish or an imitation of it made in
<span id="line3834"></span>metal, india-rubber, or other substance, is caused to revolve rapidly
<span id="line3835"></span>as it is pulled through the water, so that it gives the idea of
<span id="line3836"></span>something in difficulties and trying to escape. In the second a small
<span id="line3837"></span>fish is put on the angler's hook alive and conveys the same idea by
<span id="line3838"></span>its own efforts. In the third a small dead fish is caused to dart up
<span id="line3839"></span>and down in the water without revolving; it conveys the same idea as
<span id="line3840"></span>the spinning fish, though the manipulation is different.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3841"></span>
<span id="line3842"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bottom-Fishing</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Bottom-fishing is the branch of angling which
<span id="line3843"></span>is the most general. There is practically no fresh-water fish that
<span id="line3844"></span>will not take some one or more of the baits on the angler's list
<span id="line3845"></span>if they are properly presented to it when it is hungry. Usually
<span id="line3846"></span>the baited hook is on or near the bottom of the water, but the rule
<span id="line3847"></span>suggested by the name <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>bottom-fishing<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is not invariable and often the
<span id="line3848"></span>bait is best used in mid-water; similarly, in <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>mid-water fishing<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line3849"></span>the bait must sometimes be used as close to the bottom as possible.
<span id="line3850"></span>Bottom-fishing is roughly divisible into two kinds, float-fishing, in
<span id="line3851"></span>which a bite is detected by the aid of a float fastened to the line
<span id="line3852"></span>above the hook and so balanced that its tip is visible above the
<span id="line3853"></span>water, and hand-fishing, in which no float is used and the angler
<span id="line3854"></span>trusts to his hand to feel the bite of a fish. In most cases either
<span id="line3855"></span>method can be adopted and it is a matter of taste, but broadly
<span id="line3856"></span>speaking the float-tackle is more suited to water which is not very
<span id="line3857"></span>deep and is either still or not rapid. In great depths or strong
<span id="line3858"></span>streams a float is difficult to manage.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3863"></span>according to the methods which he employs, as most fish can be taken
<span id="line3864"></span>by at least two of these methods, while many of those most highly
<span id="line3865"></span>esteemed can be caught by all three. Sporting fresh-water fish are

<span id="line3872"></span>salar</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), which has a two-fold reputation as a sporting and as
<span id="line3873"></span>a commercial asset. The salmon fisheries of a country are a very
<span id="line3874"></span>valuable possession, but it is only comparatively recently that this
<span id="line3875"></span>has been realized and that salmon rivers have received the legal
<span id="line3876"></span>protection which is necessary to their well-being. Even now it cannot
<span id="line3877"></span>be asserted that in England the salmon question, as it is called,
<span id="line3878"></span>is settled. Partly owing to our ignorance of the life-history of
<span id="line3879"></span>the fish, partly owing to the difficulty of reconciling the opposed
<span id="line3880"></span>interests of commerce and sport, the problem as to how a river should
<span id="line3881"></span>be treated remains only partially solved, though it cannot be denied
<span id="line3882"></span>that there has been a great advance in the right direction. The
<span id="line3883"></span>life-history of the salmon, so far as it concerns the matter in hand,
<span id="line3884"></span>may be very briefly summed up. It is bred in the rivers and fed in the
<span id="line3885"></span>sea. The parent fish ascend in late autumn as high as they can get,
<span id="line3886"></span>the ova are deposited on gravel shallows, hatching out in the course
<span id="line3887"></span>of a few weeks into parr. The infant salmon remains in fresh water at
<span id="line3888"></span>least one year, generally two years, without growing more than a few
<span id="line3889"></span>inches, and then about May assumes what is called the smolt-dress,
<span id="line3890"></span>that is to say, it loses the dark parr-bands and red spots of infancy
<span id="line3891"></span>and becomes silvery all over. After this it descends without delay
<span id="line3892"></span>to the sea, where it feeds to such good purpose that in a year it has
<span id="line3893"></span>reached a weight of 2 lb to 4 lb or more, and it may then reascend
<span id="line3894"></span>as a grilse. Small grilse indeed may only have been in the sea a few
<span id="line3895"></span>months, ascending in the autumn of the year of their first descent. If
<span id="line3896"></span>the fish survives the perils of its first ascent and spawning season
<span id="line3897"></span>and as a kelt or spawned fish gets down to the sea again, it comes up
<span id="line3898"></span>a second time as a salmon of weight varying from 8 lb upwards. Whether
<span id="line3899"></span>salmon come up rivers, and, if so, spawn, every year, why some fish
<span id="line3900"></span>are much heavier than others of the same age, what their mode of life
<span id="line3901"></span>is in the sea, why some run up in spring and summer when the breeding
<span id="line3902"></span>season is not till about November or December, whether they were
<span id="line3903"></span>originally sea-fish or river-fish<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>these and other similar questions
<span id="line3904"></span>await a conclusive answer. One principal fact, however, stands out
<span id="line3905"></span>amid the uncertainty, and that is that without a free passage up and
<span id="line3906"></span>down unpolluted rivers and without protection on the spawning beds
<span id="line3907"></span>salmon have a very poor chance of perpetuating their species. Economic
<span id="line3908"></span>prudence dictates therefore that every year a considerable proportion
<span id="line3909"></span>of running salmon should be allowed to escape the dangers that
<span id="line3910"></span>confront them in the shape of nets, obstructions, pollutions, rods and
<span id="line3911"></span>poachers. And it is in the adjustment of the interests which are bound
<span id="line3912"></span>up in these dangers (the last excepted; officially poachers have no
<span id="line3913"></span>interests, though in practice their plea of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>custom and right<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> has
<span id="line3914"></span>too often to be taken into consideration) that the salmon question
<span id="line3915"></span>consists. To secure a fair proportion of fish for the market, a fair
<span id="line3916"></span>proportion for the rods and a fair proportion for the redds, without
<span id="line3917"></span>unduly damaging manufacturing interests, this is the object of those
<span id="line3918"></span>who have the question at heart, and with many organizations and
<span id="line3919"></span>scientific observers at work it should not be long before the object
<span id="line3920"></span>is attained. Already the system of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>marking<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> kelts with a small silver
<span id="line3921"></span>label has resulted in a considerable array of valuable statistics
<span id="line3922"></span>which have made it possible to estimate the salmon's ordinary rate
<span id="line3923"></span>of growth from year to year. It is very largely due to the efforts of
<span id="line3924"></span>anglers that the matter has gone so far. Whether salmon feed in fresh
<span id="line3925"></span>water is another question of peculiar interest to anglers, for it
<span id="line3926"></span>would seem that if they do not then the whole practice of taking
<span id="line3927"></span>them must be an anomaly. Champions have arisen on both sides of the
<span id="line3928"></span>argument, some, scientists, asserting that salmon (parr and kelts
<span id="line3929"></span>excluded, for both feed greedily as opportunity occurs) do not
<span id="line3930"></span>feed, others, mostly anglers, maintaining strongly that they do, and
<span id="line3931"></span>bringing as evidence their undoubted and customary capture by rod and
<span id="line3932"></span>line, not only with the fly, but also with such obvious food-stuffs as
<span id="line3933"></span>dead baits, worms and prawns. On the other side it is argued that
<span id="line3934"></span>food is never found inside a salmon after it has been long enough in a
<span id="line3935"></span>river to have digested its last meal taken in salt water. The very few
<span id="line3936"></span>instances of food found in salmon which have been brought forward to
<span id="line3937"></span>support the contrary opinion are in the scientific view to be regarded
<span id="line3938"></span>with great caution; certainly in one case of recent years, which at
<span id="line3939"></span>first appeared to be well authenticated, it was afterwards found that
<span id="line3940"></span>a small trout had been pushed down a salmon's throat after capture
<span id="line3941"></span>by way of a joke. A consideration of the question, however, which
<span id="line3942"></span>may perhaps make some appeal to both sides, is put forward by Dr. J.
<span id="line3943"></span>Kingston Barton in the first of the two volumes on </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Fishing</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3944"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Country Life</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> Series). He maintains that salmon do not
<span id="line3945"></span>habitually feed in fresh water, but he does not reject the possibility
<span id="line3946"></span>of their occasionally taking food. His view is that after exertion,
<span id="line3947"></span>such as that entailed by running from pool to pool during a spate, the
<span id="line3948"></span>fish may feel a very transient hunger and be impelled thereby to snap
<span id="line3949"></span>at anything in its vicinity which looks edible. The fact that the
<span id="line3950"></span>angler's best opportunity is undoubtedly when salmon have newly
<span id="line3951"></span>arrived into a pool, supports this contention. The longer they are
<span id="line3952"></span>compelled to remain in the same spot by lack of water the worse
<span id="line3953"></span>becomes the prospect of catching them, and <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>unfishable<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is one of the
<span id="line3954"></span>expressive words which fishermen use to indicate the condition of a
<span id="line3955"></span>river during the long periods of drought which too often distinguish
<span id="line3956"></span>the sport.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line3959"></span>and the long-awaited rain has come that the angler has his chance
<span id="line3960"></span>and makes ready his tackle, against the period of a few days (on some
<span id="line3961"></span>short streams only a few hours) during which the water will be right;

<span id="line3963"></span>that the colour of the water is suitable to the fly, but that its
<span id="line3964"></span>height shall be within an inch or two of a given mark, prescribed by
<span id="line3965"></span>experience. As to the tackle which is made ready,
<span id="line3966"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0026</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0026</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0026]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line3967"></span>there is, as in most angling matters, divergence of
<span id="line3968"></span>opinion. Salmon fly-rods are now made principally of two materials,
<span id="line3969"></span>greenheart and split-cane; the former is less expensive, the latter is
<span id="line3970"></span>more durable; it is entirely a matter of taste which a man uses,
<span id="line3971"></span>but the split-cane rod is now rather more in favour, and for
<span id="line3972"></span>salmon-fishing it is in England usually built with a core of steel
<span id="line3973"></span>running from butt to tip and known as a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>steel centre.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> How long the
<span id="line3974"></span>rod shall be is also a matter on which anglers differ, but from 16
<span id="line3975"></span>ft. to 17 ft. 6 in. represents the limits within which most rods
<span id="line3976"></span>are preferred. The tendency is to reduce rather than to increase the
<span id="line3977"></span>length of the rod, which may be accounted for by the adoption of a
<span id="line3978"></span>heavy line. Early in the 19th century anglers used light-topped rods
<span id="line3979"></span>of 20 ft. and even more, and with them a light line composed partly of
<span id="line3980"></span>horse-hair; they thought 60 ft. with such material a good cast. Modern
<span id="line3981"></span>experience, however, has shown that a shorter rod with a heavier top
<span id="line3982"></span>will throw a heavy dressed silk line much farther with less exertion.
<span id="line3983"></span>Ninety feet is now considered a good fishing cast, while many men can
<span id="line3984"></span>throw a great deal more. In the United States, where rods have long
<span id="line3985"></span>been used much lighter than in England, the limits suggested would be
<span id="line3986"></span>considered too high. From 12 ft. 6 in. to 15 ft. 6 in. is about
<span id="line3987"></span>the range of the American angler's choice, though long rods are not
<span id="line3988"></span>unknown with him.

<span id="line3989"></span>and other forms of tackle which is now presented to the angler's
<span id="line3990"></span>consideration and for his bewilderment is too wide a subject to be
<span id="line3991"></span>touched upon here. Something, however, falls to be said about flies.
<span id="line3992"></span>One of the perennially fruitful topics of inquiry is what the fish
<span id="line3993"></span>takes a salmon-fly to be. Beyond a fairly general admission that it
<span id="line3994"></span>is regarded as something endowed with life, perhaps resembling a
<span id="line3995"></span>remembered article of marine diet, perhaps inviting gastronomic
<span id="line3996"></span>experiment, perhaps irritating merely and rousing an impulse to
<span id="line3997"></span>destroy, the discussion has not reached any definite conclusion. But
<span id="line3998"></span>more or less connected with it is the controversy as to variety of
<span id="line3999"></span>colour and pattern. Some authorities hold that a great variety of
<span id="line4000"></span>patterns with very minute differences in colour and shades of colour
<span id="line4001"></span>is essential to complete success; others contend that salmon do not
<span id="line4002"></span>differentiate between nice shades of colour, that they only draw
<span id="line4003"></span>distinctions between flies broadly as being light, medium or dark in
<span id="line4004"></span>general appearance, and that the size of a fly rather than its colour
<span id="line4005"></span>is the important point for the angler's consideration. Others again
<span id="line4006"></span>go some way with the supporters of the colour-scheme and admit the
<span id="line4007"></span>efficacy of flies whose general character is red, or yellow, or black,
<span id="line4008"></span>and so on. The opinion of the majority, however, is probably based on
<span id="line4009"></span>past experience, and a man's favourite flies for different rivers
<span id="line4010"></span>and condition of water are those with which he or someone else has
<span id="line4011"></span>previously succeeded. It remains a fact that in most fly-books great
<span id="line4012"></span>variety of patterns will be discoverable, while certain old standard
<span id="line4013"></span>favourites such as the Jock Scott, Durham Ranger, Silver Doctor, and
<span id="line4014"></span>Thunder and Lightning will be prominent. Coming out of the region of
<span id="line4015"></span>controversy it is a safe generalization to say that the general rule
<span id="line4016"></span>is: big flies for spring fishing when rivers are probably high, small
<span id="line4017"></span>flies for summer and low water, and flies medium or small in autumn
<span id="line4018"></span>according to the conditions. Spring fishing is considered the cream of
<span id="line4019"></span>the sport. Though salmon are not as a rule so numerous or so heavy as
<span id="line4020"></span>during the autumn run, and though kelts are often a nuisance in the
<span id="line4021"></span>early months, yet the clean-run fish of February, March or April amply
<span id="line4022"></span>repays patience and disappointment by its fighting powers and its
<span id="line4023"></span>beauty. Summer fishing on most rivers in the British Islands is
<span id="line4024"></span>uncertain, but in Norway summer is the season, which possibly explains
<span id="line4025"></span>to some extent the popularity of that country with British anglers,
<span id="line4026"></span>for the pleasure of a sport is largely increased by good weather.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line4027"></span>
<span id="line4028"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Two methods of using the fly are in vogue, casting and harling. The
<span id="line4029"></span>first is by far the more artistic, and it may be practised either from
<span id="line4030"></span>a boat, from the bank or from the bed of the river itself; in the last
<span id="line4031"></span>case the angler wades, wearing waterproof trousers or wading-stockings
<span id="line4032"></span>and stout nail-studded brogues. In either case the fishing is similar.
<span id="line4033"></span>The fly is cast across and down stream, and has to be brought over the
<span id="line4034"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>lie<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> of the fish, swimming naturally with its head to the stream,
<span id="line4035"></span>its feathers working with tempting movement and its whole appearance
<span id="line4036"></span>suggesting some live thing dropping gradually down and across stream.
<span id="line4037"></span>Most anglers add to the motion of the fly by <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>working<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> it with short
<span id="line4038"></span>pulls from the rod-top. When a fish takes, the rise is sometimes seen,
<span id="line4039"></span>sometimes not; in any case the angler should not respond with the rod
<span id="line4040"></span>until he </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>feels</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> the pull. Then he should </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>tighten</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, not
<span id="line4041"></span>strike. The fatal word <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>strike,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with its too literal interpretation,
<span id="line4042"></span>has caused many a breakage. Having hooked his fish, the angler must
<span id="line4043"></span>be guided by circumstances as to what he does; the salmon will usually
<span id="line4044"></span>decide that for him. But it is a sound rule to give a well-hooked fish
<span id="line4045"></span>no unnecessary advantage and to hold on as hard as the tackle will
<span id="line4046"></span>allow. Good tackle will stand an immense strain, and with this <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>a
<span id="line4047"></span>minute a pound<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is a fair estimate of the time in which a fish should
<span id="line4048"></span>be landed. A foul-hooked salmon (no uncommon thing, for a fish not
<span id="line4049"></span>infrequently misses the fly and gets hooked somewhere in the body)
<span id="line4050"></span>takes much longer to land. The other method of using the fly, harling,
<span id="line4051"></span>which is practised on a few big rivers, consists in trailing the
<span id="line4052"></span>fly behind a boat rowed backward and forwards across the stream and
<span id="line4053"></span>dropping gradually downwards. Fly-fishing for salmon is also practised
<span id="line4054"></span>on some lakes, into which the fish run. On lakes the boat drifts
<span id="line4055"></span>slowly along a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>beat,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> while the angler casts diagonally over the
<span id="line4056"></span>spots where salmon are wont to lie. Salmon may also be caught by
<span id="line4057"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>mid-water fishing,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with a natural bait either spun or trolled
<span id="line4058"></span>and with artificial spinning-baits of different kinds, and by
<span id="line4059"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>bottom-fishing<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with prawns, shrimps and worms. Spinning is usually
<span id="line4060"></span>practised when the water is too high or too coloured for the fly;
<span id="line4061"></span>trolling is seldom employed, but is useful for exploring pools which
<span id="line4062"></span>cannot be fished by spinning or with the fly; the prawn is a valuable
<span id="line4063"></span>lure in low water and when fish are unwilling to rise; while the worm
<span id="line4064"></span>is killing at all states of the river, but except as a last resource
<span id="line4065"></span>is not much in favour. There are a few waters where salmon have the
<span id="line4066"></span>reputation of not taking a fly at all; in them spinning or prawning
<span id="line4067"></span>are the usual modes of fishing. But most anglers, wherever possible,
<span id="line4068"></span>prefer to use the fly. The rod for the alternative methods is
<span id="line4069"></span>generally shorter and stiffer than the fly-rod, though made of like
<span id="line4070"></span>material. Twelve to fourteen feet represents about the range of
<span id="line4071"></span>choice. Outside the British Islands the salmon-fisher finds the
<span id="line4072"></span>headquarters of his sport in Europe in Scandinavia and Iceland, and in
<span id="line4073"></span>the New World in some of the waters of Canada and Newfoundland.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4092"></span>sockeye, humpback, cohoe, dog-salmon and masu, are smaller and of
<span id="line4093"></span>less interest to the angler, though some of them have great commercial
<span id="line4094"></span>value. The last-named is only found in the waters of Japan, but the
<span id="line4095"></span>rest occur in greater or less quantities in the rivers of Kamchatka,
<span id="line4096"></span>Alaska, British Columbia and Oregon. The problems presented to science
<span id="line4097"></span>by solar are offered by </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Oncorhynchus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> also, but there are
<span id="line4098"></span>variations in his life-history, such as the fact that few if any fish
<span id="line4099"></span>of the genus are supposed to survive their first spawning season. When
<span id="line4100"></span>once in the rivers none of these salmon is of very much use to the
<span id="line4101"></span>angler; as, though it is stated that they will occasionally take a fly
<span id="line4102"></span>or spoon in fresh water, they are not nearly so responsive as their
<span id="line4103"></span>Atlantic cousin and in many streams are undoubtedly not worth trying
<span id="line4104"></span>for. At the mouths of some rivers, however, where the water is
<span id="line4105"></span>distinctly tidal, and in certain bays of the sea itself they give very
<span id="line4106"></span>fine sport, the method of fishing for them being usually to trail a
<span id="line4107"></span>heavy spoonbait behind a boat. By this means remarkable bags of fish
<span id="line4108"></span>have been made by anglers. The sport is of quite recent development.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4111"></span>migratory salmonid of Europe. This is a fish with many local names and
<span id="line4112"></span>a good deal of local variation. Modern science, however, recognises
<span id="line4113"></span>two <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>races<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> only, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo trutta</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the sea-trout proper, and
<span id="line4114"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo cambricus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>eriox</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the bull-trout, or sewin of
<span id="line4115"></span>Wales, which is most prominent in such rivers as the Coquet and Tweed.
<span id="line4116"></span>The life-history of sea-trout is much the same as that of salmon, and
<span id="line4117"></span>the fish on their first return from the sea in the grilse-stage are
<span id="line4118"></span>called by many names, finnock, herling and whitling being perhaps the
<span id="line4119"></span>best known. Of the two races </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo trutta</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> alone is of much use
<span id="line4120"></span>to the fly-fisher. The bull-trout, for some obscure reason, is not at
<span id="line4121"></span>all responsive to his efforts, except in its kelt stage. Then it will
<span id="line4122"></span>take greedily enough, but that is small consolation. The bull-trout
<span id="line4123"></span>is a strong fish and grows to a great size and it is a pity that it
<span id="line4124"></span>is not of greater sporting value, if only to make up for its bad
<span id="line4125"></span>reputation as an article of food. Some amends, however, are made by
<span id="line4126"></span>its cousin the sea-trout, which is one of the gamest and daintiest
<span id="line4127"></span>fish on the angler's list. It is found in most salmon rivers and also
<span id="line4128"></span>in not a few streams which are too small to harbour the bigger fish,
<span id="line4129"></span>while there are many lakes in Scotland and Ireland (where the fish
<span id="line4130"></span>is usually known as white trout) where the fishing is superb when the
<span id="line4131"></span>trout have run up into them. Fly-fishing for sea-trout is not a thing
<span id="line4132"></span>apart. A three-pounder that will impale itself on a big salmon-fly,
<span id="line4133"></span>might equally well have taken a tiny trout-fly. Many anglers, when
<span id="line4134"></span>fishing a sea-trout river where they run large, 5 lb or more, and
<span id="line4135"></span>where there is also a chance of a salmon, effect a compromise by using
<span id="line4136"></span>a light 13 ft. or 14 ft. double-handed rod, and tackle not so slender
<span id="line4137"></span>as to make hooking a salmon a certain disaster. But undoubtedly to get
<span id="line4138"></span>the full pleasure out of sea-trout-fishing a single-handed rod of 10
<span id="line4139"></span>ft. to 12 ft. with reasonably fine gut and small flies should be used,
<span id="line4140"></span>and the way of using it is much the same as in wet-fly fishing for
<span id="line4141"></span>brown trout, which will be treated later. When the double-handed rod
<span id="line4142"></span>and small salmon-flies are used, the fishing is practically the same
<span id="line4143"></span>as salmon-fishing except that it is on a somewhat smaller scale. Flies
<span id="line4144"></span>for sea-trout are numberless and local patterns abound, as may be
<span id="line4145"></span>expected with a fish which has so catholic a taste. But, as with
<span id="line4146"></span>salmon-fishers so with sea-trout-fishers, experience forms belief and
<span id="line4147"></span>success governs selection. Among the small salmon-flies and loch-flies
<span id="line4148"></span>which will fill his book, the angler will do well to have a store of
<span id="line4149"></span>very small trout-flies at hand, while experience has shown that even
<span id="line4150"></span>the dry fly will kill sea-trout on occasion, a thing that is worth
<span id="line4151"></span>remembering where rivers are low and fish shy. July, August and
<span id="line4152"></span>September are in general the best months for sea-trout, and as they
<span id="line4153"></span>are dry months the angler often has to put up with indifferent sport.
<span id="line4154"></span>The fish will, however, rise in tidal water and in a few localities
<span id="line4155"></span>even in the sea itself, or in salt-water lochs into which streams run.
<span id="line4156"></span>Sea-trout have an irritating knack of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>coming short,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> that is to
<span id="line4157"></span>say, they will pluck at the fly without really taking it. There are
<span id="line4158"></span>occasions, on the other hand, in loch-fishing where plenty of time
<span id="line4159"></span>must be given to the fish without tightening on it, especially if it
<span id="line4160"></span>happens to be a big one. Like salmon, sea-trout are to be caught with
<span id="line4161"></span>spinning-baits and also with the worm. The main controversy that is
<span id="line4162"></span>concerned with sea-trout is whether or no the fish captured in early
<span id="line4163"></span>spring are clean fish or well-mended kelts. On the whole, as sea-trout
<span id="line4164"></span>seldom run before May, the majority of opinion inclines to their being
<span id="line4165"></span>kelts.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4171"></span>while other transatlantic species both of trout and char (which are
<span id="line4172"></span>some of them partially migratory, that is to say, migratory when
<span id="line4173"></span>occasion offers), such as the steelhead (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>S. rivularis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>),

<span id="line4175"></span>clarkii</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), are at least not unknown. All these fish, together with
<span id="line4176"></span>their allied forms in America, can be captured with the fly, and,
<span id="line4177"></span>speaking broadly, the wet-fly method will do well for them all.
<span id="line4178"></span>Therefore it is only necessary to deal with the methods applicable to

<span id="line4182"></span>for it is spread over the whole of Great Britain and most of Europe,
<span id="line4183"></span>wherever there are waters suited to it. It is a fine sporting fish and
<span id="line4184"></span>is excellent for the table, while in some streams and lakes it grows
<span id="line4185"></span>to a very considerable size, examples of 16 lb from southern rivers
<span id="line4186"></span>and 20 lb from Irish and Scottish lakes being not unknown. One of the
<span id="line4187"></span>signs of its popularity is that its habits and history have produced
<span id="line4188"></span>some very animated controversies. Some of the earliest discussions
<span id="line4189"></span>were provoked by the liability of the fish to change its appearance
<span id="line4190"></span>in different surroundings and conditions, and so at one time many a
<span id="line4191"></span>district claimed its local trout as a separate species. Now, however,
<span id="line4192"></span>science admits but one species, though, to such well-defined varieties
<span id="line4193"></span>as the Loch Leven trout, the estuarine trout and the gillaroo, it
<span id="line4194"></span>concedes the right to separate names and <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>races.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> In effect all, from

<span id="line4200"></span>into three kinds: fishing with the artificial fly sunk or <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>wet,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line4201"></span>fishing with it floating or <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dry<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and fishing with the natural insect.
<span id="line4202"></span>Of the two first methods the wet fly is the older and may be taken
<span id="line4203"></span>first. Time was when all good anglers cast their flies downstream and
<span id="line4204"></span>thought no harm. But in 1857 W. C. Stewart published his </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Practical
<span id="line4205"></span>Angler</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, in which he taught that it paid better to fish up-stream,
<span id="line4206"></span>for by so doing the angler was not only less likely to be seen by
<span id="line4207"></span>the trout but was more likely to hook his fish. The doctrine was much
<span id="line4208"></span>discussed and criticized, but it gradually won adherents, until now
<span id="line4209"></span>up-stream fishing is the orthodox method where it is possible. Stewart
<span id="line4210"></span>was also one of the first to advocate a lighter rod in place of the
<span id="line4211"></span>heavy 12 ft. and 13 ft. weapons that were used in the North in his
<span id="line4212"></span>time. There are still many men who use the long rod for wet-fly
<span id="line4213"></span>fishing in streams, but there are now more who find 10 ft. quite
<span id="line4214"></span>enough for their purpose. For lake-fishing from a boat, however, the
<span id="line4215"></span>longer rod is still in many cases preferred. In fishing rivers the
<span id="line4216"></span>main art is to place the right flies in the right places and to let
<span id="line4217"></span>them come naturally down with the stream. The right flies may be
<span id="line4218"></span>ascertained to some extent from books and from local wisdom, but the
<span id="line4219"></span>right places can only be learnt by experience. It does not, however,
<span id="line4220"></span>take long to acquire <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>an eye for water<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and that is half the battle,
<span id="line4221"></span>for the haunts of trout in rapid rivers are very much alike. In
<span id="line4222"></span>lake-fishing chance has a greater share in bringing about success, but
<span id="line4223"></span>here too the right fly and the right place are important; the actual
<span id="line4224"></span>management of rod, line and flies, of course, is easier, for there is
<span id="line4225"></span>no stream to be reckoned with. Though there is little left to be said
<span id="line4226"></span>about wet-fly fishing where the fly is an imitation more or less exact
<span id="line4227"></span>of a natural insect, there is another branch of the art which has been
<span id="line4228"></span>stimulated by modern developments. This is the use of salmon-flies for
<span id="line4229"></span>big trout much in the same way as for salmon. In such rivers as the
<span id="line4230"></span>Thames, where the trout are cannibals and run very large, ordinary
<span id="line4231"></span>trout-flies are of little use, and the fly-fisher's only
<span id="line4232"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0028</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0028</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0028]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line4233"></span>chance is to use a big fly and <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>work<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> it, casting across
<span id="line4234"></span>and down stream. The big fly has also been found serviceable with the
<span id="line4235"></span>great fish of New Zealand and with the inhabitants of such a piece of
<span id="line4236"></span>water as Blagdon Lake near Bristol, where the trout run very large.
<span id="line4237"></span>For this kind of fishing much stronger tackle and a heavier rod are
<span id="line4238"></span>required than for catching fish that seldom exceed the pound.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line4239"></span>
<span id="line4240"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Dry Fly</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Fishing with the floating fly is a device of southern
<span id="line4241"></span>origin, and the idea no doubt arose from the facts that on the placid
<span id="line4242"></span>south country streams the natural fly floats on the surface and that
<span id="line4243"></span>the trout are accustomed to feed on it there. The controversy <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dry
<span id="line4244"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>versus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> wet<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> was long and spirited, but the new idea won the day
<span id="line4245"></span>and now not only on the chalk-streams, but on such stretches of even
<span id="line4246"></span>Highland rivers as are suitable, the dry-fly man may be seen testing
<span id="line4247"></span>his theories. These theories are simple and consist in placing before
<span id="line4248"></span>the fish an exact imitation of the insect on which it is feeding, in
<span id="line4249"></span>such a way that it shall float down exactly as if it were an insect
<span id="line4250"></span>of the same kind. To this end special tackle and special methods have
<span id="line4251"></span>been found necessary. Not only the fly but also the line has to float
<span id="line4252"></span>on the wafer; the line is very heavy and therefore the rod (split-cane
<span id="line4253"></span>or greenheart) must be stiff and powerful; special precautions have
<span id="line4254"></span>to be taken that the fly shall float unhindered and shall not <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>drag<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>;
<span id="line4255"></span>special casts have to be made to counteract awkward winds; and,
<span id="line4256"></span>lastly, the matching of the fly with the insect on the water is a
<span id="line4257"></span>matter of much nicety, for the water-flies are of many shades and
<span id="line4258"></span>colours. Many brains have busied themselves with the solution of these
<span id="line4259"></span>problems with such success that dry-fly fishing is now a finished art.
<span id="line4260"></span>The entomology of the dry-fly stream has been studied very deeply by
<span id="line4261"></span>Mr. F. M. Halford, the late G. S. Marryat and others, and improvements
<span id="line4262"></span>both in flies and tackle have been very great. Quite lately, however,
<span id="line4263"></span>there has been a movement in favour of light rods for dry-fly fishing
<span id="line4264"></span>as well as wet-fly fishing. The English split-cane rod for dry-fly
<span id="line4265"></span>work weighs about an ounce to the foot, rather more or rather
<span id="line4266"></span>less. The American rod of similar action and material weighs much
<span id="line4267"></span>less<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>approximately 6 oz. to 10 ft. The light rod, it is urged, is
<span id="line4268"></span>much less tiring and is quite powerful enough for ordinary purposes.
<span id="line4269"></span>Against it is claimed that dry-fly fishing is not <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>ordinary purposes,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line4270"></span>that chalk-stream weeds are too strong and chalk-stream winds too wild
<span id="line4271"></span>for the light rod to be efficient against them. However, the light rod
<span id="line4272"></span>is growing in popular favour; British manufacturers are building rods
<span id="line4273"></span>after the American style; and anglers are taking to them more and
<span id="line4274"></span>more. The dry-fly method is now practised by many fishermen both in
<span id="line4275"></span>Germany and France, but it has scarcely found a footing as yet in the
<span id="line4276"></span>United States or Canada.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4285"></span>stout-wired hook) is carried out by the breeze and just allowed to
<span id="line4286"></span>touch the water. When a trout rises it is well to count <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>ten<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> before
<span id="line4287"></span>striking. Very heavy trout are caught in this manner during the mayfly
<span id="line4288"></span>season. In the North <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>creeper-fishing<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> is akin to this method, but
<span id="line4289"></span>the creeper is the larva of the stone-fly, not a fly itself, and it
<span id="line4290"></span>is cast more like an ordinary fly and allowed to sink. Sometimes,
<span id="line4291"></span>however, the mature insect is used with equally good results. A few
<span id="line4292"></span>anglers still practise the old style of dapping or <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>dibbling<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> after
<span id="line4293"></span>the manner advised by Izaak Walton. It is a deadly way of fishing
<span id="line4294"></span>small overgrown brooks. A stiff rod and strong gut are necessary, and
<span id="line4295"></span>a grasshopper or almost any large fly will serve for bait.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4298"></span>employed are spinning, live-baiting and worming. For big river trout
<span id="line4299"></span>such as those of the Thames a gudgeon or bleak makes the best spinning
<span id="line4300"></span>or live bait, for great lake trout (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Jerox</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) a small fish of
<span id="line4301"></span>their own species and for smaller trout a minnow. There are numberless
<span id="line4302"></span>artificial spinning-baits which kill well at times, the Devon being
<span id="line4303"></span>perhaps the favourite. The use of the drop-minnow, which is trolling
<span id="line4304"></span>on a lesser scale, is a killing method employed more in the north of
<span id="line4305"></span>England than elsewhere. The worm is mostly deadly in thick water, so
<span id="line4306"></span>deadly that it is looked on askance. But there is a highly artistic
<span id="line4307"></span>mode of fishing known as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>clear-water worming.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> This is most
<span id="line4308"></span>successful when rivers are low and weather hot, and it needs an expert
<span id="line4309"></span>angler to succeed in it. The worm has to be cast up-stream rather like
<span id="line4310"></span>a fly, and the method is little inferior to fly-fishing in delicacy
<span id="line4311"></span>and difficulty. The other baits for trout, or rather the other baits
<span id="line4312"></span>which they will take sometimes, are legion. Wasp-grubs, maggots,
<span id="line4313"></span>caterpillars, small frogs, bread, there is very little the fish will
<span id="line4314"></span>not take. But except in rural districts little effort is made to catch
<span id="line4315"></span>trout by means less orthodox than the fly, minnow and worm, and the
<span id="line4316"></span>tendency nowadays both in England and America is to restrict anglers
<span id="line4317"></span>where possible to the use of the artificial fly only.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4320"></span>England which gives much sport to the fly-fisher is the grayling, a
<span id="line4321"></span>fish which possesses the recommendation of rising well in winter. It
<span id="line4322"></span>can be caught with either wet or dry fly, and with the same tackle
<span id="line4323"></span>as trout, which generally inhabit the same stream. Grayling will
<span id="line4324"></span>take most small trout-flies, but there are many patterns of fly tied
<span id="line4325"></span>specially for them, most of them founded on the red tag or the green
<span id="line4326"></span>insect. Worms and maggots are also largely used in some waters
<span id="line4327"></span>for grayling, and there is a curious contrivance known as the
<span id="line4328"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>grasshopper,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> which is a sort of compromise between the fly and
<span id="line4329"></span>bait. It consists of a leaded hook round the shank of which is twisted
<span id="line4330"></span>bright-coloured wool. The point is tipped with maggots, and the lure,
<span id="line4331"></span>half artificial, half natural, is dropped into deep holes and worked
<span id="line4332"></span>up and down in the water. In some places the method is very killing.
<span id="line4333"></span>The grayling has been very prominent of late years owing to the
<span id="line4334"></span>controversy <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>grayling </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>versus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> trout.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> Many people hold that
<span id="line4335"></span>grayling injure a trout stream by devouring trout-ova and trout-food,
<span id="line4336"></span>by increasing too rapidly and in other ways. Beyond, however, proving
<span id="line4337"></span>the self-evident fact that a stream can only support a given amount
<span id="line4338"></span>of fish-life, the grayling's opponents do not seem to have made out
<span id="line4339"></span>a very good case, for no real evidence of its injuring trout has been
<span id="line4340"></span>adduced.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4343"></span>widely distributed over the world, but in Great Britain are not
<span id="line4344"></span>very important to the angler. One well-defined species (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Sahelinus
<span id="line4345"></span>alpinus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is found in some lakes of Wales and Scotland, but
<span id="line4346"></span>principally in Westmorland and Cumberland. It sometimes takes a small
<span id="line4347"></span>fly but is more often caught with small artificial spinning-baits. The
<span id="line4348"></span>fish seldom exceeds 1 lb in Great Britain, though in Scandinavia
<span id="line4349"></span>it is caught up to 5 lb or more. There are some important chars
<span id="line4350"></span>in America, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>fontinalis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> being one of the most esteemed. Some
<span id="line4351"></span>members of the genus occasionally attain a size scarcely excelled
<span id="line4352"></span>by the salmon. Among them are the Great Lake trout of America,
<span id="line4353"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cristinomer namaycush</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, and the Danubian <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>salmon<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or huchen,
<span id="line4354"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmo hucho</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. Both of these fish are caught principally with
<span id="line4355"></span>spinning-baits, but both will on occasion take a salmon-fly, though
<span id="line4356"></span>not with any freedom after they have reached a certain size. An
<span id="line4357"></span>attempt has been made to introduce huchen into the Thames but at the
<span id="line4358"></span>time of writing the result cannot yet be estimated.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4360"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Pike</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>The pike (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Esox lucius</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), which after the
<span id="line4361"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Salmonidae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> is the most valued sporting fish in Great Britain,
<span id="line4362"></span>is a fish of prey pure and simple. Though it will occasionally take a
<span id="line4363"></span>large fly, a worm or other ground-bait, its systematic capture is only
<span id="line4364"></span>essayed with small fish or artificial spinning-baits. A live bait is
<span id="line4365"></span>supposed to be the most deadly lure for big pike, probably because it
<span id="line4366"></span>is the method employed by most anglers. But spinning is more artistic
<span id="line4367"></span>and has been found quite successful enough by those who give it a fair
<span id="line4368"></span>and full trial. Trolling, the method of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>sink and draw<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> with a dead
<span id="line4369"></span>bait, referred to previously in this article, is not much practised
<span id="line4370"></span>nowadays, though at one time it was very popular. It was given up
<span id="line4371"></span>because the traditional form of trolling-tackle was such that the bait
<span id="line4372"></span>had to be swallowed by the pike before the hook would take hold, and
<span id="line4373"></span>that necessitated killing all fish caught, whether large or small. The
<span id="line4374"></span>same objection formerly applied to
<span id="line4375"></span>live-baiting with what was known as a gorge-hook. Now,
<span id="line4376"></span>however, what is called snap-tackle is almost invariably used in
<span id="line4377"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0029</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0029</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0029]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line4378"></span>live-baiting, and the system is by some few anglers extended to the
<span id="line4379"></span>other method too. Pike are autumn and winter fish and are at their
<span id="line4380"></span>best in December. They grow to a very considerable size, fish of 20
<span id="line4381"></span>lb being regarded as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>specimens<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and an occasional thirty-pounder
<span id="line4382"></span>rewarding the zealous and fortunate. The heaviest pike caught with a
<span id="line4383"></span>rod in recent years which is sufficiently authenticated, weighed 37
<span id="line4384"></span>lb, but heavier specimens are said to have been taken in Irish lakes.
<span id="line4385"></span>River pike up to about 10 lb in weight are excellent eating.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line4386"></span>
<span id="line4387"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>America has several species of pike, of which the muskelunge of the
<span id="line4388"></span>great lake region (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Esox masquinongy</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is the most important.
<span id="line4389"></span>It is a very fine fish, excelling </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Esox lucius</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> both in size and
<span id="line4390"></span>looks. From the angler's point of view it may be considered simply
<span id="line4391"></span>as a large pike and may be caught by similar methods. It occasionally
<span id="line4392"></span>reaches the weight of 80 lb or perhaps more. The pickerel (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Esox
<span id="line4393"></span>reticulatus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is the only other of the American pikes which gives
<span id="line4394"></span>any sport. It reaches a respectable size, but is as inferior to the
<span id="line4395"></span>pike as the pike is to the muskelunge.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4398"></span>fishes. The European perch (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Perca fluviatilis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) has a place by
<span id="line4399"></span>itself in the affections of anglers. When young it is easy to catch by
<span id="line4400"></span>almost any method of fishing, and a large number of Walton's disciples
<span id="line4401"></span>have been initiated into the art with its help. Worms and small
<span id="line4402"></span>live-baits are the principal lures, but at times the fish will take
<span id="line4403"></span>small bright artificial spinning-baits well, and odd attractions such
<span id="line4404"></span>as boiled shrimps, caddis-grubs, small frogs, maggots, wasp-grubs, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c.
<span id="line4405"></span>are sometimes successful. The drop-minnow is one of the best methods
<span id="line4406"></span>of taking perch. Very occasionally, and principally in shallow pools,
<span id="line4407"></span>the fish will take an artificial fly greedily, a small salmon-fly
<span id="line4408"></span>being the best thing to use in such a case. A perch of 2 lb is a
<span id="line4409"></span>good fish, and a specimen of 4<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>frac12;</span> lb about the limit of angling
<span id="line4410"></span>expectation. There have been rare instances of perch over 5 lb,
<span id="line4411"></span>and there are legends of eight-pounders, which, however, need
<span id="line4412"></span>authentication.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4415"></span>flavescens</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is very much like its European cousin in appearance
<span id="line4416"></span>and habits, but it is not so highly esteemed by American anglers,
<span id="line4417"></span>because they are fortunate in being possessed of a better fish in the
<span id="line4418"></span>black bass, another member of the perch family. There are two kinds
<span id="line4419"></span>of black bass (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Micropterus salmoides</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Micropterus
<span id="line4420"></span>dolomieu</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), the large-mouthed and the small-mouthed. The first is
<span id="line4421"></span>more a lake and pond fish than the second, and they are seldom found
<span id="line4422"></span>in the same waters. As the black bass is a fly-taking fish and a
<span id="line4423"></span>strong fighter, it is as valuable to the angler as a trout and is
<span id="line4424"></span>highly esteemed. Bass-flies are </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>sui generis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, but incline more
<span id="line4425"></span>to the nature of salmon-flies than trout-flies. An artificial frog
<span id="line4426"></span>cast with a fly-rod or very light spinning-rod is also a favourite
<span id="line4427"></span>lure. For the rest the fish will take almost anything in the nature of
<span id="line4428"></span>worms or small fish, like its cousin the perch. A 4 lb bass is a good
<span id="line4429"></span>fish, but five-pounders are not uncommon. Black bass have to some
<span id="line4430"></span>extent been acclimatized in France.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4433"></span>fish common in the Thames and many other slow-flowing English rivers.
<span id="line4434"></span>It is very like the perch in shape but lacks the dusky bars which
<span id="line4435"></span>distinguish the other, and is spotted with dark brown spots on a
<span id="line4436"></span>golden olive background. It is not of much use to the angler as it
<span id="line4437"></span>seldom exceeds 3 oz. in weight. It takes small worms, maggots and
<span id="line4438"></span>similar baits greedily, and is often a nuisance when the angler is
<span id="line4439"></span>expecting better fish. Allied to the perches is the pike-perch,
<span id="line4440"></span>of which two species are of some importance to the angler, one the
<span id="line4441"></span>wall-eye of eastern America (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Stizostedion vitreum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and the
<span id="line4442"></span>other the zander of Central Europe (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Sandrus lucioperca</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>). The
<span id="line4443"></span>last especially is a fine fighter, occasionally reaching a weight of
<span id="line4444"></span>20 lb. It is usually caught by spinning, but will take live-baits,
<span id="line4445"></span>worms and other things of that nature. The Danube may be described as
<span id="line4446"></span>its headquarters. It is a fish whose sporting importance will be more
<span id="line4447"></span>realized as anglers on the continent become more numerous.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4450"></span>and its members constitute the majority of English sporting fishes.
<span id="line4451"></span>In America the various kinds of chub, sucker, dace, shiner, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. are
<span id="line4452"></span>little esteemed and are regarded as spoils for the youthful angler
<span id="line4453"></span>only, or as baits for the better fish in which the continent is so
<span id="line4454"></span>rich. In England, however, the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cyprinidae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> have an honoured

<span id="line4456"></span>Europe some of them have a commercial value as food-fishes. In India
<span id="line4457"></span>at least one member of the family, the mahseer, takes rank with the
<span id="line4458"></span>salmon as a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>big game<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> fish.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4460"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Carp, Tench, Barbel, Bream</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>The family as represented in
<span id="line4461"></span>England may be roughly divided into two groups, those which feed on
<span id="line4462"></span>the bottom purely and those which occasionally take flies. The first
<span id="line4463"></span>consists of carp, tench, barbel and bream. Of these carp, tench and
<span id="line4464"></span>bream are either river or pool fish, while the barbel is found only in
<span id="line4465"></span>rivers, principally in the Thames and Trent. The carp grows to a great
<span id="line4466"></span>size, 20 lb being not unknown; tench are big at 5 lb; barbel have been
<span id="line4467"></span>caught up to 14 lb or rather more; and bream occasionally reach 8 lb,
<span id="line4468"></span>while a fish of over 11 lb is on record. All these fish are capricious
<span id="line4469"></span>feeders, carp and barbel being particularly undependable. In some
<span id="line4470"></span>waters it seems to be impossible to catch the large specimens, and the
<span id="line4471"></span>angler who seeks to gain trophies in either branch of the sport needs
<span id="line4472"></span>both patience and perseverance. Tench and bream are not quite so
<span id="line4473"></span>difficult. The one fish can sometimes be caught in great quantities,
<span id="line4474"></span>and the other is generally to be enticed by the man who knows how to
<span id="line4475"></span>set about it. Two main principles have to be observed in attacking all
<span id="line4476"></span>these fish, ground-baiting and early rising. Ground-baiting consists
<span id="line4477"></span>in casting food into the water so as to attract the fish to a certain
<span id="line4478"></span>spot and to induce them to feed. Without it very little can be done
<span id="line4479"></span>with shy and large fish of these species. Early rising is necessary
<span id="line4480"></span>because they only feed freely, as a rule, from daybreak till about
<span id="line4481"></span>three hours after sun-rise. The heat of a summer or early autumn day
<span id="line4482"></span>makes them sluggish, but an hour or two in the evening is sometimes
<span id="line4483"></span>remunerative. The bait for them all should usually lie on the bottom,
<span id="line4484"></span>and it consists mainly of worms, wasp and other grubs, pastes of
<span id="line4485"></span>various kinds; and for carp, and sometimes bream, of vegetable baits
<span id="line4486"></span>such as small boiled potatoes, beans, peas, stewed wheat, pieces of
<span id="line4487"></span>banana, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. None of these fish feed well in winter.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4490"></span>consists of fish which will take a bait similar to those already
<span id="line4491"></span>mentioned and also a fly. The sizes which limit the ordinary angler's
<span id="line4492"></span>aspirations are roach about 2 lb, rudd about 2<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>frac12;</span> lb, dace about 1 lb
<span id="line4493"></span>and chub about 5 lb. There are instances of individuals heavier than
<span id="line4494"></span>this, one or two roach and many rudd of over 3 lb being on record,
<span id="line4495"></span>while dace have been caught up to 1 lb 6 oz., and chub of over 7 lb
<span id="line4496"></span>are not unknown. Roach only take a fly as a rule in very hot weather
<span id="line4497"></span>when they are near the surface, or early in the season when they
<span id="line4498"></span>are on the shallows; the others will take it freely all through the
<span id="line4499"></span>summer. Ordinary trout flies do well enough for all four species,
<span id="line4500"></span>but chub often prefer something larger, and big bushy lures called
<span id="line4501"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>palmers,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> which represent caterpillars, are generally used for them.
<span id="line4502"></span>The fly may be used either wet or dry for all these fish, and there
<span id="line4503"></span>is little to choose between the methods as regards effectiveness.
<span id="line4504"></span>Fly-fishing for these fish is a branch of angling which might be more
<span id="line4505"></span>practised than it is, as the sport is a very fair substitute for trout
<span id="line4506"></span>fishing. Roach, chub and dace feed on bottom food and give good sport

<span id="line4559"></span>sport to anglers, taking worm and occasionally fly or small spinning
<span id="line4560"></span>bait. It is a good fighter, and reaches a weight of about 3 lb. Its
<span id="line4561"></span>sheen when first caught is particularly beautiful. America also has

<span id="line4573"></span>considerable size (and it often reaches a weight of 8 lb or more) it
<span id="line4574"></span>is a splendid fighter and stronger than almost any fish that swims.
<span id="line4575"></span>Its life history has long been disputed, but it is now accepted that
<span id="line4576"></span>it breeds in the sea and ascends rivers in its youth. It is found
<span id="line4577"></span>practically everywhere, and its occurrence in isolated ponds to which
<span id="line4578"></span>it has never been introduced by human agency has given rise to a
<span id="line4579"></span>theory that it travels overland as well as by water. The best baits
<span id="line4580"></span>for eels are worms and small fish, and the best time to use them is at
<span id="line4581"></span>night or in thundery or very wet weather.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4584"></span>
<span id="line4585"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Sea angling is attended by almost as many refinements of tackle and
<span id="line4586"></span>method as fresh-water angling. The chief differences are differences
<span id="line4587"></span>of locality and the habits of the fish. To a certain extent sea
<span id="line4588"></span>angling may also be divided into three classes<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>fishing on the surface
<span id="line4589"></span>with the fly, at mid-water with spinning or other bait, and on the
<span id="line4590"></span>bottom; but the first method is only practicable at certain times and
<span id="line4591"></span>in certain places, and the others, from the great depths that often
<span id="line4592"></span>have to be sounded and the heavy weights that have to be used in
<span id="line4593"></span>searching them, necessitate shorter and stouter rods, larger reels and
<span id="line4594"></span>stronger tackle than fresh-water anglers employ. Also, of course, the
<span id="line4595"></span>sea-fisherman is liable to come into conflict with very large fish
<span id="line4596"></span>occasionally. In British waters the monster usually takes the form of
<span id="line4597"></span>a skate or halibut. A specimen of the former weighing 194 lb has
<span id="line4598"></span>been landed off the Irish coast with rod and line in recent years. In
<span id="line4599"></span>American waters there is a much greater opportunity of catching fish
<span id="line4600"></span>of this calibre.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4603"></span>are regularly pursued by American anglers, chief among them being
<span id="line4604"></span>the tarpon (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Tarpon atlanticus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and the tuna or tunny (Thunnus
<span id="line4605"></span>thynnus), which have been taken on rod and line up to 223 lb and 251
<span id="line4606"></span>lb respectively. Jew-fish and black sea-bass of over 400 lb have been
<span id="line4607"></span>taken on rod and line, and there are many other fine sporting fish
<span id="line4608"></span>of large size which give the angler exciting hours on the reefs of
<span id="line4609"></span>Florida, or the coasts of California, Texas or Mexico. Practically
<span id="line4610"></span>all of them are taken with a fish-bait either live or dead, and used
<span id="line4611"></span>stationary on the bottom or in mid-water trailed behind a boat.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4614"></span>most esteemed in British waters. The bass (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Labrax lupus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) heads
<span id="line4615"></span>the list as a plucky and rather difficult opponent. A fish of 10 lb is
<span id="line4616"></span>a large one, but fifteen-pounders have been taken. Small or <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>school<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>
<span id="line4617"></span>bass up to 3 lb or 4 lb may sometimes be caught with the fly
<span id="line4618"></span>(generally a roughly constructed thing with big wings), and when they
<span id="line4619"></span>are really taking the sport is magnificent. In some few localities it
<span id="line4620"></span>is possible to cast for them from rocks with a salmon rod, but usually
<span id="line4621"></span>a boat is required. In other places bass may be caught from the shore
<span id="line4622"></span>with fish bait used on the bottom in quite shallow water. They may
<span id="line4623"></span>again sometimes be caught in mid-water, and in fact there are few
<span id="line4624"></span>methods and few lures employed in sea angling which will not account
<span id="line4625"></span>for them at times. The pollack (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Gadus pollachius</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and coal-fish
<span id="line4626"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Gadus virens</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) come next in esteem. Both in some places reach a
<span id="line4627"></span>weight of 20 lb or more, and both when young will take a fly. Usually,
<span id="line4628"></span>however, the best sport is obtained by trailing some spinning-bait,
<span id="line4629"></span>such as an artificial or natural sand-eel, behind a boat. Sometimes,
<span id="line4630"></span>and especially for pollack, the bait must be kept near the bottom and
<span id="line4631"></span>heavy weights on the line are necessary; the coal-fish are more prone
<span id="line4632"></span>to come to the surface for feeding. The larger grey mullet (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Mugil
<span id="line4633"></span>capito</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is a great favourite with many anglers, as it is extremely
<span id="line4634"></span>difficult to hook, and when hooked fights strongly. Fishing for mullet
<span id="line4635"></span>is more akin to fresh-water fishing than any branch of sea-angling,
<span id="line4636"></span>and indeed can be carried on in almost fresh water, for the fish
<span id="line4637"></span>frequent harbours, estuaries and tidal pools. They can be caught
<span id="line4638"></span>close to the surface, at mid-water and at the bottom, and as a rule
<span id="line4639"></span>vegetable baits, such as boiled macaroni, or ragworms are found to
<span id="line4640"></span>answer best. Usually ground-baiting is necessary, and the finer the
<span id="line4641"></span>tackle used the greater is the chance of sport. Not a few anglers fish
<span id="line4642"></span>with a float as if for river fish. The fish runs up to about 8 lb in
<span id="line4643"></span>weight. The cod (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Gadus morhua</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) grows larger and fights less
<span id="line4644"></span>gamely than any of the fish already mentioned. It is generally caught
<span id="line4645"></span>with bait used on the bottom from a boat, but in places codling, or
<span id="line4646"></span>young cod, give some sport to anglers fishing from the shore. The
<span id="line4647"></span>mackerel (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Scomber scomber</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) gives the best sport to a bait,
<span id="line4648"></span>usually a strip of fish skin, trailed behind a boat fairly close to
<span id="line4649"></span>the surface, but it will sometimes feed on the bottom. Mackerel on
<span id="line4650"></span>light tackle are game fighters, though they do not usually much exceed
<span id="line4651"></span>2 lb. Whiting and whiting-pout (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Gadus merlangus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Gadus
<span id="line4652"></span>luscus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) both feed on or near the bottom, do not grow to any great
<span id="line4653"></span>size, and are best sought with fine tackle, usually an arrangement
<span id="line4654"></span>of three or four hooks at intervals above a lead which is called
<span id="line4655"></span>a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>paternoster.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> If one or more of the hooks are on the bottom the
<span id="line4656"></span>tackle will do for different kinds of flat fish as well, flounders
<span id="line4657"></span>and dabs being the two species most often caught by anglers. The
<span id="line4658"></span>bream (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Pagellus centrodontus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is another bottom-feeder which
<span id="line4659"></span>resembles the fresh-water bream both in appearance and habits. It is
<span id="line4660"></span>an early morning or rather a nocturnal fish, and grows to a weight of
<span id="line4661"></span>3 lb or 4 lb. Occasionally it will feed in mid-water or even close
<span id="line4662"></span>to the surface. The conger eel (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Conger vulgaris</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is another
<span id="line4663"></span>night-feeder, which gives fine sport, as it grows to a great size, and
<span id="line4664"></span>is very powerful. Strong tackle is essential for conger fishing, as so
<span id="line4665"></span>powerful an opponent in the darkness cannot be given any law. The bait
<span id="line4666"></span>must be on or near the bottom. There are, of course, many other fish
<span id="line4667"></span>which come to the angler's rod at times, but the list given is fairly
<span id="line4668"></span>complete as representing the species which are especially sought.

<span id="line4876"></span>to England with William the Conqueror. During the whole of the 12th
<span id="line4877"></span>century it shared with Latin the distinction of being the literary
<span id="line4878"></span>language of England, and it was in use at the court until the 14th
<span id="line4879"></span>century. It was not until the reign of Henry IV. that English became
<span id="line4880"></span>the native tongue of the kings of England. After the loss of the
<span id="line4881"></span>French provinces, schools for the teaching of French were established
<span id="line4882"></span>in England, among the most celebrated of which we may quote that
<span id="line4883"></span>of Marlborough. The language then underwent certain changes which
<span id="line4884"></span>gradually distinguished it from the French spoken in France; but,
<span id="line4885"></span>except for some graphical characteristics, from which certain rules
<span id="line4886"></span>of pronunciation are to be inferred, the changes to which the language
<span id="line4887"></span>was subjected were the individual modifications of the various
<span id="line4888"></span>authors, so that, while we may still speak of Anglo-Norman writers, an
<span id="line4889"></span>Anglo-Norman language, properly so called, gradually ceased to exist.

<span id="line4901"></span>decline in the study of French and the disappearance of Anglo-Norman
<span id="line4902"></span>literature, the French language continued, through some vicissitudes,
<span id="line4903"></span>to be the classical language of the courts of justice until the 17th
<span id="line4904"></span>century. It is still the language of the Channel Islands, though there

<span id="line4910"></span>generally said to coincide with the loss of the French provinces to
<span id="line4911"></span>Philip Augustus, but literary and political history do not correspond
<span id="line4912"></span>quite so precisely, and the end of the first period would be more
<span id="line4913"></span>accurately denoted by the appearance of the history of William
<span id="line4914"></span>the Marshal in 1225 (published for the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Societe de l'histoire de
<span id="line4915"></span>France</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, by Paul Meyer, 3 vols., 1891-1901). It owes its brilliancy
<span id="line4916"></span>largely to the protection accorded by Henry II. of England to the men
<span id="line4917"></span>of letters of his day. <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>He could speak French and Latin well, and is
<span id="line4918"></span>said to have known something of every tongue between'the Bay of Biscay

<span id="line4920"></span>his day, and amid all his busy active life he never lost his interest

<span id="line4923"></span>Wace and Beno<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>icirc;</span>t de Sainte-More compiled their histories at his
<span id="line4924"></span>bidding, and it was in his reign that Marie de France composed her
<span id="line4925"></span>poems. An event with which he was closely connected, viz. the murder
<span id="line4926"></span>of Thomas Becket, gave rise to a whole series of writings, some of
<span id="line4927"></span>which are purely Anglo-Norman. In his time appeared the works of
<span id="line4928"></span>B<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>roul and Thomas respectively, as well as some of the most celebrated
<span id="line4929"></span>of the Anglo-Norman </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>romans d'aventure</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. It is important to keep
<span id="line4930"></span>this fact in mind when studying the different works which Anglo-Norman
<span id="line4931"></span>literature has left us. We will examine these works briefly, grouping
<span id="line4932"></span>them into narrative, didactic, hagiographic, lyric, satiric and
<span id="line4933"></span>dramatic literature.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4941"></span>Anglo-Norman manuscript of the British Museum (now lost), although
<span id="line4942"></span>the author was certainly a Parisian. The oldest manuscript of the
<span id="line4943"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Chanson de Roland</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> that we possess is also a manuscript written
<span id="line4944"></span>in England, and amongst the others of less importance we may mention

<span id="line4947"></span>xxxii. 597-618). Although the diffusion of epic poetry in England did
<span id="line4948"></span>not actually inspire any new </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>chansons de geste</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, it developed
<span id="line4949"></span>the taste for this class of literature, and the epic style in which
<span id="line4950"></span>the tales of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Horn</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bovon de Hampton</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Guy of

<span id="line4953"></span>this circumstance. Although the last of these works has come down
<span id="line4954"></span>to us only in a prose version, it contains unmistakable signs of a
<span id="line4955"></span>previous poetic form, and what we possess is really only a rendering

<span id="line4962"></span>in the epic poetry of the period. The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Lay of Orpheus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> is known

<span id="line4964"></span>composed by Robert Biket, an Anglo-Norman poet of the 12th century
<span id="line4965"></span>(Wulff, Lund, 1888). The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>lais</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Marie de France were written
<span id="line4966"></span>in England, and the greater number of the romances composing the

<span id="line4968"></span>through the medium of Anglo-Norman. The legends of Merlin and Arthur,
<span id="line4969"></span>collected in the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Historia Regum Britanniae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> by Geoffrey
<span id="line4970"></span>of Monmouth (<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8224;</span> 1154), passed into French literature, bearing the
<span id="line4971"></span>character which the bishop of St. Asaph had stamped upon them.
<span id="line4972"></span>Chr<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>tien de Troye's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Perceval</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (c. 1175) is doubtless based on an
<span id="line4973"></span>Anglo-Norman poem. Robert de Boron (c. 1215) took the subject of his
<span id="line4974"></span>Merlin (published by G. Paris and J. Ulrich, 1886, 2 vols., </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Soci<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>t<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>

<span id="line4976"></span>most celebrated love-legend of the middle ages, and one of the most
<span id="line4977"></span>beautiful inventions of world-literature, the story of Tristan and
<span id="line4978"></span>Iseult, tempted two authors, B<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>roul and Thomas, the first of whom
<span id="line4979"></span>is probably, and the second certainly, Anglo-Norman (see ARTHURIAN
<span id="line4980"></span>LEGEND; GRAIL, THE HOLY; TRISTAN). One </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Folie Tristan</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> was
<span id="line4981"></span>composed in England in the last years of the 12th century. (For all
<span id="line4982"></span>these questions see </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Soc. des Anc. Textes</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, Muret's ed. 1903;
<span id="line4983"></span>B<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>dier's ed. 1902-1905). Less fascinating than the story of Tristan
<span id="line4984"></span>and Iseult, but nevertheless of considerable interest, are the
<span id="line4985"></span>two </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>romans d'aventure</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Hugh of Rutland, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Ipomedon</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line4988"></span>relates the adventures of a knight who married the young duchess of
<span id="line4989"></span>Calabria, niece of King Meleager of Sicily, but was loved by Medea,
<span id="line4990"></span>the king's wife. The second poem is the sequel to </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Ipomedon</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, and
<span id="line4991"></span>deals with the wars and subsequent reconciliation between Ipomedon's
<span id="line4992"></span>sons, Daunus, the elder, lord of Apulia, and Protesilaus, the younger,
<span id="line4993"></span>lord of Calabria. Protesilaus defeats Daunus, who had expelled him
<span id="line4994"></span>from Calabria. He saves his brother's life, is reinvested with the
<span id="line4995"></span>dukedom of Calabria, and, after the death of Daunus, succeeds to
<span id="line4996"></span>Apulia. He subsequently marries Medea, King Meleager's widow, who
<span id="line4997"></span>had helped him to seize Apulia, having transferred her affection for
<span id="line4998"></span>Ipomedon to his younger son (cf. Ward, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cat. of Rom.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, i.

<span id="line5062"></span>historical documents, but he stops at the year 1087, just when he has
<span id="line5063"></span>reached the period about which he might have been able to give us some

<span id="line5081"></span>is based on the work of Wace. It was composed at the request of
<span id="line5082"></span>Henry II. about 1170, and takes us as far as the year 1135 (ed. by

<span id="line5084"></span>3 vols.). The 43,000 lines which it contains are of but little
<span id="line5085"></span>interest to the historian; they are too evidently the work of
<span id="line5086"></span>a </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>romancier courtois,</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> who takes pleasure in recounting
<span id="line5087"></span>love-adventures such as those he has described in his romance of
<span id="line5088"></span>Troy. Other works, however, give us more trustworthy information, for
<span id="line5089"></span>example, the anonymous poem on Henry II.'s </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Conquest of Ireland</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5090"></span>in 1172 (ed. Francisque Michel, London, 1837), which, together with
<span id="line5091"></span>the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Expugnatio hibernica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Giraud de Barri, constitutes our
<span id="line5092"></span>chief authority on this subject. The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Conquest of Ireland</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> was
<span id="line5093"></span>republished in 1892 by Goddard Henry Orpen, under the title of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The
<span id="line5094"></span>Song of Dermot and the Earl</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (Oxford, Clarendon Press). Similarly,
<span id="line5095"></span>Jourdain Fantosme, who was in the north of England in 1174, wrote an
<span id="line5096"></span>account of the wars between Henry II., his sons, William the Lion of
<span id="line5097"></span>Scotland and Louis VII., in 1173 and 1174 (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Chronicle of the reigns
<span id="line5098"></span>of Stephen</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> ... III., ed. by Joseph Stevenson and Fr. Michel,
<span id="line5099"></span>London, 1886, pp. 202-307). Not one of these histories, however, is to
<span id="line5100"></span>be compared in value with </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>The History of William the Marshal, Count
<span id="line5101"></span>of Striguil and Pembroke,</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> regent of England from 1216-1219,
<span id="line5102"></span>which was found and subsequently edited by Paul Meyer (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Soci<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>t<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span> de
<span id="line5103"></span>l'histoire de France,</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> 3 vols., 1891-1901). This masterpiece of
<span id="line5104"></span>historiography was composed in 1225 or 1226 by a professional poet of
<span id="line5105"></span>talent at the request of William, son of the marshal. It was compiled
<span id="line5106"></span>from the notes of the marshal's squire, John d'Early (<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8224;</span> 1230 or 1231),
<span id="line5107"></span>who shared all the vicissitudes of his master's life and was one of
<span id="line5108"></span>the executors of his will. This work is of great value for the history
<span id="line5109"></span>of the period 1186-1219, as the information furnished by John d'Early
<span id="line5110"></span>is either personal or obtained at first hand. In the part which deals
<span id="line5111"></span>with the period before 1186, it is true, there are various mistakes,
<span id="line5112"></span>due to the author's ignorance of contemporary history, but these
<span id="line5113"></span>slight blemishes are amply atoned for by the literary value of
<span id="line5114"></span>the work. The style is concise, the anecdotes are well told, the
<span id="line5115"></span>descriptions short and picturesque; the whole constitutes one of the
<span id="line5116"></span>most living pictures of medieval society. Very pale by the side of
<span id="line5117"></span>this work appear the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Chronique</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of Peter of Langtoft, written

<span id="line5364"></span>now a mere fragment, and it is known to have been a transcript of A.
<span id="line5365"></span>F is bilingual, the entries being given both in Saxon and Latin. It
<span id="line5366"></span>is interesting as a stage in the transition from the vernacular to
<span id="line5367"></span>the Latin chronicle; but it has little independent value, being a
<span id="line5368"></span>mere epitome, made at Canterbury in the 11th or 12th century, of a
<span id="line5369"></span>chronicle akin to E. B, as far as it goes (to 977), is identical with
<span id="line5370"></span>C, both having been copied from a common original, but A, C, D, E have
<span id="line5371"></span>every right to be treated as independent chronicles. The relations
<span id="line5372"></span>between the four vary very greatly in different parts, and the neglect
<span id="line5373"></span>of this consideration has led to much error and confusion. The common
<span id="line5374"></span>stock, out of which all grow, extends to 892. The present writer sees
<span id="line5375"></span>no reason to doubt that the idea of a national, as opposed to earlier
<span id="line5376"></span>local chronicles, was inspired by Alfred, who may even have dictated,
<span id="line5377"></span>or at least revised, the entries relating to his own campaigns; while
<span id="line5378"></span>for the earlier parts pre-existing materials, both oral and written,
<span id="line5379"></span>were utilized. Among the latter the chronological epitome appended to
<span id="line5380"></span>Bede's </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Ecclesiastical History</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> may be specially mentioned. But
<span id="line5381"></span>even this common stock exists in two different recensions, in A, B, C,
<span id="line5382"></span>on the one hand, and D, E on the other. The main points of
<span id="line5383"></span>difference are that in D, E (1) a series of northern annals have
<span id="line5384"></span>been incorporated; (2) the Bede entries are taken, not from the
<span id="line5385"></span>brief epitome, but from the main body of the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Eccl. Hist.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> The
<span id="line5386"></span>inference is that, shortly after the compiling of this Alfredian
<span id="line5387"></span>chronicle, a copy of it was sent to some northern monastery, probably
<span id="line5388"></span>Ripon, where it was expanded in the way indicated. Copies of this
<span id="line5389"></span>northernized Chronicle afterwards found their way to the south. The
<span id="line5390"></span>impulse given by Alfred was continued under Edward, and we have what
<span id="line5391"></span>may be called an official continuation of the history of the Danish
<span id="line5392"></span>wars, which, in B, C, D extends to 915, and in A to 924. After 915 B,
<span id="line5393"></span>C insert as a separate document a short register of Mercian affairs
<span id="line5394"></span>during the same period (902-924), which might be called the acts
<span id="line5395"></span>of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelflaed, the famous <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Lady of the Mercians,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> while D has
<span id="line5396"></span>incorporated it, not very skilfully, with the official continuation.
<span id="line5397"></span>Neither of these documents exists in E. From 925 to 975 all the
<span id="line5398"></span>chronicles are very fragmentary; a few obits, three or four poems,
<span id="line5399"></span>among them the famous ballad on the battle of Brunanburh, make up
<span id="line5400"></span>the meagre tale of their common materials, which each has tried to
<span id="line5401"></span>supplement in its own way. A has inserted a number of Winchester
<span id="line5402"></span>entries, which prove that A is a Winchester book. And this local and
<span id="line5403"></span>scrappy character it retains to 1001, where it practically ends. At
<span id="line5404"></span>some subsequent time it was transferred bodily to Canterbury, where it
<span id="line5405"></span>received numerous interpolations in the earlier part, and a few later
<span id="line5406"></span>local entries which finally tail off into the Latin acts of Lanfranc.
<span id="line5407"></span>A may therefore be dismissed. C has added to the common stock one or
<span id="line5408"></span>two Abingdon entries, with which place the history of C is closely
<span id="line5409"></span>connected; while D and E have a second group of northern annals
<span id="line5410"></span>901-966, E being however much more fragmentary than D, omitting, or
<span id="line5411"></span>not having access to, much both of the common and of the northern
<span id="line5412"></span>material which is found in D. From 983 to 1018 C, D and E are
<span id="line5413"></span>practically identical, and give a connected history of the Danish
<span id="line5414"></span>struggles under <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelred II. This section was probably composed at
<span id="line5415"></span>Canterbury. From 1018 the relations of C, D, E become too complicated
<span id="line5416"></span>to be expressed by any formula; sometimes all three agree together,
<span id="line5417"></span>sometimes all three are independent; in other places each pair in
<span id="line5418"></span>turn agree against the third. It may be noted that C is strongly
<span id="line5419"></span>anti-Godwinist, while E is equally pro-Godwinist, D occupying an
<span id="line5420"></span>intermediate position. C extends to 1066, where it ends abruptly, and
<span id="line5421"></span>probably mutilated. D ends at 1079 and is certainly mutilated. In
<span id="line5422"></span>its later history D is associated with some place in the diocese of
<span id="line5423"></span>Worcester, probably Evesham. In its present form D is a comparatively
<span id="line5424"></span>late MS., none of it probably much earlier, and some of it later, than
<span id="line5425"></span>1100. In the case of entries in the earlier part of the chronicles,
<span id="line5426"></span>which are peculiar to D, we cannot exclude the possibility that they
<span id="line5427"></span>may be late interpolations. E is continued to 1154. In its present
<span id="line5428"></span>form it is unquestionably a Peterborough book. The earlier part is
<span id="line5429"></span>full of Peterborough interpolations, to which place many of the later
<span id="line5430"></span>entries also refer. But (apart from the interpolations) it is only the
<span id="line5431"></span>entries after 1121, where the first hand in the MS. ends, which were
<span id="line5432"></span>actually composed at Peterborough. The section 1023-1067
<span id="line5433"></span>certainly, and possibly also the section 1068-1121, was composed at
<span id="line5434"></span>St. Augustine's, Canterbury; and the former is of extreme interest
<span id="line5435"></span>and value, the writer being in close contact with the events which he
<span id="line5436"></span>describes. The later parts of E show a great degeneration in language,
<span id="line5437"></span>and a querulous tone due to the sufferings of the native population
<span id="line5438"></span>under the harsh Norman rule; <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>but our debt to it is inestimable; and
<span id="line5439"></span>we can hardly measure what the loss to English history would have
<span id="line5440"></span>been, if it had not been written; or if, having been written, it had,
<span id="line5441"></span>like so many another English chronicle, been lost.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line5444"></span>ii. of the Rev. C. Plummer's edition of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Two of the Saxon Chronicles
<span id="line5445"></span>Parallel</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (Clarendon Press, 1892, 1899); to which the student may
<span id="line5446"></span>be referred for detailed arguments. The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>editio princeps</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> of the
<span id="line5447"></span>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was by Abraham Wheloc, professor of Arabic at
<span id="line5448"></span>Cambridge, where the work was printed (1643-1644). It was based mainly
<span id="line5449"></span>on the MS. called G above, and is the chief source of our knowledge of
<span id="line5450"></span>that MS. which perished, all but three leaves, in the Cottonian fire
<span id="line5451"></span>of 1723. Edmund Gibson of Queen's College, Oxford, afterwards bishop
<span id="line5452"></span>of London, published an edition in 1692. He used Wheloc's edition, and
<span id="line5453"></span>E, with collations or transcripts of B and F. Both Wheloc and Gibson
<span id="line5454"></span>give Latin translations. In 1823 appeared an edition by Dr. Ingram, of
<span id="line5455"></span>Trinity College, Oxford, with an English translation. Besides A, B, E,
<span id="line5456"></span>F, Ingram used C and D for the first time. But both he and Gibson made
<span id="line5457"></span>the fatal error of trying to combine the disparate materials contained
<span id="line5458"></span>in the various chronicles in a single text. An improvement in this
<span id="line5459"></span>respect is seen in the edition made by Richard Price (d. 1833) for
<span id="line5460"></span>the first (and only) volume of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Monumenta Historica Britannica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5461"></span>(folio 1848). There is still, however, too much conflation, and
<span id="line5462"></span>owing to the plan of the volume, the edition only extends to 1066. A
<span id="line5463"></span>translation is appended. In 1861 appeared Benjamin Thorpe's six-text
<span id="line5464"></span>edition in the Rolls Series. Though not free from defects, this
<span id="line5465"></span>edition is absolutely indispensable for the study of the chronicles
<span id="line5466"></span>and the mutual relations of the different MSS. A second volume
<span id="line5467"></span>contains the translation. In 1865 the Clarendon Press published </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Two
<span id="line5468"></span>Saxon Chronicles (A and E) Parallel, with supplementary extracts
<span id="line5469"></span>from the others</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, by the Rev. John Earle. This edition has no
<span id="line5470"></span>translation, but in the notes and introduction a very considerable
<span id="line5471"></span>advance was made. On this edition is partly based the later edition
<span id="line5472"></span>by the Rev. C. Plummer, already cited above. In addition to the
<span id="line5473"></span>translations contained in the editions already mentioned, the
<span id="line5474"></span>following have been issued separately. The first translation into
<span id="line5475"></span>modern English was by Miss Anna Gurney, privately printed in 1819.
<span id="line5476"></span>This was largely based on Gibson's edition, and was in turn the basis
<span id="line5477"></span>of Dr. Giles' translation, published in 1847, and often reprinted. The
<span id="line5478"></span>best translation is that by the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, in his series
<span id="line5479"></span>of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Church Historians of England</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (1853). Up to the Conquest it
<span id="line5480"></span>is a revision of the translation contained in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Mon. Hist. Brit.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line5489"></span>obtained in England before the Norman conquest constitutes, with
<span id="line5490"></span>the Scandinavian laws, the most genuine expression of Teutonic legal
<span id="line5491"></span>thought. While the so-called <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>barbaric laws<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>leges barbarorum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>)
<span id="line5492"></span>of the continent, not excepting those compiled in the territory now
<span id="line5493"></span>called Germany, were largely the product of Roman influence, the
<span id="line5494"></span>continuity of Roman life was almost completely broken in the island,
<span id="line5495"></span>and even the Church, the direct heir of Roman tradition, did not carry
<span id="line5496"></span>on a continuous existence: Canterbury was not a see formed in a Roman
<span id="line5497"></span>province in the same sense as Tours or Reims. One of the striking
<span id="line5498"></span>expressions of this Teutonism is presented by the language in which
<span id="line5499"></span>the Anglo-Saxon laws were written. They are uniformly worded in
<span id="line5500"></span>English, while continental laws, apart from the Scandinavian, are all
<span id="line5501"></span>in Latin. The English dialect in which the Anglo-Saxon laws have been
<span id="line5502"></span>handed down to us is in most cases a common speech derived from West
<span id="line5503"></span>Saxon<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>naturally enough as Wessex became the predominant English
<span id="line5504"></span>state, and the court of its kings the principal literary centre from
<span id="line5505"></span>which most of the compilers and scribes derived their dialect and
<span id="line5506"></span>spelling. Traces of Kentish speech may be detected, however, in the
<span id="line5507"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Textus Roffensis</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the MS. of the Kentish laws, and Northumbrian
<span id="line5508"></span>dialectical peculiarities are also noticeable on some occasions,
<span id="line5509"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0036</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0036</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0036]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5510"></span>while Danish words occur only as technical terms. At the
<span id="line5511"></span>conquest, Latin takes the place of English in the compilations made
<span id="line5512"></span>to meet the demand for Anglo-Saxon law texts as still applied in
<span id="line5513"></span>practice.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5514"></span>
<span id="line5515"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>2. It is easy to group the Anglo-Saxon laws according to the manner of
<span id="line5516"></span>their publication. They would fall into three divisions: (1) laws and
<span id="line5517"></span>collections of laws promulgated by public authority; (2) statements of
<span id="line5518"></span>custom; (3) private compilations of legal rules and enactments. To
<span id="line5519"></span>the first division belong the laws of the Kentish kings, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelberht,
<span id="line5520"></span>Hlothhere and Eadric, Withraed; those of Ine of Wessex, of Alfred,
<span id="line5521"></span>Edward the Elder, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelstan,</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>='<a class="attribute-value">FNanchor_1_61</a>'&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>='<a class="attribute-value" href="view-source:https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13600/13600-h/13600-h.htm#Footnote_1_61">#Footnote_1_61</a>'&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span>[1]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sup</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span> Edmund, Edgar, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelred and Canute;
<span id="line5522"></span>the treaty between Alfred and Guthrum and the so-called treaty between
<span id="line5523"></span>Edward and Guthrum. The second division is formed by the convention
<span id="line5524"></span>between the English and the Welsh </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Dunsaetas</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the law of the
<span id="line5525"></span>Northumbrian priests, the customs of the North people, the fragments
<span id="line5526"></span>of local custumals entered in Domesday Book. The third division
<span id="line5527"></span>would consist of the collections of the so-called </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Pseudo-leges
<span id="line5528"></span>Canuti</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the laws of Edward the Confessor, of Henry I., and the
<span id="line5529"></span>great compilation of the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Quadripartitus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, then of a number of
<span id="line5530"></span>short notices and extracts like the fragments on the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>wedding of a
<span id="line5531"></span>wife,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> on oaths, on ordeals, on the king's peace, on rural customs
<span id="line5532"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Rectitudines singularum personarum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), the treatises on the
<span id="line5533"></span>reeve (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>gerefa</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and on the judge (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>dema</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), formulae of
<span id="line5534"></span>oaths, notions as to wergeld, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. A fourth group might be made of the
<span id="line5535"></span>charters, as they are based on Old English private and public law
<span id="line5536"></span>and supply us with most important materials in regard to it. Looking
<span id="line5537"></span>somewhat deeper at the sources from which Old English law was derived,
<span id="line5538"></span>we shall have to modify our classification to some extent, as the
<span id="line5539"></span>external forms of publication, although important from the point of
<span id="line5540"></span>view of historical criticism, are not sufficient standards as to
<span id="line5541"></span>the juridical character of the various kinds of material. Direct
<span id="line5542"></span>statements of law would fall under the following heads, from the point
<span id="line5543"></span>of view of their legal origins: i. customary rules followed by divers
<span id="line5544"></span>communities capable of formulating law; ii. enactments of authorities,
<span id="line5545"></span>especially of kings; iii. private arrangements made under recognized
<span id="line5546"></span>legal rules. The first would comprise, besides most of the statements
<span id="line5547"></span>of custom included in the second division according to the first
<span id="line5548"></span>classification, a great many of the rules entered in collections
<span id="line5549"></span>promulgated by kings; most of the paragraphs of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelberht's,
<span id="line5550"></span>Hlothhere's, and Eadric's and Ine's laws, are popular legal customs
<span id="line5551"></span>that have received the stamp of royal authority by their insertion in
<span id="line5552"></span>official codes. On the other hand, from Withraed's and Alfred's laws
<span id="line5553"></span>downwards, the element of enactment by central authority becomes more
<span id="line5554"></span>and more prominent. The kings endeavour, with the help of secular
<span id="line5555"></span>and clerical witan, to introduce new rules and to break the power
<span id="line5556"></span>of long-standing customs (e.g. the precepts about the keeping of
<span id="line5557"></span>holidays, the enactments of Edmund restricting private vengeance,
<span id="line5558"></span>and the solidarity of kindreds as to feuds, and the like). There are,
<span id="line5559"></span>however, no outward signs enabling us to distinguish conclusively
<span id="line5560"></span>between both categories of laws in the codes, nor is it possible to
<span id="line5561"></span>draw a line between permanent laws and personal ordinances of single
<span id="line5562"></span>sovereigns, as has been attempted in the case of Frankish legislation.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5563"></span>
<span id="line5564"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>3. Even in the course of a general survey of the legal lore at
<span id="line5565"></span>our disposal, one cannot help being struck by peculiarities in the
<span id="line5566"></span>distribution of legal subjects. Matters which seem to us of primary
<span id="line5567"></span>importance and occupy a wide place in our law-books are almost
<span id="line5568"></span>entirely absent in Anglo-Saxon laws or relegated to the background.
<span id="line5569"></span>While it is impossible to give here anything like a complete or
<span id="line5570"></span>exact survey of the field<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>a task rendered almost impossible by the
<span id="line5571"></span>arbitrary manner in which paragraphs are divided, by the difficulty
<span id="line5572"></span>of making Old English enactments fit into modern rubrics, and by the
<span id="line5573"></span>necessity of counting several times certain paragraphs bearing on
<span id="line5574"></span>different subjects<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>a brief statistical analysis of the contents of
<span id="line5575"></span>royal codes and laws may be found instructive.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5576"></span>
<span id="line5577"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>We find roughly 419 paragraphs devoted to criminal law and procedure
<span id="line5578"></span>as against 91 concerned with questions of private law and civil
<span id="line5579"></span>procedure. Of the criminal law clauses, as many as 238 are taken
<span id="line5580"></span>up with tariffs of fines, while 80 treat of capital and corporal
<span id="line5581"></span>punishment, outlawry and confiscation, and 101 include rules of
<span id="line5582"></span>procedure. On the private law side 18 clauses apply to rights of
<span id="line5583"></span>property and possession, 13 to succession and family law, 37 to
<span id="line5584"></span>contracts, including marriage when treated as an act of sale; 18 touch
<span id="line5585"></span>on civil procedure. A subject which attracted special attention was
<span id="line5586"></span>the law of status, and no less than 107 paragraphs contain disposition
<span id="line5587"></span>dictated by the wish to discriminate between the classes of society.
<span id="line5588"></span>Questions of public law and administration are discussed in 217
<span id="line5589"></span>clauses, while 197 concern the Church in one way or another, apart
<span id="line5590"></span>from purely ecclesiastical collections. In the public law division it
<span id="line5591"></span>is chiefly the power, interests and privileges of the king that are
<span id="line5592"></span>dealt with, in roughly 93 paragraphs, while local administration comes
<span id="line5593"></span>in for 39 and purely economic and fiscal matter for 13 clauses. Police
<span id="line5594"></span>regulations are very much to the fore and occupy no less than 72
<span id="line5595"></span>clauses of the royal legislation. As to church matters, the most
<span id="line5596"></span>prolific group is formed by general precepts based on religious and
<span id="line5597"></span>moral considerations, roughly 115, while secular privileges conferred
<span id="line5598"></span>on the Church hold about 62, and questions of organization some 20
<span id="line5599"></span>clauses.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5600"></span>
<span id="line5601"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The statistical contrasts are especially sharp and characteristic when
<span id="line5602"></span>we take into account the chronological sequence in the elaboration of
<span id="line5603"></span>laws. Practically the entire code of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelberht, for instance, is a
<span id="line5604"></span>tariff of fines for crimes, and the same subject continues to occupy
<span id="line5605"></span>a great place in the laws of Hlothhere and Eadric, Ine and Alfred,
<span id="line5606"></span>whereas it appears only occasionally in the treaties with the Danes,
<span id="line5607"></span>the laws of Withraed, Edward the Elder, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelstan, Edgar, Edmund and
<span id="line5608"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelred. It reappears in some strength in the code of Canute, but the
<span id="line5609"></span>latter is chiefly a recapitulation of former enactments. The system of
<span id="line5610"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>compositions<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or fines, paid in many cases with the help of kinsmen,
<span id="line5611"></span>finds its natural place in the ancient, tribal period of English
<span id="line5612"></span>history and loses its vitality later on in consequence of the growth
<span id="line5613"></span>of central power and of the scattering of maegths. Royalty and the
<span id="line5614"></span>Church, when they acquire the lead in social life, work out a
<span id="line5615"></span>new penal system based on outlawry, death penalties and corporal
<span id="line5616"></span>punishments, which make their first appearance in the legislation of
<span id="line5617"></span>Withraed and culminate in that of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelred and Canute.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5618"></span>
<span id="line5619"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>As regards status, the most elaborate enactments fall into the period
<span id="line5620"></span>preceding the Danish settlements. After the treaties with the Danes,
<span id="line5621"></span>the tendency is to simplify distinctions on the lines of an opposition
<span id="line5622"></span>between twelvehynd-men and twyhynd-men, paving the way towards
<span id="line5623"></span>the feudal distinction between the free and the unfree. In the
<span id="line5624"></span>arrangements of the commonwealth the clauses treating of royal
<span id="line5625"></span>privileges are more or less evenly distributed over all reigns, but
<span id="line5626"></span>the systematic development of police functions, especially in regard
<span id="line5627"></span>to responsibility for crimes, the catching of thieves, the suppression
<span id="line5628"></span>of lawlessness, is mainly the object of 10th and 11th century
<span id="line5629"></span>legislation. The reign of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelred, which witnessed the greatest
<span id="line5630"></span>national humiliation and the greatest crime in English history, is
<span id="line5631"></span>also marked by the most lavish expressions of religious feeling and
<span id="line5632"></span>the most frequent appeals to morality. This sketch would, of course,
<span id="line5633"></span>have to be modified in many ways if we attempted to treat the
<span id="line5634"></span>unofficial fragments of customary law in the same way as the
<span id="line5635"></span>paragraphs of royal codes, and even more so if we were able to
<span id="line5636"></span>tabulate the indirect evidence as to legal rules. But, imperfect as
<span id="line5637"></span>such statistics may be, they give us at any rate some insight into the
<span id="line5638"></span>direction of governmental legislation.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5639"></span>
<span id="line5640"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>4. The next question to be approached concerns the pedigree of
<span id="line5641"></span>Anglo-Saxon law and the latter's natural affinities. What is its
<span id="line5642"></span>position in the legal history of Germanic nations? How far has it been
<span id="line5643"></span>influenced by non-Germanic elements, especially by Roman and Canon
<span id="line5644"></span>law? The oldest Anglo-Saxon codes, especially the Kentish and the
<span id="line5645"></span>West Saxon ones, disclose a close relationship to the barbaric laws
<span id="line5646"></span>of Lower Germany<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>those of Saxons, Frisians, Thuringians. We find a
<span id="line5647"></span>division of social ranks which reminds us of the threefold gradation
<span id="line5648"></span>of Lower Germany
<span id="line5649"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0037</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0037</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0037]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5650"></span>(edelings, frilings, lazzen-eorls, ceorls, laets), and
<span id="line5651"></span>not of the twofold Frankish one (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>ingenui Franci, Romani</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), nor
<span id="line5652"></span>of the minute differentiation of the Upper Germans and Lombards. In
<span id="line5653"></span>subsequent history there is a good deal of resemblance between the
<span id="line5654"></span>capitularies' legislation of Charlemagne and his successors on one
<span id="line5655"></span>hand, the acts of Alfred, Edward the Elder, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelstan and Edgar on the
<span id="line5656"></span>other, a resemblance called forth less by direct borrowing of
<span id="line5657"></span>Frankish institutions than by the similarity of political problems
<span id="line5658"></span>and condition. Frankish law becomes a powerful modifying element
<span id="line5659"></span>in English legal history after the Conquest, when it was introduced
<span id="line5660"></span>wholesale in royal and in feudal courts. The Scandinavian invasions
<span id="line5661"></span>brought in many northern legal customs, especially in the districts
<span id="line5662"></span>thickly populated with Danes. The Domesday survey of Lincolnshire,
<span id="line5663"></span>Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Norfolk, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., shows remarkable deviations
<span id="line5664"></span>in local organization and justice (lagmen, sokes), and great
<span id="line5665"></span>peculiarities as to status (socmen, freemen), while from laws and
<span id="line5666"></span>a few charters we can perceive some influence on criminal law
<span id="line5667"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>nidings-vaerk</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), special usages as to fines (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>lahslit</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>),
<span id="line5668"></span>the keeping of peace, attestation and sureties of acts
<span id="line5669"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>faestermen</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. But, on the whole, the introduction of Danish
<span id="line5670"></span>and Norse elements, apart from local cases, was more important owing
<span id="line5671"></span>to the conflicts and compromises it called forth and its social
<span id="line5672"></span>results,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>than on account of any distinct trail of Scandinavian
<span id="line5673"></span>views in English law. The Scandinavian newcomers coalesced easily and
<span id="line5674"></span>quickly with the native population.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5675"></span>
<span id="line5676"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The direct influence of Roman law was not great during the Saxon
<span id="line5677"></span>period: we notice neither the transmission of important legal
<span id="line5678"></span>doctrines, chiefly through the medium of Visigothic codes, nor the
<span id="line5679"></span>continuous stream of Roman tradition in local usage. But indirectly
<span id="line5680"></span>Roman law did exert a by no means insignificant influence through the
<span id="line5681"></span>medium of the Church, which, for all its insular character, was still
<span id="line5682"></span>permeated with Roman ideas and forms of culture. The Old English
<span id="line5683"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>books<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> are derived in a roundabout way from Roman models, and the
<span id="line5684"></span>tribal law of real property was deeply modified by the introduction of
<span id="line5685"></span>individualistic notions as to ownership, donations, wills, rights of
<span id="line5686"></span>women, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. Yet in this respect also the Norman Conquest increased the
<span id="line5687"></span>store of Roman conceptions by breaking the national isolation of the
<span id="line5688"></span>English Church and opening the way for closer intercourse with France
<span id="line5689"></span>and Italy.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5690"></span>
<span id="line5691"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>5. It would be useless to attempt to trace in a brief sketch
<span id="line5692"></span>the history of the legal principles embodied in the documents of
<span id="line5693"></span>Anglo-Saxon law. But it may be of some value to give an outline of a
<span id="line5694"></span>few particularly characteristic subjects.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5695"></span>
<span id="line5696"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(a) The Anglo-Saxon legal system cannot be understood unless one
<span id="line5697"></span>realizes the fundamental opposition between folk-right and privilege.
<span id="line5698"></span>Folk-right is the aggregate of rules, formulated or latent but
<span id="line5699"></span>susceptible of formulation, which can be appealed to as the expression
<span id="line5700"></span>of the juridical consciousness of the people at large or of the
<span id="line5701"></span>communities of which it is composed. It is tribal in its origin, and
<span id="line5702"></span>differentiated, not according to boundaries between states, but on
<span id="line5703"></span>national and provincial lines. There may be the folk-right of West and
<span id="line5704"></span>East Saxons, of East Angles, of Kentish men, Mercians, Northumbrians,
<span id="line5705"></span>Danes, Welshmen, and these main folk-right divisions remain even when
<span id="line5706"></span>tribal kingdoms disappear and the people is concentrated in one or
<span id="line5707"></span>two realms. The chief centres for the formulation and application of
<span id="line5708"></span>folk-right were in the 10th and 11th centuries the shire-moots, while
<span id="line5709"></span>the witan of the realm generally placed themselves on the higher
<span id="line5710"></span>ground of State expediency, although occasionally using folk-right
<span id="line5711"></span>ideas. The older law of real property, of succession, of contracts,
<span id="line5712"></span>the customary tariffs of fines, were mainly regulated by folk-right;
<span id="line5713"></span>the reeves employed by the king and great men were supposed to take
<span id="line5714"></span>care of local and rural affairs according to folk-right. The law had
<span id="line5715"></span>to be declared and applied by the people itself in its communities,
<span id="line5716"></span>while the spokesmen of the people were neither democratic majorities
<span id="line5717"></span>nor individual experts, but a few leading men<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the twelve eldest
<span id="line5718"></span>thanes or some similar quorum. Folk-right could, however, be broken
<span id="line5719"></span>or modified by special law or special grant, and the fountain of such
<span id="line5720"></span>privileges was the royal power. Alterations and exceptions were, as
<span id="line5721"></span>a matter of fact, suggested by the interested parties themselves,
<span id="line5722"></span>and chiefly by the Church. Thus a privileged land-tenure was
<span id="line5723"></span>created<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>bookland; the rules as to the succession of kinsmen were set
<span id="line5724"></span>at nought by concession of testamentary power and confirmations of
<span id="line5725"></span>grants and wills; special exemptions from the jurisdiction of the
<span id="line5726"></span>hundreds and special privileges as to levying fines were conferred.
<span id="line5727"></span>In process of time the rights originating in royal grants of privilege
<span id="line5728"></span>overbalanced, as it were, folk-right in many respects, and became
<span id="line5729"></span>themselves the starting-point of a new legal system<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the feudal one.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5730"></span>
<span id="line5731"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(b) Another feature of vital importance in the history of Anglo-Saxon
<span id="line5732"></span>law is its tendency towards the preservation of peace. Society
<span id="line5733"></span>is constantly struggling to ensure the main condition of its
<span id="line5734"></span>existence<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>peace. Already in <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>AElig;</span>thelberht's legislation we find
<span id="line5735"></span>characteristic fines inflicted for breach of the peace of householders
<span id="line5736"></span>of different ranks<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the ceorl, the eorl, and the king himself
<span id="line5737"></span>appearing as the most exalted among them. Peace is considered not so
<span id="line5738"></span>much a state of equilibrium and friendly relations between parties,
<span id="line5739"></span>but rather as the rule of a third within a certain region<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>a house,
<span id="line5740"></span>an estate, a kingdom. This leads on one side to the recognition of
<span id="line5741"></span>private authorities<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the father's in his family, the master's as to
<span id="line5742"></span>servants, the lord's as to his personal or territorial dependents.
<span id="line5743"></span>On the other hand, the tendency to maintain peace naturally takes
<span id="line5744"></span>its course towards the strongest ruler, the king, and we witness in
<span id="line5745"></span>Anglo-Saxon law the gradual evolution of more and more stringent and
<span id="line5746"></span>complete rules in respect of the king's peace and its infringements.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5747"></span>
<span id="line5748"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(c) The more ancient documents of Anglo-Saxon law show us the
<span id="line5749"></span>individual not merely as the subject and citizen of a certain
<span id="line5750"></span>commonwealth, but also as a member of some group, all the fellows
<span id="line5751"></span>of which are closely allied in claims and responsibilities. The most
<span id="line5752"></span>elementary of these groups is the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>maegth</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, the association
<span id="line5753"></span>of agnatic and cognatic relations. Personal protection and revenge,
<span id="line5754"></span>oaths, marriage, wardship, succession, supervision over settlement,
<span id="line5755"></span>and good behaviour, are regulated by the law of kinship. A man's
<span id="line5756"></span>actions are considered not as exertions of his individual will, but
<span id="line5757"></span>as acts of the kindred, and all the fellows of the maegth are held
<span id="line5758"></span>responsible for them. What began as a natural alliance was used later
<span id="line5759"></span>as a means of enforcing responsibility and keeping lawless individuals
<span id="line5760"></span>in order. When the association of kinsmen failed, the voluntary
<span id="line5761"></span>associations<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>guilds<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>appeared as substitutes. The gild brothers
<span id="line5762"></span>associated in mutual defence and support, and they had to share in
<span id="line5763"></span>the payment of fines. The township and the hundred came also in for
<span id="line5764"></span>certain forms of collective responsibility, because they presented
<span id="line5765"></span>groups of people associated in their economic and legal interests.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5766"></span>
<span id="line5767"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(d) In course of time the natural associations get loosened and
<span id="line5768"></span>intermixed, and this calls forth the elaborate police legislation of
<span id="line5769"></span>the later Anglo-Saxon kings. Regulations are issued about the sale of
<span id="line5770"></span>cattle in the presence of witnesses. Enactments about the pursuit
<span id="line5771"></span>of thieves, and the calling in of warrantors to justify sales of
<span id="line5772"></span>chattels, are other expressions of the difficulties attending peaceful
<span id="line5773"></span>intercourse. Personal surety appears as a complement of and
<span id="line5774"></span>substitute for collective responsibility. The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>hlaford</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and his
<span id="line5775"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>hiredmen</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> are an institution not only of private patronage, but
<span id="line5776"></span>also of police supervision for the sake of laying hands on malefactors
<span id="line5777"></span>and suspected persons. The </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>landrica</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> assumes the same part in
<span id="line5778"></span>a territorial district. Ultimately the laws of the 10th and 11th
<span id="line5779"></span>centuries show the beginnings of the frankpledge associations, which
<span id="line5780"></span>came to act so important a part in the local police and administration
<span id="line5781"></span>of the feudal age.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line5782"></span>
<span id="line5783"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The points mentioned are not many, but, apart from their intrinsic
<span id="line5784"></span>importance in any system of law, they are, as it were, made prominent
<span id="line5785"></span>by the documents themselves, as they are constantly referred to in the
<span id="line5786"></span>latter.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line5834"></span>period of English history, language and literature which preceded the
<span id="line5835"></span>Norman Conquest. It goes back to the time of King Alfred, who seems to
<span id="line5836"></span>have frequently used the title </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>rex Anglorum Saxonum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>rex
<span id="line5837"></span>Angul-Saxonum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. The origin of this title is not quite clear. It is
<span id="line5838"></span>generally believed to have arisen from the final union of the various
<span id="line5839"></span>kingdoms under Alfred in 886. Bede (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Hist. Eccl.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> i. 15) states
<span id="line5840"></span>that the people of the more northern kingdoms (East Anglia, Mercia,
<span id="line5841"></span>Northumbria, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c.) belonged to the Angli, while those of Essex, Sussex
<span id="line5842"></span>and Wessex were sprung from the Saxons (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), and those of
<span id="line5843"></span>Kent and southern Hampshire from the Jutes (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>). Other early
<span id="line5844"></span>writers, however, do not observe these distinctions, and neither
<span id="line5845"></span>in language nor in custom do we find evidence of any appreciable
<span id="line5846"></span>differences between the two former groups, though in custom Kent
<span id="line5847"></span>presents most remarkable contrasts with the other kingdoms. Still more
<span id="line5848"></span>curious is the fact that West Saxon writers regularly speak of their
<span id="line5849"></span>own nation as a part of the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Angelcyn</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> and of their language as
<span id="line5850"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Englisc</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, while the West Saxon royal family claimed to be of the
<span id="line5851"></span>same stock as that of Bernicia. On the other hand, it is by no means
<span id="line5852"></span>impossible that the distinction drawn by Bede was based solely on the
<span id="line5853"></span>names Essex (East Seaxan), East Anglia, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c. We need not doubt that the
<span id="line5854"></span>Angli and the Saxons were different nations originally; but from the
<span id="line5855"></span>evidence at our disposal it seems likely that they had practically
<span id="line5856"></span>coalesced in very early times, perhaps even before the invasion. At
<span id="line5857"></span>all events the term </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Angli Saxones</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> seems to have first come
<span id="line5858"></span>into use on the continent, where we find it, nearly a century before
<span id="line5859"></span>Alfred's time, in the writings of Paulus Diaconus (Paul the Deacon).
<span id="line5860"></span>There can be little doubt, however, that there it was used to
<span id="line5861"></span>distinguish the Teutonic inhabitants of Britain from the Old Saxons of
<span id="line5862"></span>the continent.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line5876"></span>river Congo. Bounded on the W. by the Atlantic Ocean, it extends along
<span id="line5877"></span>the coast from the southern bank of the Congo (6<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> S., 12<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> E.) to the

<span id="line5879"></span>some 900 m. long. On the north the Congo forms for 80 m. the boundary
<span id="line5880"></span>separating Angola from the Congo Free State. The frontier thence

<span id="line5884"></span>Angola borders German South-West Africa, the frontier being drawn
<span id="line5885"></span>somewhat S. of the 17th degree of S. latitude. The area of the

<span id="line5911"></span>north of the Portuguese-German frontier. Farther north are Port
<span id="line5912"></span>Alexander, Little Fish Bay and Lobito Bay, while shallower bays are
<span id="line5913"></span>numerous. Lobito Bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to
<span id="line5914"></span>unload close inshore. The coast plain extends inland for a distance
<span id="line5915"></span>varying from 30 to 100 m. This region is in general sparsely watered
<span id="line5916"></span>and somewhat sterile. The approach to the great central plateau of
<span id="line5917"></span>Africa is marked by a series of irregular terraces. This intermediate
<span id="line5918"></span>mountain belt is covered with luxuriant vegetation. Water is fairly
<span id="line5919"></span>abundant, though in the dry season obtainable only by digging in the
<span id="line5920"></span>sandy beds of the rivers. The plateau has an altitude ranging from
<span id="line5921"></span>4000 to 6000 ft. It consists of well-watered, wide, rolling plains,
<span id="line5922"></span>and low hills with scanty vegetation. In the east the tableland falls
<span id="line5923"></span>away to the basins of the Congo and Zambezi, to the south it merges
<span id="line5924"></span>into a barren sandy desert. A large number of rivers make their way
<span id="line5925"></span>westward to the sea; they rise, mostly, in the mountain belt, and are
<span id="line5926"></span>unimportant, the only two of any size being the Kwanza and the Kunene,
<span id="line5927"></span>separately noticed. The mountain chains which form the edge of the
<span id="line5928"></span>plateau, or diversify its surface, run generally parallel to the
<span id="line5929"></span>coast, as Tala Mugongo (4400 ft.), Chella and Vissecua (5250 ft. to
<span id="line5930"></span>6500 ft.). In the district of Benguella are the highest points of the
<span id="line5931"></span>province, viz. Loviti (7780 ft.), in 12<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> 5' S., and Mt. Elonga (7550
<span id="line5932"></span>ft.). South of the Kwanza is the volcanic mountain Caculo-Cabaza (3300
<span id="line5933"></span>ft.). From the tableland the Kwango and many other streams flow north
<span id="line5934"></span>to join the Kasai (one of the largest affluents of the Congo), which
<span id="line5935"></span>in its upper course forms for fully 300 m. the boundary between Angola
<span id="line5936"></span>and the Congo State. In the south-east part of the province the rivers
<span id="line5937"></span>belong either to the Zambezi system, or, like the Okavango, drain to

<span id="line5942"></span>by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast, (3) the
<span id="line5943"></span>central plateau. The central plateau consists of ancient crystalline
<span id="line5944"></span>rocks with granites overlain by unfossiliferous sandstones and
<span id="line5945"></span>conglomerates considered to be of Palaeozoic age. The outcrops are
<span id="line5946"></span>largely hidden under laterite. The median zone is composed largely of
<span id="line5947"></span>crystalline rocks with granites and some Palaeozoic unfossiliferous
<span id="line5948"></span>rocks. The littoral zone contains the only fossiliferous strata. These
<span id="line5949"></span>are of Tertiary and Cretaceous ages, the latter rocks resting on a
<span id="line5950"></span>reddish sandstone of older date. The Cretaceous rocks of the Dombe
<span id="line5951"></span>Grande region (near Benguella) are of Albian age and belong to
<span id="line5952"></span>the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Acanthoceras mamillari</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> zone. The beds containing

<span id="line5978"></span>of the province are dense forests. In the south towards the Kunene are
<span id="line5979"></span>regions of dense thorn scrub. Rubber vines and trees are abundant, but
<span id="line5980"></span>in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the
<span id="line5981"></span>ruthless methods adopted by native collectors of rubber. The species
<span id="line5982"></span>most common are various root rubbers, notably the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Carpodinus

<span id="line5984"></span>very widely distributed. Landolphias are also found. The coffee,
<span id="line5985"></span>cotton and Guinea pepper plants are indigenous, and the tobacco plant
<span id="line5986"></span>flourishes in several districts. Among the trees are several
<span id="line5987"></span>which yield excellent timber, such as the tacula (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Pterocarpus

<span id="line6006"></span>Bangala of the middle Congo. In the Abunda is a considerable strain of
<span id="line6007"></span>Portuguese blood. The Ba-Lunda inhabit the Lunda district. Along the
<span id="line6008"></span>upper Kunene and in other districts of the plateau are settlements of
<span id="line6009"></span>Boers, the Boer population being about 2000. In the coast towns the
<span id="line6010"></span>majority of the white inhabitants are Portuguese. The Mushi-Kongo
<span id="line6011"></span>and other divisions of the Ba-Kongo retain curious traces of the
<span id="line6012"></span>Christianity professed by them in the 16th and 17th centuries and
<span id="line6013"></span>possibly later. Crucifixes are used as potent fetish charms or as
<span id="line6014"></span>symbols of power passing down from chief to chief; whilst every native
<span id="line6015"></span>has a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Santu<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or Christian name and is dubbed dom or dona.
<span id="line6016"></span>Fetishism is the prevailing religion throughout the province. The
<span id="line6017"></span>dwelling-places of the natives are usually small huts of the simplest
<span id="line6018"></span>construction, used chiefly as sleeping apartments; the day is spent in
<span id="line6019"></span>an open space in front of the hut protected from the sun by a roof of
<span id="line6020"></span>palm or other leaves.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6025"></span>its existence to the bay of the same name having been chosen as the
<span id="line6026"></span>sea terminus of a railway to the far interior. Noki is on the southern
<span id="line6027"></span>bank of the Congo at the head of navigation from the sea, and close
<span id="line6028"></span>to the Congo Free State frontier. It is available for ships of large
<span id="line6029"></span>tonnage, and through it passes the Portuguese portion of the trade of
<span id="line6030"></span>the lower Congo. Ambriz<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>the only seaport of consequence in the Congo
<span id="line6031"></span>district of the province<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>is at the mouth of the Loje river, about 70
<span id="line6032"></span>m. N. of Loanda. Novo Redondo and Egito are small ports between Loanda
<span id="line6033"></span>and Benguella. Port Alexander is in the district of Mossamedes and S.

<span id="line6047"></span>in the closing years of the 19th century and the stone used to build
<span id="line6048"></span>government offices. There is a fort, built about 1850, and a small
<span id="line6049"></span>military force is at the disposal of the Portuguese resident. Bembe
<span id="line6050"></span>and Encoje are smaller towns in the Congo district south of Sao
<span id="line6051"></span>Salvador. Bihe, the capital of the plateau district of the same
<span id="line6052"></span>name forming the hinterland of Benguella, is a large caravan centre.
<span id="line6053"></span>Kangomba, the residence of the king of Bihe, is a large town. Caconda

<span id="line6059"></span>The chief exports are coffee, rubber, wax, palm kernels and palm-oil,
<span id="line6060"></span>cattle and hides and dried or salt fish. Gold dust, cotton, ivory and
<span id="line6061"></span>gum are also exported. The chief imports are food-stuffs, cotton and
<span id="line6062"></span>woollen goods and hardware. Considerable quantities of coal come
<span id="line6063"></span>from South Wales. Oxen, introduced from Europe and from South Africa,
<span id="line6064"></span>flourish. There are sugar factories, where rum is also distilled and a
<span id="line6065"></span>few other manufactures, but the prosperity of the province depends
<span id="line6066"></span>on the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>jungle<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> products obtained through the natives and from the

<span id="line6085"></span>between Cape Town, Lobito and Lisbon and Southampton. The Portuguese
<span id="line6086"></span>line is subsidized by the government. The railway from Loanda to
<span id="line6087"></span>Ambaca and Malanje is known as the Royal Trans-African railway. It
<span id="line6088"></span>is of metre gauge, was begun in 1887 and is some 300 m. long. It was
<span id="line6089"></span>intended to carry the line across the continent to Mozambique,
<span id="line6090"></span>but when the line reached Ambaca (225 m.) in 1894 that scheme
<span id="line6091"></span>was abandoned. The railway had created a record in being the most
<span id="line6092"></span>expensive built in tropical Africa<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>pound;</span>8942 per mile. A railway from
<span id="line6093"></span>Lobito Bay, 25 m.N. of Benguella, begun in 1904, runs towards the

<span id="line6108"></span>those delegated to the governor-general, are exercised by the home
<span id="line6109"></span>government. Revenue is raised chiefly from customs, excise duties
<span id="line6110"></span>and direct taxation. The revenue (in 1904-1905 about <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>pound;</span>350,000)

<span id="line6117"></span>coast of Africa towards the close of the 15th century. The river Congo
<span id="line6118"></span>was discovered by Diogo Cam or Cao in 1482. He erected a stone pillar
<span id="line6119"></span>at the mouth of the river, which accordingly took the title of Rio
<span id="line6120"></span>de Padrao, and established friendly relations with the natives, who
<span id="line6121"></span>reported that the country was subject to a great monarch, Mwani Congo
<span id="line6122"></span>or lord of Congo, resident at Bonza Congo. The Portuguese were not
<span id="line6123"></span>long in making themselves influential in the country. Gon<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ccedil;</span>alo de Sousa
<span id="line6124"></span>was despatched on a formal embassy in 1490; and the first missionaries
<span id="line6125"></span>entered the country in his train. The king was soon afterwards
<span id="line6126"></span>baptized and Christianity was nominally established as the national
<span id="line6127"></span>religion. In 1534 a cathedral was founded at Bonza Congo (renamed Sao
<span id="line6128"></span>Salvador), and in 1560 the Jesuits arrived with Paulo Diaz de Novaes.
<span id="line6129"></span>Of the prosperity of the country the Portuguese have left the most
<span id="line6130"></span>glowing and indeed incredible accounts. It was, however, about this
<span id="line6131"></span>time ravaged by cannibal invaders (Bangala) from the interior,
<span id="line6132"></span>and Portuguese influence gradually declined. The attention of the
<span id="line6133"></span>Portuguese was, moreover, now turned more particularly to the southern
<span id="line6134"></span>districts of Angola. In 1627 the bishop's seat was removed to Sao
<span id="line6135"></span>Paulo de Loanda and Sao Salvador declined in importance. In the 18th
<span id="line6136"></span>century, in spite of hindrances from Holland and France, steps were
<span id="line6137"></span>taken towards re-establishing Portuguese authority in the northern
<span id="line6138"></span>regions; in 1758 a settlement was formed at Encoje; from 1784 to 1789
<span id="line6139"></span>the Portuguese carried on a war against the natives of Mussolo (the
<span id="line6140"></span>district immediately south of Ambriz); in 1791 they built a fort at
<span id="line6141"></span>Quincollo on the Loje, and for a time they worked the mines of
<span id="line6142"></span>Bembe. Until, however, the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>scramble for Africa<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> began in 1884, they
<span id="line6143"></span>possessed no fort or settlement on the coast to the north of Ambriz,
<span id="line6144"></span>which was first occupied in 1855. At Sao Salvador, however, the
<span id="line6145"></span>Portuguese continued to exercise influence. The last of the native
<span id="line6146"></span>princes who had real authority was a potentate known as Dom Pedro
<span id="line6147"></span>V. He was placed on the throne in 1855 with the help of a Portuguese
<span id="line6148"></span>force, and reigned over thirty years. In 1888 a Portuguese resident
<span id="line6149"></span>was stationed at Salvador, and the kings of Congo became pensioners of
<span id="line6150"></span>the government.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6151"></span>
<span id="line6152"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Angola proper, and the whole coast-line of what now constitutes the
<span id="line6153"></span>province of that name, was discovered by Diogo Cam during 1482 and
<span id="line6154"></span>the three following years. The first governor sent to Angola was Paulo
<span id="line6155"></span>Diaz, a grandson of Bartholomew Diaz, who reduced to submission the
<span id="line6156"></span>region south of the Kwanza nearly as far as Benguella. The city of
<span id="line6157"></span>Loanda was founded in 1576, Benguella in 1617. From that date the
<span id="line6158"></span>sovereignty of Portugal over the coast-line, from its present southern
<span id="line6159"></span>limit as far north as Ambriz (7<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> 50' S.) has been undisputed save
<span id="line6160"></span>between 1640 and 1648, during which time the Dutch attempted to expel
<span id="line6161"></span>the Portuguese and held possession of the ports. Whilst the economic
<span id="line6162"></span>development of the country was not entirely neglected and many useful
<span id="line6163"></span>food products were introduced, the prosperity of the province was
<span id="line6164"></span>very largely dependent on the slave trade with Brazil, which was not
<span id="line6165"></span>legally abolished until 1830 and in fact continued for many years
<span id="line6166"></span>subsequently.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6167"></span>
<span id="line6168"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In 1884 Great Britain, which up to that time had steadily refused
<span id="line6169"></span>to acknowledge that Portugal possessed territorial rights north of
<span id="line6170"></span>Ambriz, concluded a treaty recognizing Portuguese sovereignty over
<span id="line6171"></span>both banks of the lower Congo; but the treaty, meeting with opposition
<span id="line6172"></span>in England and Germany, was not ratified. Agreements concluded with
<span id="line6173"></span>the Congo Free State, Germany and France in 1885-1886 (modified in
<span id="line6174"></span>details by subsequent arrangements) fixed the limits of the province,
<span id="line6175"></span>except in the S.E., where the frontier between Barotseland (N.W.
<span id="line6176"></span>Rhodesia) and Angola was determined by an Anglo-Portuguese agreement
<span id="line6177"></span>of 1891 and the arbitration award of the king of Italy in 1905 (see
<span id="line6178"></span>AFRICA: </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>History)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. Up to the end of the 19th century the hold
<span id="line6179"></span>of Portugal over the interior of the province was slight, though its
<span id="line6180"></span>influence extended to the Congo and Zambezi basins. The abolition of
<span id="line6181"></span>the external slave trade proved very injurious to the trade of the
<span id="line6182"></span>seaports, but from 1860 onward the agricultural resources of the
<span id="line6183"></span>country were developed with increasing energy, a work in which
<span id="line6184"></span>Brazilian merchants took the lead. After the definite partition of
<span id="line6185"></span>Africa among the European powers, Portugal applied herself with some
<span id="line6186"></span>seriousness to exploit Angola and her other African possessions.
<span id="line6187"></span>Nevertheless, in comparison with its natural wealth the development
<span id="line6188"></span>of the country has been slow. Slavery and the slave trade continued
<span id="line6189"></span>to flourish in the interior in the early years of the 20th century,
<span id="line6190"></span>despite the prohibitions of the Portuguese government. The extension
<span id="line6191"></span>of authority over the inland tribes proceeded very slowly and was not
<span id="line6192"></span>accomplished without occasional reverses. Thus in September 1904 a
<span id="line6193"></span>Portuguese column lost over 300 men killed, including 114 Europeans,
<span id="line6194"></span>in an encounter with the Kunahamas on the Kunene, not far from the
<span id="line6195"></span>German frontier. The Kunahamas are a wild, raiding tribe and
<span id="line6196"></span>were probably largely influenced by the revolt of their southern
<span id="line6197"></span>neighbours, the Hereros, against the Germans. In 1905 and again in
<span id="line6198"></span>1907 there was renewed fighting in the same region.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6227"></span>capital of the vilayet of the same name, situated upon a steep, rocky
<span id="line6228"></span>hill, which rises 500 ft. above the plain, on the left bank of the
<span id="line6229"></span>Enguri Su, a tributary of the Sakaria (Sangarius), about 220 m.
<span id="line6230"></span>E.S.E. of Constantinople. The hill is crowned by the ruins of the old
<span id="line6231"></span>citadel, which add to the picturesqueness of the view; but the town
<span id="line6232"></span>is not well built, its streets being narrow and many of its houses
<span id="line6233"></span>constructed of sun-dried mud bricks; there are, however, many
<span id="line6234"></span>fine remains of Graeco-Roman and Byzantine architecture, the most
<span id="line6235"></span>remarkable being the temple of Rome and Augustus, on the walls of
<span id="line6236"></span>which is the famous </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Monumentum Ancyranum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (see ANCYRA). Ancyra
<span id="line6237"></span>was the centre of the Tectosages, one of the three Gaulish tribes
<span id="line6238"></span>which settled in Galatia in the 3rd century B.C., and became the
<span id="line6239"></span>capital of the Roman province of Galatia when it was formally
<span id="line6240"></span>constituted in 25 B.C. During the Byzantine period, throughout
<span id="line6241"></span>which it occupied a position of great importance, it was captured by
<span id="line6242"></span>Persians and Arabs; then it fell into the hands of the Seljuk Turks,
<span id="line6243"></span>was held for eighteen years by the Latin Crusaders, and finally passed
<span id="line6244"></span>to the Ottoman Turks in 1360. In 1402 a great battle was fought in the
<span id="line6245"></span>vicinity of Angora, in which the Turkish sultan Bayezid was defeated
<span id="line6246"></span>and made prisoner by the Tatar conqueror Timur. In 1415 it was
<span id="line6247"></span>recovered by the Turks under Mahommed I., and since that period has

<span id="line6249"></span>belonged to the Ottoman empire. In 1832 it was taken
<span id="line6250"></span>by the Egyptians under Ibrahim Pasha. Angora is connected with
<span id="line6251"></span>Constantinople by railway, and exports wool, mohair, grain and yellow
<span id="line6252"></span>berries. Mohair cloth is manufactured, and the town is noted for its
<span id="line6253"></span>honey and fruit. From 1639 to 1768 there was an agency of the Levant
<span id="line6254"></span>Company here; there is now a British consul. Pop. estimated at 28,000
<span id="line6255"></span>(Moslems, 18,000; Christians, largely Roman Catholic Armenians, about
<span id="line6256"></span>9400; Jews, 400).</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6260"></span>of the ancient Galatia. It is an agricultural country, depending for
<span id="line6261"></span>its prosperity on its grain, wool (average annual export, 4,400,000
<span id="line6262"></span>ft), and the mohair obtained from the beautiful Angora goats (average
<span id="line6263"></span>annual clip, 3,300,000 lb). The fineness of the hair may perhaps be
<span id="line6264"></span>ascribed to some peculiarity in the atmosphere, for it is remarkable
<span id="line6265"></span>that the cats, dogs and other animals of the country are to a certain
<span id="line6266"></span>extent affected in the same way, and that they all lose much of their
<span id="line6267"></span>distinctive beauty when taken from their native districts. The only
<span id="line6268"></span>important industry is carpet-weaving at Kir-sheher and Kaisarieh.
<span id="line6269"></span>There are mines of silver, copper, lignite and salt, and many hot

<span id="line6285"></span>Charles IX. of France and Marie Touchet, was born on the 28th of April
<span id="line6286"></span>1573, at the castle of Fayet in Dauphin<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>. His father dying in the
<span id="line6287"></span>following year, commended him to the care and favour of his brother
<span id="line6288"></span>and successor, Henry III., who faithfully fulfilled the charge. His
<span id="line6289"></span>mother married Fran<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ccedil;</span>ois de Balzac, marquis d'Entragues, and one of her
<span id="line6290"></span>daughters, Henriette, marchioness of Verneuil, afterwards became the
<span id="line6291"></span>mistress of Henry IV. Charles of Valois, was carefully educated, and
<span id="line6292"></span>was destined for the order of Malta. At the early age of sixteen he
<span id="line6293"></span>attained one of the highest dignities of the order, being made grand
<span id="line6294"></span>prior of France. Shortly after he came into possession of large
<span id="line6295"></span>estates left by Catherine de' Medici, from one of which he took his
<span id="line6296"></span>title of count of Auvergne. In 1591 he obtained a dispensation from
<span id="line6297"></span>the vows of the order of Malta, and married Charlotte, daughter of
<span id="line6298"></span>Henry, Marshal d'Amville, afterwards duke of Montmorency. In 1589
<span id="line6299"></span>Henry III. was assassinated, but on his deathbed he commended Charles
<span id="line6300"></span>to the good-will of his successor Henry IV. By that monarch he was
<span id="line6301"></span>made colonel of horse, and in that capacity served in the campaigns
<span id="line6302"></span>during the early part of the reign. But the connexion between the king
<span id="line6303"></span>and the marchioness of Verneuil appears to have been very displeasing
<span id="line6304"></span>to Auvergne, and in 1601 he engaged in the conspiracy formed by the
<span id="line6305"></span>dukes of Savoy, Biron and Bouillon, one of the objects of which was
<span id="line6306"></span>to force Henry to repudiate his wife and marry the marchioness. The
<span id="line6307"></span>conspiracy was discovered; Biron and Auvergne were arrested and Biron
<span id="line6308"></span>was executed. Auvergne after a few months' imprisonment was released,
<span id="line6309"></span>chiefly through the influence of his half-sister, his aunt, the
<span id="line6310"></span>duchess of Angouleme and his father-in-law. He then entered into
<span id="line6311"></span>fresh intrigues with the court of Spain, acting in concert with
<span id="line6312"></span>the marchioness of Verneuil and her father d'Entragues. In 1604
<span id="line6313"></span>d'Entragues and he were arrested and condemned to death; at the same
<span id="line6314"></span>time the marchioness was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in a
<span id="line6315"></span>convent. She easily obtained pardon, and the sentence of death against
<span id="line6316"></span>the other two was commuted into perpetual imprisonment. Auvergne
<span id="line6317"></span>remained in the Bastille for eleven years, from 1605 to 1616. A decree
<span id="line6318"></span>of the parlement (1606), obtained by Marguerite de Valois, deprived
<span id="line6319"></span>him of nearly all his possessions, including Auvergne, though he still
<span id="line6320"></span>retained the title. In 1616 he was released, was restored to his
<span id="line6321"></span>rank of colonel-general of horse, and despatched against one of the
<span id="line6322"></span>disaffected nobles, the duke of Longueville, who had taken P<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>ronne.
<span id="line6323"></span>Next year he commanded the forces collected in the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>Icirc;</span>le de France, and
<span id="line6324"></span>obtained some successes. In 1619 he received by bequest, ratified in
<span id="line6325"></span>1620 by royal grant, the duchy of Angoul<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>me. Soon after he was engaged
<span id="line6326"></span>on an important embassy to Germany, the result of which was the
<span id="line6327"></span>treaty of Ulm, signed July 1620. In 1627 he commanded the large forces
<span id="line6328"></span>assembled at the siege of La Rochelle; and some years after in 1635,
<span id="line6329"></span>during the Thirty Years' War, he was general of the French army in
<span id="line6330"></span>Lorraine. In 1636 he was made lieutenant-general of the army. He
<span id="line6331"></span>appears to have retired from public life shortly after the death of
<span id="line6332"></span>Richelieu in 1643. His first wife died in 1636, and in 1644 he married
<span id="line6333"></span>Francoise de Narbonne, daughter of Charles, baron of Mareuil. She had
<span id="line6334"></span>no children and survived her husband until 1713. Angouleme himself
<span id="line6335"></span>died on the 24th of September 1650. By his first wife he had three
<span id="line6336"></span>children: Henri, who became insane; Louis Emmanuel, who succeeded his
<span id="line6337"></span>father as duke of Angoul<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>me and was colonel-general of light cavalry
<span id="line6338"></span>and governor of Provence; and Fran<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ccedil;</span>oise, who died in 1622.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6359"></span>and west by the Anguienne, a small tributary of that river. The more

<span id="line6368"></span>de ville, the architecture is of little interest. The cathedral of
<span id="line6369"></span>St. Pierre (see CATHEDRAL), a church in the Byzantine-Romanesque style,
<span id="line6370"></span>dates from the 11th and 12th centuries, but has undergone frequent
<span id="line6371"></span>restoration, and was partly rebuilt in the latter half of the igth

<span id="line6374"></span>and sculpture, the whole representing the Last Judgment. The crossing
<span id="line6375"></span>is surmounted by a dome, and the extremity of the north transept by
<span id="line6376"></span>a fine square tower over 160 ft. high. The h<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ocirc;</span>tel de ville, also by

<span id="line6378"></span>the chateau of the counts of Angoul<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>me, on the site of which it is
<span id="line6379"></span>built. It contains museums of paintings and archaeology. Angoul<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>me is
<span id="line6380"></span>the seat of a bishop, a prefect, and a court of assizes. Its public
<span id="line6381"></span>institutions include tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a

<span id="line6384"></span>of artillery, a library and several learned societies. It is a centre
<span id="line6385"></span>of the paper-making industry, with which the town has been connected
<span id="line6386"></span>since the 14th century. Most of the mills are situated on the banks
<span id="line6387"></span>of the watercourses in the neighbourhood of the town. The subsidiary
<span id="line6388"></span>industries, such as the manufacture of machinery and wire fabric,
<span id="line6389"></span>are of considerable importance. Iron and copper founding, brewing,
<span id="line6390"></span>tanning, and the manufacture of gunpowder, confectionery, heavy iron

<span id="line6410"></span>passed to the Lusignan family, counts of Marche. On the death of Hugh

<span id="line6483"></span>at Upsala University, where in 1839 he became </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>privat docent</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6484"></span>in physics. In 1842 he went to Stockholm Observatory in order to gain
<span id="line6485"></span>experience in practical astronomical work, and in the following year
<span id="line6486"></span>ht became observer at Upsala Observatory. Becoming interested in
<span id="line6487"></span>terrestrial magnetism he made many observations of magnetic intensity
<span id="line6488"></span>and declination in various parts of Sweden, and was charged by the
<span id="line6489"></span>Stockholm Academy of Sciences with the task, not completed till
<span id="line6490"></span>shortly before his death, of working out the magnetic data obtained
<span id="line6491"></span>by the Swedish frigate <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Eug<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>nie<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> on her voyage round the world in
<span id="line6492"></span>1851-1853. In 1858 he succeeded Adolph Ferdinand Svanberg (1806-1857)
<span id="line6493"></span>in the chair of physics at Upsala, and there he died on the 21st of
<span id="line6494"></span>June 1874. His most important work was concerned with the conduction
<span id="line6495"></span>of heat and with spectroscopy. In his optical researches, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Optiska
<span id="line6496"></span>Unders<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>kningar,</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> presented to the Stockholm Academy in 1853, he
<span id="line6497"></span>not only pointed out that the electric spark yields two superposed
<span id="line6498"></span>spectra, one from the metal of the electrode and the other from the
<span id="line6499"></span>gas in which it passes, but deduced from Euler's theory of
<span id="line6500"></span>resonance that an incandescent gas emits luminous rays of the same
<span id="line6501"></span>refrangibility as those which it can absorb. This statement, as Sir
<span id="line6502"></span>E. Sabine remarked when awarding him the Rumford medal of the
<span id="line6503"></span>Royal Society in 1872, contains a fundamental principle of spectrum
<span id="line6504"></span>analysis, and though for a number of years it was overlooked it
<span id="line6505"></span>entitles him to rank as one of the founders of spectroscopy. From 1861
<span id="line6506"></span>onwards he paid special attention to the solar spectrum. He announced
<span id="line6507"></span>the existence of hydrogen, among other elements, in the sun's
<span id="line6508"></span>atmosphere in 1862, and in 1868 published his great map of the normal
<span id="line6509"></span>solar spectrum which long remained authoritative in questions of
<span id="line6510"></span>wave-length, although his measurements were inexact to the extent
<span id="line6511"></span>of one part in 7000 or 8000 owing to the metre which he used as his
<span id="line6512"></span>standard having been slightly too short. He was the first, in 1867, to
<span id="line6513"></span>examine the spectrum of the aurora borealis, and detected and measured
<span id="line6514"></span>the characteristic bright line in its yellow green region; but he was
<span id="line6515"></span>mistaken in supposing that this same line, which is often called by
<span id="line6516"></span>his name, is also to be seen in the zodiacal light.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6522"></span>returned to Upsala, where in 1896 he became professor of physics. He

<span id="line6602"></span>favourites to be hanged. Subsequently he joined Alexander Stewart,
<span id="line6603"></span>duke of Albany, in league with Edward IV. of England on the 11th
<span id="line6604"></span>of February 1483, signing the convention at Westminster which
<span id="line6605"></span>acknowledged the overlordship of the English king. In March however
<span id="line6606"></span>they returned, outwardly at least, to their allegiance, and received
<span id="line6607"></span>pardons for their treason. Later Angus was one of the leaders in the
<span id="line6608"></span>rebellion against James in 1487 and 1488, which ended in the latter's

<span id="line6610"></span>but soon lost influence, being superseded by the Homes and Hepburns,
<span id="line6611"></span>and the wardenship of the marches was given to Alexander Home. Though
<span id="line6612"></span>outwardly on good terms with James, he treacherously made a treaty
<span id="line6613"></span>with Henry VII. about 1489 or 1491, by which he undertook to govern

<span id="line6616"></span>into Scotland, on the condition of receiving English estates in
<span id="line6617"></span>compensation. In October 1491 he fortified his castle of Tantallon
<span id="line6618"></span>against James, but was obliged to submit and exchange his Liddesdale
<span id="line6619"></span>estate and Hermitage Castle for the lordship of Bothwell. In 1493 he
<span id="line6620"></span>was again in favour, received various grants of lands, and was made
<span id="line6621"></span>chancellor, which office he retained till 1498. In 1501 he was once
<span id="line6622"></span>more in disgrace and confined to Dumbarton Castle. After the disaster
<span id="line6623"></span>at Flodden in 1513, at which he was not present, but at which he lost
<span id="line6624"></span>his two eldest sons, Angus was appointed one of the counsellors of the
<span id="line6625"></span>queen regent. He died at the close of this year, or in 1514. He was
<span id="line6626"></span>married three times, and by his first wife had four sons and several
<span id="line6627"></span>daughters. His third son, Gavin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, is
<span id="line6628"></span>separately noticed.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6630"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>ARCHIBALD DOUGLAS, the 6th earl (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>c.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> 1489-1557), son of George,
<span id="line6631"></span>master of Douglas, who was killed at Flodden, succeeded on his
<span id="line6632"></span>grandfather's death. In 1509 he had married Margaret (d. 1513),
<span id="line6633"></span>daughter of Patrick Hepburn, 1st earl of Bothwell; and in 1514 he
<span id="line6634"></span>married the queen dowager Margaret of Scotland, widow of James IV.,
<span id="line6635"></span>and eldest sister of Henry VIII. By this latter act he stirred up the
<span id="line6636"></span>jealousy of the nobles and the opposition of the French party, and
<span id="line6637"></span>civil war broke out. He was superseded in the government on the
<span id="line6638"></span>arrival of John Stewart, duke of Albany, who was made regent. Angus
<span id="line6639"></span>withdrew to his estates in Forfarshire, while Albany besieged the
<span id="line6640"></span>queen at Stirling and got possession of the royal children; then he
<span id="line6641"></span>joined Margaret after her flight at Morpeth, and on her departure for
<span id="line6642"></span>London returned and made his peace with Albany in 1516. He met her
<span id="line6643"></span>once more at Berwick in June 1517, when Margaret returned to Scotland
<span id="line6644"></span>on Albany's departure in vain hopes of regaining the regency.
<span id="line6645"></span>Meanwhile, during Margaret's absence, Angus had formed a connexion
<span id="line6646"></span>with a daughter of the laird of Traquair. Margaret avenged his neglect
<span id="line6647"></span>of her by refusing to support his claims for power and by secretly
<span id="line6648"></span>trying through Albany to get a divorce. In Edinburgh Angus held his
<span id="line6649"></span>own against the attempts of James Hamilton, 1st earl of Arran, to
<span id="line6650"></span>dislodge him. But the return of Albany in 1521, with whom Margaret now
<span id="line6651"></span>sided against her husband, deprived him of power. The regent took the
<span id="line6652"></span>government into his own hands; Angus was charged with high treason in
<span id="line6653"></span>December, and in March 1522 was sent practically a prisoner to France,
<span id="line6654"></span>whence he succeeded in escaping to London in 1524. He returned to
<span id="line6655"></span>Scotland in November with promises of support from Henry VIII., with
<span id="line6656"></span>whom he made a close alliance. Margaret, however, refused to have
<span id="line6657"></span>anything to do with her husband. On the 23rd, therefore, Angus forced
<span id="line6658"></span>his way into Edinburgh, but was fired upon by Margaret and retreated
<span id="line6659"></span>to Tantallon. He now organized a large party of nobles against
<span id="line6660"></span>Margaret with the support of Henry VIII., and in February 1525 they
<span id="line6661"></span>entered Edinburgh and called a parliament. Angus was made a lord of
<span id="line6662"></span>the articles, was included in the council of regency, bore the king's
<span id="line6663"></span>crown on the opening of the session, and with Archbishop Beaton held
<span id="line6664"></span>the chief power. In March he was appointed lieutenant of the marches,
<span id="line6665"></span>and suppressed the disorder and anarchy on the border. In July the
<span id="line6666"></span>guardianship of the king was entrusted to him for a fixed period
<span id="line6667"></span>till the 1st of November, but he refused at its close to retire, and
<span id="line6668"></span>advancing to Linlithgow put to flight Margaret and his opponents. He
<span id="line6669"></span>now with his followers engrossed all the power, succeeded in gaining
<span id="line6670"></span>over some of his antagonists, including Arran and the Hamiltons,
<span id="line6671"></span>and filled the public offices with Douglases, he himself becoming
<span id="line6672"></span>chancellor. <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>None that time durst strive against a Douglas nor

<span id="line6674"></span>content under the tutelage of Angus, but he was closely guarded,
<span id="line6675"></span>and several attempts to effect his liberation were prevented, Angus
<span id="line6676"></span>completely defeating Lennox, who had advanced towards Edinburgh with
<span id="line6677"></span>10,000 men in August, and subsequently taking Stirling. His successes
<span id="line6678"></span>were consummated by a pacification with Beaton, and in 1527 and 1528
<span id="line6679"></span>he was busy in restoring order through the country. In the latter
<span id="line6680"></span>year, on the 11th of March, Margaret succeeded in obtaining her
<span id="line6681"></span>divorce from Angus, and about the end of the month she and her lover,
<span id="line6682"></span>Henry Stewart, were besieged at Stirling. A few weeks later, however,
<span id="line6683"></span>James succeeded in escaping from Angus's custody, took refuge with
<span id="line6684"></span>Margaret and Arran at Stirling, and immediately proscribed Angus and
<span id="line6685"></span>all the Douglases, forbidding them to come within seven miles of his
<span id="line6686"></span>person. Angus, having fortified himself in Tantallon, was attainted
<span id="line6687"></span>and his lands confiscated. Repeated attempts of James to subdue
<span id="line6688"></span>the fortress failed, and on one occasion Angus captured the royal
<span id="line6689"></span>artillery, but at length it was given up as a condition of the truce
<span id="line6690"></span>between England and Scotland, and in May 1529 Angus took refuge
<span id="line6691"></span>with Henry, obtained a pension and took an oath of allegiance, Henry
<span id="line6692"></span>engaging to make his restoration a condition of peace. Angus had
<span id="line6693"></span>been chiefly guided in his intrigues with England by his brother, Sir
<span id="line6694"></span>George Douglas of Pittendriech (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>d.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> 1552), master of Angus, a
<span id="line6695"></span>far cleverer diplomatist than himself. His life and lands were also
<span id="line6696"></span>declared forfeit, as were those of his uncle, Archibald Douglas of
<span id="line6697"></span>Kilspindie (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>d.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> 1535), who had been a friend of James and was
<span id="line6698"></span>known by the nickname of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Greysteel.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> These took refuge in exile.
<span id="line6699"></span>James avenged himself on such Douglases as lay within his power.
<span id="line6700"></span>Angus's third sister Janet, Lady Glamis, was summoned to answer the
<span id="line6701"></span>charge of communicating with her brothers, and on her failure
<span id="line6702"></span>to appear her estates were forfeited. In 1537 she was tried for
<span id="line6703"></span>conspiring against the king's life. She was found guilty and burnt on
<span id="line6704"></span>the Castle Hill, Edinburgh, on the 17th of July 1537. Her innocence

<span id="line6707"></span>Scotland</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, iv. pp. 433, 434) considered her guilty. Angus remained
<span id="line6708"></span>in England till 1542, joining in the attacks upon his countrymen on
<span id="line6709"></span>the border, while James refused all demands from Henry VIII. for
<span id="line6710"></span>his restoration, and kept firm to his policy of suppressing and
<span id="line6711"></span>extirpating the Douglas faction. On James V.'s death in 1542 Angus
<span id="line6712"></span>returned to Scotland, with instructions from Henry to accomplish the
<span id="line6713"></span>marriage between Mary and Edward. His forfeiture was rescinded,
<span id="line6714"></span>his estates restored, and he was made a privy councillor and
<span id="line6715"></span>lieutenant-general. In 1543 he negotiated the treaty of peace and
<span id="line6716"></span>marriage, and the same year he himself married Margaret, daughter of
<span id="line6717"></span>Robert, Lord Maxwell. Shortly afterwards strife between Angus and the
<span id="line6718"></span>regent Arran broke out, and in April 1544 Angus was taken prisoner.
<span id="line6719"></span>The same year Lord Hertford's marauding expedition, which did not
<span id="line6720"></span>spare the lands of Angus, made him join the anti-English party. He
<span id="line6721"></span>entered into a bond with Arran and others to maintain their allegiance
<span id="line6722"></span>to Mary, and gave his support to the mission sent to France to offer
<span id="line6723"></span>the latter's hand. In July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the
<span id="line6724"></span>south of Scotland, and distinguished himself on the 27th of February
<span id="line6725"></span>1545 in the victory over the English at Ancrum Moor. He still
<span id="line6726"></span>corresponded with Henry VIII., but nevertheless signed in 1546 the act
<span id="line6727"></span>cancelling the marriage and peace treaty, and on the 10th of September
<span id="line6728"></span>commanded the van in the great defeat of Pinkie, when he again won
<span id="line6729"></span>fame. In 1548 the attempt by Lennox and Wharton to capture him and
<span id="line6730"></span>punish him for his duplicity failed, Angus escaping after his defeat
<span id="line6731"></span>to Edinburgh by sea, and Wharton being driven back to Carlisle. Under
<span id="line6732"></span>the regency of Mary of Lorraine his restless and ambitious character
<span id="line6733"></span>and the number of his retainers gave cause for frequent alarms to
<span id="line6734"></span>the government. On the 31st of August 1547 he resigned his earldom,
<span id="line6735"></span>obtaining a regrant </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>sibi et suis haeredibus masculis et suis
<span id="line6736"></span>assignatis quibuscumque</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. His career was a long struggle for power
<span id="line6737"></span>and for the interests of his family, to which national considerations
<span id="line6738"></span>were completely subordinate. He died in January 1557. By Margaret
<span id="line6739"></span>Tudor he had Margaret, his only surviving legitimate child, who
<span id="line6740"></span>married Matthew, 4th earl of Lennox, and was mother of Lord Darnley.
<span id="line6741"></span>He was succeeded by his nephew David, son of Sir George Douglas of
<span id="line6742"></span>Pittendriech.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6745"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>ARCHIBALD DOUGLAS, 8th earl, and earl of Morton (1555-1588), was the
<span id="line6746"></span>son of David, 7th earl. He succeeded to the title and estates in 1558,
<span id="line6747"></span>being brought up by his uncle, the 4th earl of Morton, a Presbyterian.
<span id="line6748"></span>In 1573 he was made a privy councillor and sheriff of Berwick, in 1574
<span id="line6749"></span>lieutenant-general of Scotland, in 1577 warden of the west marches and
<span id="line6750"></span>steward of Fife, and in 1578 lieutenant-general of the realm. He gave
<span id="line6751"></span>a strong support to Morton during the attack upon the latter, made a
<span id="line6752"></span>vain attempt to rescue him, and was declared guilty of high treason
<span id="line6753"></span>on the 2nd of June 1581. He now entered into correspondence with the
<span id="line6754"></span>English government for an invasion of Scotland to rescue Morton,
<span id="line6755"></span>and on the latter's execution in June went to London, where he
<span id="line6756"></span>was welcomed by Elizabeth. After the raid of Ruthven in 1582 Angus
<span id="line6757"></span>returned to Scotland and was reconciled to James, but soon afterwards
<span id="line6758"></span>the king shook off the control of the earls of Mar and Gowrie,
<span id="line6759"></span>and Angus was again banished from the court. In 1584 he joined
<span id="line6760"></span>the rebellion of Mar and Glamis, but the movement failed, and the
<span id="line6761"></span>insurgents fled to Berwick. Later they took up their residence at
<span id="line6762"></span>Newcastle, which became a centre of Presbyterianism and of projects
<span id="line6763"></span>against the Scottish government, encouraged by Elizabeth, who regarded
<span id="line6764"></span>the banished lords as friends of the English and antagonists of the
<span id="line6765"></span>French interest. In February 1585 they came to London, and cleared
<span id="line6766"></span>themselves of the accusation of plotting against James's life; a plan
<span id="line6767"></span>was prepared for their restoration and for the overthrow of James
<span id="line6768"></span>Stewart, earl of Arran. In October they invaded Scotland and gained
<span id="line6769"></span>an easy victory over Arran, captured Stirling Castle with the king in
<span id="line6770"></span>November, and secured from James the restoration of their estates and
<span id="line6771"></span>the control of the government. In 1586 Angus was appointed warden of
<span id="line6772"></span>the marches and lieutenant-general on the border, and performed good
<span id="line6773"></span>services in restoring order; but he was unable to overcome the king's
<span id="line6774"></span>hostility to the establishment of Presbyterian government. In January
<span id="line6775"></span>1586 he was granted the earldom of Morton with the lands entailed upon
<span id="line6776"></span>him by his uncle. He died on the 4th of August 1588. He was succeeded
<span id="line6777"></span>in the earldom by his cousin William, a descendant of the 5th earl.

<span id="line6780"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>WILLIAM DOUGLAS, 10th earl (c. 1554-1611), was the son of William, the
<span id="line6781"></span>9th earl (1533-1591). He studied at St. Andrews University and joined
<span id="line6782"></span>the household of the earl of Morton. Subsequently, while visiting the
<span id="line6783"></span>French court, he became a Roman Catholic, and was in consequence, on
<span id="line6784"></span>his return, disinherited and placed under restraint. Nevertheless he
<span id="line6785"></span>succeeded to his father's titles and estates in 1591, and though in
<span id="line6786"></span>1592 he was disgraced for his complicity in Lord Bothwell's plot,
<span id="line6787"></span>he was soon liberated and performed useful services as the king's
<span id="line6788"></span>lieutenant in the north of Scotland. In July 1592, however, he was
<span id="line6789"></span>asking for help from Elizabeth in a plot with Erroll and other lords
<span id="line6790"></span>against Sir John Maitland, the chancellor, and protesting his absolute
<span id="line6791"></span>rejection of Spanish offers, while in October he signed the Spanish
<span id="line6792"></span>Blanks (see ERROLL, FRANCIS HAY, 9th EARL OF) and was imprisoned (on
<span id="line6793"></span>the discovery of the treason) in Edinburgh Castle on his return in
<span id="line6794"></span>January 1593. He succeeded on the 13th in escaping by the help of his
<span id="line6795"></span>countess, joining the earls of Huntly and Erroll in the north.
<span id="line6796"></span>They were offered an act of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>oblivion<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> or <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>abolition<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> provided
<span id="line6797"></span>they renounced their religion or quitted Scotland. Declining these
<span id="line6798"></span>conditions they were declared traitors and <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>forfeited.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> They remained
<span id="line6799"></span>in rebellion, and in July 1594 an attack made by them on Aberdeen
<span id="line6800"></span>roused James's anger. Huntly and Erroll were subdued by James himself
<span id="line6801"></span>in the north, and Angus failed in an attempt upon Edinburgh in concert
<span id="line6802"></span>with the earl of Bothwell. Subsequently in 1597 they all renounced
<span id="line6803"></span>their religion, declared themselves Presbyterians, and were restored
<span id="line6804"></span>to their estates and honours. Angus was again included in the privy
<span id="line6805"></span>council, and in June 1598 was appointed the king's lieutenant
<span id="line6806"></span>in southern Scotland, in which capacity he showed great zeal and
<span id="line6807"></span>conducted the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Raid of Dumfries,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> as the campaign against the
<span id="line6808"></span>Johnstones was called. Not long afterwards, Angus, offended at the
<span id="line6809"></span>advancement of Huntly to a marquisate, recanted, resisted all the
<span id="line6810"></span>arguments of the ministers to bring him to a <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>better mind,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and was
<span id="line6811"></span>again excommunicated in 1608. In 1609 he withdrew to France, and
<span id="line6812"></span>died in Paris on the 3rd of March 1611. He was succeeded by his son
<span id="line6813"></span>William, as 11th earl of Angus, afterwards 1st marquis of Douglas
<span id="line6814"></span>(1580-1660). The title is now held by the dukes of Hamilton.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6840"></span>empire, formed, in 1863, by the amalgamation of the two duchies
<span id="line6841"></span>Anhalt-Dessau-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then and Anhalt-Bernburg, and comprising all the
<span id="line6842"></span>various Anhalt territories which were sundered apart in 1603. The
<span id="line6843"></span>country now known as Anhalt consists of two larger portions<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Eastern
<span id="line6844"></span>and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part
<span id="line6845"></span>of Prussian Saxony<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>and of five enclaves surrounded by Prussian
<span id="line6846"></span>territory, viz. Alsleben, M<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>uuml;</span>hlingen, Dornburg, G<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>dnitz and
<span id="line6847"></span>Tilkerode-Abberode. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy
<span id="line6848"></span>is enclosed by the Prussian government district of Potsdam (in
<span id="line6849"></span>the Prussian province of Brandenburg), and Magdeburg and Merseburg
<span id="line6850"></span>(belonging to the Prussian province of Saxony). The western
<span id="line6851"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0045</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0045</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0045]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6852"></span> or smaller portion (the so-called Upper Duchy or
<span id="line6853"></span>Ballenstedt) is also enclosed by the two latter districts and, for a
<span id="line6854"></span>distance of 5 m. on the west, by the duchy of Brunswick. The western
<span id="line6855"></span>portion of the territory is undulating and in the extreme south-west,
<span id="line6856"></span>where it forms part of the Harz range, mountainous, the Ramberg
<span id="line6857"></span>peak attaining a height of 1900 ft. From the Harz the country gently
<span id="line6858"></span>shelves down to the Saale; and between this river and the Elbe there
<span id="line6859"></span>lies a fine tract of fertile country. The portion of the duchy lying
<span id="line6860"></span>east of the Elbe is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive pine
<span id="line6861"></span>forests, though interspersed, at intervals, by bog-land and rich
<span id="line6862"></span>pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, and intersecting the eastern
<span id="line6863"></span>portion of the duchy, from east to west, receives at Rosslau the
<span id="line6864"></span>waters of the Mulde. The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction
<span id="line6865"></span>through the western portion of the eastern part of the territory and
<span id="line6866"></span>receives, on the right, the Fuhne and, on the left, the Wipper and the
<span id="line6867"></span>Bode. The climate is on the whole mild, though somewhat inclement in
<span id="line6868"></span>the higher regions to the south-west. The area of the duchy is 906 sq.
<span id="line6869"></span>m., and the population in 1905 amounted to 328,007, a ratio of about
<span id="line6870"></span>351 to the square mile. The country is divided into the districts of
<span id="line6871"></span>Dessau, C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then, Zerbst, Bernburg and Ballenstedt, of which that of
<span id="line6872"></span>Bernburg is the most, and that of Ballenstedt the least, populated.
<span id="line6873"></span>Of the towns, four, viz. Dessau, Bernburg, C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then and Zerbst, have
<span id="line6874"></span>populations exceeding 20,000. The inhabitants of the duchy, who mainly
<span id="line6875"></span>belong to the upper Saxon race, are, with the exception of about
<span id="line6876"></span>12,000 Roman Catholics and 1700 Jews, members of the Evangelical
<span id="line6877"></span>(Union) Church. The supreme ecclesiastical authority is the consistory
<span id="line6878"></span>in Dessau; while a synod of 39 members, elected for six years,
<span id="line6879"></span>assembles at periods to deliberate on internal matters touching the
<span id="line6880"></span>organization of the church. The Roman Catholics are under the
<span id="line6881"></span>bishop of Paderborn. There are within the duchy four grammar schools
<span id="line6882"></span>(gymnasia), five semi-classical and modern schools, a teachers'
<span id="line6883"></span>seminary and four high-grade girls' schools. Of the whole surface,
<span id="line6884"></span>land under tillage amounts to about 60, meadowland to 7 and forest to
<span id="line6885"></span>25%. The chief crops are corn (especially wheat), fruit, vegetables,
<span id="line6886"></span>potatoes, beet, tobacco, flax, linseed and hops. The land is well
<span id="line6887"></span>cultivated, and the husbandry on the royal domains and the large
<span id="line6888"></span>estates especially so. The pastures on the banks of the Elbe yield
<span id="line6889"></span>cattle of excellent quality. The forests are well stocked with game,
<span id="line6890"></span>such as deer and wild boar, and the open country is well supplied
<span id="line6891"></span>with partridges. The rivers yield abundant fish, salmon (in the Elbe),
<span id="line6892"></span>sturgeon and lampreys. The country is rich in lignite, and salt works
<span id="line6893"></span>are abundant. Of the manufactures of Anhalt, the chief are its sugar
<span id="line6894"></span>factories, distilleries, breweries and chemical works. Commerce is
<span id="line6895"></span>brisk, especially in raw products<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>corn, cattle, timber or wool. Coal
<span id="line6896"></span>(lignite), guano, oil and bricks are also articles of export.
<span id="line6897"></span>The trade of the country is furthered by its excellent roads, its
<span id="line6898"></span>navigable rivers and its railways (165 m.), which are worked in
<span id="line6899"></span>connexion with the Prussian system. There is a chamber of commerce in
<span id="line6900"></span>Dessau.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6903"></span>proclaimed on the 17th of September 1859 and subsequently modified by
<span id="line6904"></span>various decrees, is a constitutional monarchy. The duke, who bears
<span id="line6905"></span>the title of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Highness,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> wields the executive power while sharing the
<span id="line6906"></span>legislation with the estates. The diet (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Landtag</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is composed of
<span id="line6907"></span>thirty-six members, of whom two are appointed by the duke, eight are
<span id="line6908"></span>representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two of the
<span id="line6909"></span>highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes,
<span id="line6910"></span>fourteen of the other electors of the towns and ten of the rural
<span id="line6911"></span>districts. The representatives are chosen for six years by indirect
<span id="line6912"></span>vote and must have completed their twenty-fifth year. The duke
<span id="line6913"></span>governs through a minister of state, who is the praeses of all the
<span id="line6914"></span>departments<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>finance, home affairs, education, public worship and
<span id="line6915"></span>statistics. The budget estimates for the financial year 1905-1906
<span id="line6916"></span>placed the expenditure of the estate at <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>pound;</span>1,323,437. The public debt
<span id="line6917"></span>amounted on the 30th of June 1904 to <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>pound;</span>226,300. By convention with
<span id="line6918"></span>Prussia of 1867 the Anhalt troops form a contingent of the Prussian
<span id="line6919"></span>army. Appeal from the lower courts of the duchy lies to the appeal
<span id="line6920"></span>court at Naumburg in Prussian Saxony.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line6923"></span>was included in the duchy of Saxony, and in the 12th century it came
<span id="line6924"></span>under the rule of Albert the Bear, margrave of Brandenburg. Albert was
<span id="line6925"></span>descended from Albert, count of Ballenstedt, whose son Esico (d. 1059
<span id="line6926"></span>or 1060) appears to have been the first to bear the title of count of
<span id="line6927"></span>Anhalt. Esico's grandson, Otto the Rich, count of Ballenstedt, was the
<span id="line6928"></span>father of Albert the Bear, by whom Anhalt was united with the mark of
<span id="line6929"></span>Brandenburg. When Albert died in 1170, his son Bernard, who received
<span id="line6930"></span>the title of duke of Saxony in 1180, became count of Anhalt. Bernard
<span id="line6931"></span>died in 1212, and Anhalt, separated from Saxony, passed to his son
<span id="line6932"></span>Henry, who in 1218 took the title of prince and was the real founder
<span id="line6933"></span>of the house of Anhalt. On Henry's death in 1252 his three sons
<span id="line6934"></span>partitioned the principality and founded respectively the lines of
<span id="line6935"></span>Aschersleben, Bernburg and Zerbst. The family ruling in Aschersleben
<span id="line6936"></span>became extinct in 1315, and this district was subsequently
<span id="line6937"></span>incorporated with the neighbouring bishopric of Halberstadt. The last
<span id="line6938"></span>prince of the line of Anhalt-Bernburg died in 1468 and his lands
<span id="line6939"></span>were inherited by the princes of the sole remaining line, that of
<span id="line6940"></span>Anhalt-Zerbst. The territory belonging to this branch of the family
<span id="line6941"></span>had been divided in 1396, and after the acquisition of Bernburg
<span id="line6942"></span>Prince George I. made a further partition of Zerbst. Early in the 16th
<span id="line6943"></span>century, however, owing to the death or abdication of several
<span id="line6944"></span>princes, the family had become narrowed down to the two branches
<span id="line6945"></span>of Anhalt-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then and Anhalt-Dessau. Wolfgang, who became prince of
<span id="line6946"></span>Anhalt-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then in 1508, was a stalwart adherent of the Reformation,
<span id="line6947"></span>and after the battle of M<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>uuml;</span>hlberg in 1547 was placed under the ban and
<span id="line6948"></span>deprived of his lands by the emperor Charles V. After the peace
<span id="line6949"></span>of Passau in 1552 he bought back his principality, but as he was
<span id="line6950"></span>childless he surrendered it in 1562 to his kinsmen the princes of
<span id="line6951"></span>Anhalt-Dessau. Ernest I. of Anhalt-Dessau (d. 1516) left three sons,
<span id="line6952"></span>John II., George III., and Joachim, who ruled their lands together
<span id="line6953"></span>for many years, and who, like Prince Wolfgang, favoured the reformed
<span id="line6954"></span>doctrines, which thus became dominant in Anhalt. About 1546 the three
<span id="line6955"></span>brothers divided their principality and founded the lines of Zerbst,
<span id="line6956"></span>Pl<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>tzkau and Dessau. This division, however, was only temporary, as
<span id="line6957"></span>the acquisition of C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then, and a series of deaths among the ruling
<span id="line6958"></span>princes, enabled Joachim Ernest, a son of John II., to unite the whole
<span id="line6959"></span>of Anhalt under his rule in 1570.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6960"></span>
<span id="line6961"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Joachim Ernest died in 1586 and his five sons ruled the land in common
<span id="line6962"></span>until 1603, when Anhalt was again divided, and the lines of Dessau,
<span id="line6963"></span>Bernburg, Pl<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>tzkau, Zerbst and C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then were refounded. The principality
<span id="line6964"></span>was ravaged during the Thirty Years' War, and in the earlier part of
<span id="line6965"></span>this struggle Christian I. of Anhalt-Bernburg took an important part.
<span id="line6966"></span>In 1635 an arrangement was made by the various princes of Anhalt,
<span id="line6967"></span>which gave a certain authority to the eldest member of the family,
<span id="line6968"></span>who was thus able to represent the principality as a whole. This
<span id="line6969"></span>proceeding was probably due to the necessity of maintaining an
<span id="line6970"></span>appearance of unity in view of the disturbed state of European
<span id="line6971"></span>politics. In 1665 the branch of Anhalt-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then became extinct, and
<span id="line6972"></span>according to a family compact this district was inherited by Lebrecht
<span id="line6973"></span>of Anhalt-Pl<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>tzkau, who surrendered Pl<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>tzkau to Bernburg, and took
<span id="line6974"></span>the title of prince of Anhalt-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then. In the same year the princes
<span id="line6975"></span>of Anhalt decided that if any branch of the family became extinct its
<span id="line6976"></span>lands should be equally divided between the remaining branches. This
<span id="line6977"></span>arrangement was carried out after the death of Frederick Augustus
<span id="line6978"></span>of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1793, and Zerbst was divided between the three
<span id="line6979"></span>remaining princes. During these years the policy of the different
<span id="line6980"></span>princes was marked, perhaps intentionally, by considerable uniformity.
<span id="line6981"></span>Once or twice Calvinism was favoured by a prince, but in general the
<span id="line6982"></span>house was loyal to the doctrines of Luther. The growth of Prussia
<span id="line6983"></span>provided Anhalt with a formidable neighbour, and the establishment
<span id="line6984"></span>and practice of primogeniture by all branches of the family
<span id="line6985"></span>prevented further divisions of the principality. In 1806 Alexius of
<span id="line6986"></span>Anhalt-Bernburg was created a duke by the emperor Francis II., and
<span id="line6987"></span>after the dissolution of the Empire each of the three princes
<span id="line6988"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0046</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0046</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0046]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6989"></span>took this title. Joining the Confederation of the Rhine
<span id="line6990"></span>in 1807, they supported Napoleon until 1813, when they transferred
<span id="line6991"></span>their allegiance to the allies; in 1815 they became members of the
<span id="line6992"></span>Germanic Confederation, and in 1828 joined, somewhat reluctantly, the
<span id="line6993"></span>Prussian </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Zollverein</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line6994"></span>
<span id="line6995"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Anhalt-C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then was ruled without division by a succession of princes,
<span id="line6996"></span>prominent among whom was Louis (d. 1650), who was both a soldier and a
<span id="line6997"></span>scholar; and after the death of Prince Charles at the battle of
<span id="line6998"></span>Semlin in 1789 it passed to his son Augustus II. This prince sought to
<span id="line6999"></span>emulate the changes which had recently been made in France by dividing
<span id="line7000"></span>C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then into two departments and introducing the Code Napol<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>eacute;</span>on. Owing
<span id="line7001"></span>to his extravagance he left a large amount of debt to his nephew and
<span id="line7002"></span>successor, Louis II., and on this account the control of the finances
<span id="line7003"></span>was transferred from the prince to the estates. Under Louis's
<span id="line7004"></span>successor Ferdinand, who was a Roman Catholic and brought the Jesuits
<span id="line7005"></span>into Anhalt, the state of the finances grew worse and led to the
<span id="line7006"></span>interference of the king of Prussia and to the appointment of a
<span id="line7007"></span>Prussian official. When the succeeding prince, Henry, died in 1847,
<span id="line7008"></span>this family became extinct, and according to an arrangement between
<span id="line7009"></span>the lines of Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Bernburg, C<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>then was added to
<span id="line7010"></span>Dessau.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7011"></span>
<span id="line7012"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Anhalt-Bernburg had been weakened by partitions, but its princes had
<span id="line7013"></span>added several districts to their lands; and in 1812, on the extinction
<span id="line7014"></span>of a cadet branch, it was again united under a single ruler. The
<span id="line7015"></span>feeble rule of Alexander Charles, who became duke in 1834, and the
<span id="line7016"></span>disturbed state of Europe in the following decade, led to considerable
<span id="line7017"></span>unrest, and in 1849 Bernburg was occupied by Prussian troops. A
<span id="line7018"></span>number of abortive attempts were made to change the government, and
<span id="line7019"></span>as Alexander Charles was unlikely to leave any children, Leopold of
<span id="line7020"></span>Anhalt-Dessau took some part in the affairs of Bernburg. Eventually
<span id="line7021"></span>in 1859 a new constitution was established for Bernburg and Dessau
<span id="line7022"></span>jointly, and when Alexander Charles died in 1863 both were united
<span id="line7023"></span>under the rule of Leopold.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7024"></span>
<span id="line7025"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Anhalt-Dessau had been divided in 1632, but was quickly reunited;
<span id="line7026"></span>and in 1693 it came under the rule of Leopold I. (see ANHALT-DESSAU,
<span id="line7027"></span>LEOPOLD I., PRINCE OF), the famous soldier who was generally known
<span id="line7028"></span>as the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Old Dessauer.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> The sons of Leopold's eldest son were excluded
<span id="line7029"></span>from the succession on account of the marriage of their father being
<span id="line7030"></span>morganatic, and the principality passed in 1747 to his second son,
<span id="line7031"></span>Leopold II. The unrest of 1848 spread to Dessau, and led to the
<span id="line7032"></span>interference of the Prussians and to the establishment of the new
<span id="line7033"></span>constitution in 1859. Leopold IV., who reigned from 1817 to 1871, had
<span id="line7034"></span>the satisfaction in 1863 of reuniting the whole of Anhalt under his
<span id="line7035"></span>rule. He took the title of duke of Anhalt, summoned one </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Landtag</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7036"></span>for the whole of the duchy, and in 1866 fought for Prussia against
<span id="line7037"></span>Austria. Subsequently a quarrel over the possession of the ducal
<span id="line7038"></span>estates between the duke and the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Landtag</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> broke the peace of the
<span id="line7039"></span>duchy, but this was settled in 1872. In 1871 Anhalt became a state of
<span id="line7040"></span>the German Empire. Leopold IV. was followed by his son Frederick I.,
<span id="line7041"></span>and on the death of this prince in 1904 his son Frederick II. became

<span id="line7056"></span>Dessauer<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> (Alter Dessauer), general field marshal in the Prussian
<span id="line7057"></span>army, was the only surviving son of John George II., prince of
<span id="line7058"></span>Anhalt-Dessau, and was born on the 3rd of July 1676 at Dessau. From
<span id="line7059"></span>his earliest youth he was devoted to the profession of arms, for which
<span id="line7060"></span>he educated himself physically and mentally. He became colonel of a
<span id="line7061"></span>Prussian regiment in 1693, and in the same year his father's death
<span id="line7062"></span>placed him at the head of his own principality; thereafter, during the
<span id="line7063"></span>whole of his long life, he performed the duties of a sovereign prince
<span id="line7064"></span>and a Prussian officer. His first campaign was that of 1695 in
<span id="line7065"></span>the Netherlands, in which he was present at the siege of Namur. He
<span id="line7066"></span>remained in the field to the end of the war of 1697, the affairs
<span id="line7067"></span>of the principality being managed chiefly by his mother, Princess
<span id="line7068"></span>Henriette Catherine of Orange. In 1698 he married Anna Luise F<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>se,
<span id="line7069"></span>an apothecary's daughter of Dessau, in spite of his mother's long and
<span id="line7070"></span>earnest opposition, and subsequently he procured for her the rank of
<span id="line7071"></span>a princess from the emperor (1701). Their married life was long and
<span id="line7072"></span>happy, and the princess acquired an influence over the stern nature of
<span id="line7073"></span>her husband which she never ceased to exert on behalf of his subjects,
<span id="line7074"></span>and after the death of Leopold's mother she performed the duties of
<span id="line7075"></span>regent when he was absent on campaign. Often, too, she accompanied him
<span id="line7076"></span>into the field. Leopold's career as a soldier in important commands
<span id="line7077"></span>begins with the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession. He had
<span id="line7078"></span>made many improvements in the Prussian army, notably the introduction
<span id="line7079"></span>of the iron ramrod about 1700, and he now took the field at the
<span id="line7080"></span>head of a Prussian corps on the Rhine, serving at the sieges of
<span id="line7081"></span>Kaiserswerth and Venlo. In the following year (1703), having obtained
<span id="line7082"></span>the rank of lieutenant-general, Leopold took part in the siege of Bonn
<span id="line7083"></span>and distinguished himself very greatly in the battle of H<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>chst<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>auml;</span>dt, in
<span id="line7084"></span>which the Austrians and their allies were defeated by the French under
<span id="line7085"></span>Marshal Villars (September 20, 1703). In the campaign of 1704
<span id="line7086"></span>the Prussian contingent served under Prince Louis of Baden and
<span id="line7087"></span>subsequently under Eugene, and Leopold himself won great glory by his
<span id="line7088"></span>conduct at Blenheim. In 1705 he was sent with a Prussian corps to join
<span id="line7089"></span>Prince Eugene in Italy, and on the 16th of August he displayed his
<span id="line7090"></span>bravery at the hard-fought battle of Cassano. In the following year he
<span id="line7091"></span>added to his reputation in the battle of Turin, where he was the first
<span id="line7092"></span>to enter the hostile entrenchments (September 7, 1706). He served
<span id="line7093"></span>in one more campaign in Italy, and then went with Eugene to join
<span id="line7094"></span>Marlborough in the Netherlands, being present in 1709 at the siege
<span id="line7095"></span>of Tournay and the battle of Malplaquet. In 1710 he succeeded to the
<span id="line7096"></span>command of the whole Prussian contingent at the front, and in 1712, at
<span id="line7097"></span>the particular desire of the crown prince, Frederick William, who had
<span id="line7098"></span>served with him as a volunteer, he was made a general field marshal.
<span id="line7099"></span>Shortly before this he had executed a </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>coup de main</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> on the
<span id="line7100"></span>castle of M<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ouml;</span>rs, which was held by the Dutch in defiance of the claims
<span id="line7101"></span>of the king of Prussia to the possession. The operation was effected
<span id="line7102"></span>with absolute precision and the castle was seized without a shot being
<span id="line7103"></span>fired. In the earlier part of the reign of Frederick William I.,
<span id="line7104"></span>the prince of Dessau was one of the most influential members of
<span id="line7105"></span>the Prussian governing circle. In the war with Sweden (1715) he
<span id="line7106"></span>accompanied the king to the front, commanded an army of 40,000 men,
<span id="line7107"></span>and met and defeated Charles XII. in a severe battle on the island
<span id="line7108"></span>of R<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>uuml;</span>gen (November 16). His conduct of the siege of Stralsund which
<span id="line7109"></span>followed was equally skilful, and the great results of the war
<span id="line7110"></span>to Prussia were largely to be attributed to his leadership in the
<span id="line7111"></span>campaign. In the years of peace, and especially after a court quarrel
<span id="line7112"></span>(1725) and duel with General von Grumbkow, he devoted himself to the
<span id="line7113"></span>training of the Prussian army. The reputation it had gained in the
<span id="line7114"></span>wars of 1675 to 1715, though good, gave no hint of its coming glory,
<span id="line7115"></span>and it was even in 1740 accounted one of the minor armies of Europe.
<span id="line7116"></span>That it proved, when put to the test, to be by far the best military
<span id="line7117"></span>force existing, may be taken as the summary result of Leopold's work.
<span id="line7118"></span>The <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Old Dessauer<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> was one of the sternest disciplinarians in an age
<span id="line7119"></span>of stern discipline, and the technical training of the infantry, under
<span id="line7120"></span>his hand, made them superior to all others in the proportion of five
<span id="line7121"></span>to three (see AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION, WAR OF THE). He was essentially an
<span id="line7122"></span>infantry soldier; in his time artillery did not decide battles, but he
<span id="line7123"></span>suffered the cavalry service, in which he felt little interest, to
<span id="line7124"></span>be comparatively neglected, with results which appeared at Mollwitz.
<span id="line7125"></span>Frederick the Great formed the cavalry of Hohenfriedberg and Leuthen
<span id="line7126"></span>himself, but had it not been for the incomparable infantry trained by
<span id="line7127"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Old Dessauer<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> he would never have had the opportunity of doing
<span id="line7128"></span>so. Thus Leopold, heartily supported by Frederick William, who was
<span id="line7129"></span>himself called the great drill-master of Europe, turned to good
<span id="line7130"></span>account the twenty years following the peace with Sweden. During this
<span id="line7131"></span>time two incidents in his career call for special mention: first,
<span id="line7132"></span>his intervention in the case of the crown prince Frederick, who
<span id="line7133"></span>was condemned to death for desertion, and his continued and finally
<span id="line7134"></span>successful efforts to
<span id="line7135"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0047</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0047</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0047]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7136"></span>secure Frederick's reinstatement in the Prussian army;
<span id="line7137"></span>and secondly, his part in the War of the Polish Succession on the
<span id="line7138"></span>Rhine, where he served under his old chief Eugene and held the office
<span id="line7139"></span>of field marshal of the Empire.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7140"></span>
<span id="line7141"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>With the death of Frederick William in 1740, Frederick succeeded to
<span id="line7142"></span>the Prussian throne, and a few months later took place the invasion
<span id="line7143"></span>and conquest of Silesia, the first act in the long Silesian wars and
<span id="line7144"></span>the test of the work of the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Old Dessauer's<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> lifetime. The prince
<span id="line7145"></span>himself was not often employed in the king's own army, though his sons
<span id="line7146"></span>held high commands under Frederick. The king, indeed, found Leopold,
<span id="line7147"></span>who was reputed, since the death of Eugene, the greatest of living
<span id="line7148"></span>soldiers, somewhat difficult to manage, and the prince spent most of
<span id="line7149"></span>the campaigning years up to 1745 in command of an army of observation
<span id="line7150"></span>on the Saxon frontier. Early in that year his wife died. He was
<span id="line7151"></span>now over seventy, but his last campaign was destined to be the most
<span id="line7152"></span>brilliant of his long career. A combined effort of the Austrians and
<span id="line7153"></span>Saxons to retrieve the disasters of the summer by a winter campaign
<span id="line7154"></span>towards Berlin itself led to a hurried concentration of the Prussians.
<span id="line7155"></span>Frederick from Silesia checked the Austrian main army and hastened
<span id="line7156"></span>towards Dresden. But before he had arrived, Leopold, no longer in
<span id="line7157"></span>observation, had decided the war by his overwhelming victory of
<span id="line7158"></span>Kesselsdorf (December 14, 1745). It was his habit to pray before
<span id="line7159"></span>battle, for he was a devout Lutheran. On this last field his words
<span id="line7160"></span>were, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>O Lord God, let me not be disgraced in my old days. Or if Thou
<span id="line7161"></span>wilt not help me, do not help these scoundrels, but leave us to try it
<span id="line7162"></span>ourselves.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> With this great victory Leopold's career ended. He retired
<span id="line7163"></span>from active service, and the short remainder of his life was spent at
<span id="line7164"></span>Dessau, where he died on the 7th of April 1747.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7165"></span>
<span id="line7166"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>He was succeeded by his son, LEOPOLD II., MAXIMILIAN, PRINCE OF
<span id="line7167"></span>ANHALT-DESSAU (1700-1751), who was one of the best of Frederick's
<span id="line7168"></span>subordinate generals, and especially distinguished himself by the
<span id="line7169"></span>capture of Glogau in 1741, and his generalship at Mollwitz, Chotusitz
<span id="line7170"></span>(where he was made general field marshal on the field of battle),
<span id="line7171"></span>Hohenfriedberg and Soor.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7172"></span>
<span id="line7173"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Another son, PRINCE DIETRICH OF ANHALT-DESSAU (d. 1769), was also a
<span id="line7174"></span>distinguished Prussian general.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7175"></span>
<span id="line7176"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>But the most famous of the sons was PRINCE MORITZ OF ANHALT-DESSAU
<span id="line7177"></span>(1712-1760), who entered the Prussian army in 1725, saw his first
<span id="line7178"></span>service as a volunteer in the War of the Polish Succession (1734-35),
<span id="line7179"></span>and in the latter years of the reign of Frederick William held
<span id="line7180"></span>important commands. In the Silesian wars of Frederick II., Moritz,
<span id="line7181"></span>the ablest of the old Leopold's sons, greatly distinguished himself,
<span id="line7182"></span>especially at the battle of Hohenfriedberg (Striegau), 1745. At
<span id="line7183"></span>Kesselsdorf it was the wing led by the young Prince Moritz that
<span id="line7184"></span>carried the Austrian lines and won the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>Old Dessauer's<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> last fight. In
<span id="line7185"></span>the years of peace preceding the Seven Years' War, Moritz was employed
<span id="line7186"></span>by Frederick the Great in the colonizing of the waste lands of
<span id="line7187"></span>Pomerania and the Oder Valley. When the king took the field again in
<span id="line7188"></span>1756, Moritz was in command of one of the columns which hemmed in the
<span id="line7189"></span>Saxon army in the lines of Pirna, and he received the surrender of
<span id="line7190"></span>Rutowski's force after the failure of the Austrian attempts at relief.
<span id="line7191"></span>Next year Moritz underwent changes of fortune. At the battle of Kolin
<span id="line7192"></span>he led the left wing, which, through a misunderstanding with the
<span id="line7193"></span>king, was prematurely drawn into action and failed hopelessly. In
<span id="line7194"></span>the disastrous days which followed, Moritz was under the cloud of
<span id="line7195"></span>Frederick's displeasure. But the glorious victory of Leuthen (December
<span id="line7196"></span>5, 1757) put an end to this. At the close of that day, Frederick
<span id="line7197"></span>rode down the lines and called out to General Prince Moritz,
<span id="line7198"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>I congratulate you, Herr Feldmarschall!<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> At Zorndorf he again
<span id="line7199"></span>distinguished himself, but at the surprise of Hochkirch fell wounded
<span id="line7200"></span>into the hands of the Austrians. Two years later, soon after his
<span id="line7201"></span>release, his wound proved mortal.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7223"></span>orthorhombic system, and has three directions of perfect cleavage
<span id="line7224"></span>parallel to the three planes of symmetry. It is not isomorphous with
<span id="line7225"></span>the orthorhombic barium and strontium sulphates, as might be expected
<span id="line7226"></span>from the chemical formulae. Distinctly developed crystals are somewhat
<span id="line7227"></span>rare, the mineral usually presenting the form of cleavage masses. The
<span id="line7228"></span>hardness is 3<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>frac12;</span> and the specific gravity 2.9. The colour is white,
<span id="line7229"></span>sometimes greyish, bluish or reddish. On the best developed of the
<span id="line7230"></span>three cleavages the lustre is pearly, on other surfaces it is of the
<span id="line7231"></span>ordinary vitreous type.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7234"></span>was, for instance, first discovered, in 1794, in a salt mine near
<span id="line7235"></span>Hall in Tirol. Other localities which produce typical specimens of the
<span id="line7236"></span>mineral, and where the mode of occurrence is the same, are Stassfurt
<span id="line7237"></span>in Germany, Aussee in Styria and Bex in Switzerland. At all these
<span id="line7238"></span>places it is only met with at some depth; nearer the surface of the
<span id="line7239"></span>ground it has been altered to gypsum owing to absorption of water.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7244"></span>methods by which the mineral has been prepared artificially, and
<span id="line7245"></span>is identical with its mode of origin in nature, the mineral having

<span id="line7344"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The great commercial value of aniline is due to the readiness with
<span id="line7345"></span>which it yields, directly or indirectly, valuable dyestuffs. The

<span id="line7370"></span>first used as a noun or adjective to denote a living thing, but now
<span id="line7371"></span>used to designate one branch of living things as opposed to the other
<span id="line7372"></span>branch known as plants. Until the discovery of protoplasm, and the
<span id="line7373"></span>series of investigations by which it was established that the cell was
<span id="line7374"></span>a fundamental structure essentially alike in both animals and plants
<span id="line7375"></span>(see CYTOLOGY), there was a vague belief that plants, if they could
<span id="line7376"></span>really be regarded as animated creatures, exhibited at the most a
<span id="line7377"></span>lower grade of life. We know now that in so far as life and living
<span id="line7378"></span>matter can be investigated by science, animals and plants cannot be
<span id="line7379"></span>described as being alive in different degrees. Animals and plants
<span id="line7380"></span>are extremely closely related organisms, alike in their fundamental
<span id="line7381"></span>characters, and each grading into organisms which possess some of
<span id="line7382"></span>the characters of both classes or kingdoms (see PROTISTA). The actual
<span id="line7383"></span>boundaries between animals and plants are artificial; they are
<span id="line7384"></span>rather due to the ingenious analysis of the systematist than actually
<span id="line7385"></span>resident in objective nature. The most obvious distinction is that
<span id="line7386"></span>the animal cell-wall is either absent or composed of a nitrogenous
<span id="line7387"></span>material, whereas the plant cell-wall is composed of a carbohydrate
<span id="line7388"></span>material<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>cellulose. The animal and the plant alike require food to
<span id="line7389"></span>repair waste, to build up new tissue and to provide material which,
<span id="line7390"></span>by chemical change, may liberate the energy which appears in the
<span id="line7391"></span>processes of life. The food is alike in both cases; it consists of
<span id="line7392"></span>water, certain inorganic salts, carbohydrate material and proteid
<span id="line7393"></span>material. Both animals and plants take their water and inorganic salts
<span id="line7394"></span>directly as such. The animal cell can absorb its carbohydrate and
<span id="line7395"></span>proteid food only in the form of carbohydrate and proteid; it is
<span id="line7396"></span>dependent, in fact, on the pre-existence of these organic substances,
<span id="line7397"></span>themselves the products of living matter, and in this respect the
<span id="line7398"></span>animal is essentially a parasite on existing animal and plant life.
<span id="line7399"></span>The plant, on the other hand, if it be a green plant, containing
<span id="line7400"></span>chlorophyll, is capable, in the presence of light, of building up both
<span id="line7401"></span>carbohydrate material and proteid material from inorganic salts; if
<span id="line7402"></span>it be a fungus, devoid of chlorophyll, whilst it is dependent on
<span id="line7403"></span>pre-existing carbohydrate material and is capable of absorbing,
<span id="line7404"></span>like an animal, proteid material as such, it is able to build up its
<span id="line7405"></span>proteid food from material chemically simpler than proteid. On these
<span id="line7406"></span>basal differences are founded most of the characters which make the
<span id="line7407"></span>higher forms of animal and plant life so different. The animal body,
<span id="line7408"></span>if it be composed of many cells, follows a different architectural
<span id="line7409"></span>plan; the compact nature of its food, and the yielding nature of its
<span id="line7410"></span>cell-walls, result in a form of structure consisting essentially of
<span id="line7411"></span>tubular or spherical masses of cells arranged concentrically round the
<span id="line7412"></span>food-cavity. The relatively rigid nature of the plant cell-wall, and
<span id="line7413"></span>the attenuated inorganic food-supply of plants, make possible and
<span id="line7414"></span>necessary a form of growth in which the greatest surface is exposed to
<span id="line7415"></span>the exterior, and thus the plant body is composed of flattened laminae
<span id="line7416"></span>and elongated branching growths. The distinctions between animals and
<span id="line7417"></span>plants are in fact obviously secondary and adaptive, and point clearly
<span id="line7418"></span>towards the conception of a common origin for the two forms of life, a
<span id="line7419"></span>conception which is made still more probable by the existence of many
<span id="line7420"></span>low forms in which the primary differences between animals and plants

<span id="line7444"></span>both in summer and winter their mean temperature remains the same. But
<span id="line7445"></span>it was not until the introduction of thermometers that any exact data
<span id="line7446"></span>on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found
<span id="line7447"></span>that local differences were present, since heat production and heat
<span id="line7448"></span>loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the
<span id="line7449"></span>circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of
<span id="line7450"></span>the internal parts. Hence it is important to determine the temperature
<span id="line7451"></span>of those parts which most nearly approaches to that of the internal
<span id="line7452"></span>organs. Also for such results to be comparable they must be made in

<span id="line7464"></span>men and animals, John Hunter showed that the essential difference
<span id="line7465"></span>between the so-called warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals lies in
<span id="line7466"></span>the constancy of the temperature of the former, and the variability
<span id="line7467"></span>of the temperature of the latter. Those animals high in the scale
<span id="line7468"></span>of evolution, as birds and mammals, have a high temperature almost
<span id="line7469"></span>constant and independent of that of the surrounding air, whereas
<span id="line7470"></span>among the lower animals there is much variation of body temperature,
<span id="line7471"></span>dependent entirely on their surroundings. There are, however, certain
<span id="line7472"></span>mammals which are exceptions, being warm-blooded during the summer,
<span id="line7473"></span>but cold-blooded during the winter when they hibernate; such are the
<span id="line7474"></span>hedgehog, bat and dormouse. John Hunter suggested that two groups
<span id="line7475"></span>should be known as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>animals of permanent heat at all atmospheres<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and
<span id="line7476"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>animals of a heat variable with every atmosphere,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> but later
<span id="line7477"></span>Bergmann suggested that they should be known as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>homoiothermic<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> and
<span id="line7478"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>poikilothermic<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> animals. But it must be remembered there is no hard
<span id="line7479"></span>and fast line between the two groups. Also, from work recently done
<span id="line7480"></span>by J. O. Wakelin Barratt, it has been shown that under certain
<span id="line7481"></span>pathological conditions a warm-blooded (homoiothermic) animal
<span id="line7482"></span>may become for a time cold-blooded (poikilothermic). He has shown
<span id="line7483"></span>conclusively that this condition exists in rabbits suffering from
<span id="line7484"></span>rabies during the last period of their life, the rectal temperature
<span id="line7485"></span>being then within a few degrees of the room temperature and varying
<span id="line7486"></span>with it. He explains this condition by the assumption that the nervous
<span id="line7487"></span>mechanism of heat regulation has become paralysed. The respiration and
<span id="line7488"></span>heart-rate being also retarded during this period, the resemblance
<span id="line7489"></span>to the condition of hibernation is considerable. Again, Sutherland
<span id="line7490"></span>Simpson has shown that during deep anaesthesia a warm-blooded animal
<span id="line7491"></span>tends to take the same temperature as that of its environment. He
<span id="line7492"></span>demonstrated that when a monkey is kept deeply anaesthetized with
<span id="line7493"></span>ether and is placed in a cold chamber, its temperature gradually
<span id="line7494"></span>falls, and that when it has reached a sufficiently low point (about
<span id="line7495"></span>25<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C. in the monkey), the employment of an anaesthetic is no longer
<span id="line7496"></span>necessary, the animal then being insensible to pain and incapable of
<span id="line7497"></span>being roused by any form of stimulus; it is, in fact, narcotized
<span id="line7498"></span>by cold, and is in a state of what may be called <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>artificial
<span id="line7499"></span>hibernation.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> Once again this is explained by the fact that the
<span id="line7500"></span>heat-regulating mechanism has been interfered with. Similar results
<span id="line7501"></span>have been obtained from experiments on cats. These facts<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>with
<span id="line7502"></span>many others<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>tend to show that the power of maintaining a constant
<span id="line7503"></span>temperature has been a gradual development, as Darwin's theory of
<span id="line7504"></span>evolution suggests, and that anything that interferes with the due
<span id="line7505"></span>working of the higher nerve-centres puts the animal back again, for
<span id="line7506"></span>the time being, on to a lower plane of evolution.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7518"></span>is maintained with but slight variation. In health under normal
<span id="line7519"></span>conditions the temperature of man varies between 36<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C. and 38<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C.,

<span id="line7522"></span>higher than this; and in the rectum some .9<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C. higher still. The
<span id="line7523"></span>temperature of infants and young children has a much greater range
<span id="line7524"></span>than this, and is susceptible of wide divergencies from comparatively
<span id="line7525"></span>slight causes.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7526"></span>
<span id="line7527"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Of the lower warm-blooded animals, there are some that appear to be
<span id="line7528"></span>cold-blooded at birth. Kittens, rabbits and puppies, if removed from
<span id="line7529"></span>their surroundings shortly after birth, lose their body heat until
<span id="line7530"></span>their temperature has fallen to within a few degrees of that of the
<span id="line7531"></span>surrounding air. But such animals are at birth blind, helpless and in
<span id="line7532"></span>some cases naked. Animals who are born when in a condition of greater
<span id="line7533"></span>development can maintain their temperature fairly constant. In strong,
<span id="line7534"></span>healthy infants a day or two old the temperature rises slightly, but
<span id="line7535"></span>in that of weakly, ill-developed children it either remains stationary
<span id="line7536"></span>or falls. The cause of the variable temperature in infants and
<span id="line7537"></span>young immature animals is the imperfect development of the nervous
<span id="line7538"></span>regulating mechanism.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7539"></span>
<span id="line7540"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The average temperature falls slightly from infancy to puberty and
<span id="line7541"></span>again from puberty to middle age, but after that stage is passed the
<span id="line7542"></span>temperature begins to rise again, and by about the eightieth year is
<span id="line7543"></span>as high as in infancy. A diurnal variation has been observed dependent
<span id="line7544"></span>on the periods of rest and activity, the maximum ranging from 10 A.M.
<span id="line7545"></span>to 6 P.M., the minimum from 11 P.M. to 3 A.M. Sutherland Simpson and
<span id="line7546"></span>J. J. Galbraith have recently done much work on this subject. In their
<span id="line7547"></span>first experiments they showed that in a monkey there is a well-marked
<span id="line7548"></span>and regular diurnal variation of the body temperature, and that by
<span id="line7549"></span>reversing the daily routine this diurnal variation is also reversed.
<span id="line7550"></span>The diurnal temperature curve follows the periods of rest and
<span id="line7551"></span>activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; in
<span id="line7552"></span>monkeys which are active during the night and resting during the day,
<span id="line7553"></span>the body temperature is highest at night and lowest through the day.
<span id="line7554"></span>They then made observations on the temperature of animals and birds of
<span id="line7555"></span>nocturnal habit, where the periods of rest and activity are naturally
<span id="line7556"></span>the reverse of the ordinary through habit and not from outside
<span id="line7557"></span>interference. They found that in nocturnal birds the temperature
<span id="line7558"></span>is highest during the natural period of activity (night) and lowest
<span id="line7559"></span>during the period of rest (day), but that the mean temperature is
<span id="line7560"></span>lower and the range less than in diurnal birds of the same size. That
<span id="line7561"></span>the temperature curve of diurnal birds is essentially similar to that
<span id="line7562"></span>of man and other homoiothermal animals, except that the maximum occurs
<span id="line7563"></span>earlier in the afternoon and the minimum earlier in the morning. Also
<span id="line7564"></span>that the curves obtained from rabbit, guinea-pig and dog were quite
<span id="line7565"></span>similar to those from man. The mean temperature of the female was
<span id="line7566"></span>higher than that of the male in all the species examined whose sex had
<span id="line7567"></span>been determined.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7572"></span>and variations of external temperature within ordinary
<span id="line7573"></span>limits cause very slight change, as there are many compensating
<span id="line7574"></span>influences at work, which are discussed later. Even from very active
<span id="line7575"></span>exercise the temperature does not rise more than one degree, and if
<span id="line7576"></span>carried to exhaustion a fall is observed. In travelling from very cold
<span id="line7577"></span>to very hot regions a variation of less than one degree occurs,
<span id="line7578"></span>and the temperature of those living in the tropics is practically
<span id="line7579"></span>identical with those dwelling in the Arctic regions.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7582"></span>cold that a warm-blooded animal can bear, and other far wider limits
<span id="line7583"></span>that a cold-blooded animal may endure and yet live. The effect of
<span id="line7584"></span>too extreme a cold is to lessen metabolism, and hence to lessen the
<span id="line7585"></span>production of heat. Both katabolic and anabolic changes share in the
<span id="line7586"></span>depression, and though less energy is used up, still less energy
<span id="line7587"></span>is generated. This diminished metabolism tells first on the central
<span id="line7588"></span>nervous system, especially the brain and those parts concerned
<span id="line7589"></span>in consciousness. Both heart-beat and respiration-number become
<span id="line7590"></span>diminished, drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until it
<span id="line7591"></span>passes into the sleep of death. Occasionally, however, convulsions
<span id="line7592"></span>may set in towards the end, and a death somewhat similar to that of
<span id="line7593"></span>asphyxia takes place. In some recent experiments on cats performed
<span id="line7594"></span>by Sutherland Simpson and Percy T. Herring, they found them unable to
<span id="line7595"></span>survive when the rectal temperature was reduced below 16<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C. At
<span id="line7596"></span>this low temperature respiration became increasingly feeble, the
<span id="line7597"></span>heart-impulse usually continued after respiration had ceased, the
<span id="line7598"></span>beats becoming very irregular, apparently ceasing, then beginning
<span id="line7599"></span>again. Death appeared to be mainly due to asphyxia, and the only
<span id="line7600"></span>certain sign that it had taken place was the loss of knee jerks. On
<span id="line7601"></span>the other hand, too high a temperature hurries on the metabolism
<span id="line7602"></span>of the various tissues at such a rate that their capital is soon
<span id="line7603"></span>exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces dyspnoea and soon exhausts
<span id="line7604"></span>the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre. The rate of the heart
<span id="line7605"></span>is quickened, the beats then become irregular and finally cease. The
<span id="line7606"></span>central nervous system is also profoundly affected, consciousness may
<span id="line7607"></span>be lost, and the patient falls into a comatose condition, or delirium
<span id="line7608"></span>and convulsions may set in. All these changes can be watched in any
<span id="line7609"></span>patient suffering from an acute fever. The lower limit of temperature
<span id="line7610"></span>that man can endure depends on many things, but no one can survive
<span id="line7611"></span>a temperature of 45<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C. (113<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> F.) or above for very long. Mammalian
<span id="line7612"></span>muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C., and obviously
<span id="line7613"></span>should this temperature be reached the sudden rigidity of the whole
<span id="line7614"></span>body would render life impossible. H. M. Vernon has recently done work
<span id="line7615"></span>on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of
<span id="line7616"></span>heat rigor) of various animals. He found that animals of the same
<span id="line7617"></span>class of the animal kingdom showed very similar temperature values,
<span id="line7618"></span>those from the Amphibia examined being 38.5<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span> C., Fishes 39<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span>, Reptilia
<span id="line7619"></span>45<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span>, and various Molluscs 46<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>deg;</span>. Also in the case of Pelagic animals he
<span id="line7620"></span>showed a relation between death temperature and the quantity of
<span id="line7621"></span>solid constituents of the body, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cestus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> having lowest death
<span id="line7622"></span>temperature and least amount of solids in its body. But in the higher
<span id="line7623"></span>animals his experiments tend to show that there is greater variation
<span id="line7624"></span>in both the chemical and physical characters of the protoplasm, and
<span id="line7625"></span>hence greater variation in the extreme temperature compatible with
<span id="line7626"></span>life.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7629"></span>by the chemical changes<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>those of oxidation<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>undergone not by any
<span id="line7630"></span>particular substance or in any one place, but by the tissues at large.
<span id="line7631"></span>Wherever destructive metabolism (katabolism) is going on, heat is
<span id="line7632"></span>being set free. When a muscle does work it also gives rise to heat,
<span id="line7633"></span>and if this is estimated it can be shown that the muscles alone during
<span id="line7634"></span>their contractions provide far more heat than the whole amount given
<span id="line7635"></span>out by the body. Also it must be remembered that the heart<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>also a
<span id="line7636"></span>muscle,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>never resting, does in the 24 hours no inconsiderable amount
<span id="line7637"></span>of work, and hence must give rise to no inconsiderable amount of heat.
<span id="line7638"></span>From this it is clear that the larger proportion of total heat of
<span id="line7639"></span>the body is supplied by the muscles. These are essentially the
<span id="line7640"></span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>thermogenic tissues.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> Next to the muscles as heat generators come the
<span id="line7641"></span>various secretory glands, especially the liver, which appears never to
<span id="line7642"></span>rest in this respect. The brain also must be a source of heat, since
<span id="line7643"></span>its temperature is higher than that of the arterial blood with which
<span id="line7644"></span>it is supplied. Also a certain amount of heat is produced by the
<span id="line7645"></span>changes which the food undergoes in the alimentary canal before it
<span id="line7646"></span>really enters the body. But heat while continually being produced is
<span id="line7647"></span>also continually being lost by the skin, lungs, urine and faeces.
<span id="line7648"></span>And it is by the constant modification of these two factors, (1)
<span id="line7649"></span>heat production and (2) heat loss, that the constant temperature of
<span id="line7650"></span>a warm-blooded animal is maintained. Heat is lost to the body through
<span id="line7651"></span>the faeces and urine, respiration, conduction and radiation from
<span id="line7652"></span>the skin, and by evaporation of perspiration. The following are
<span id="line7653"></span>approximately the relative amounts of heat lost through these
<span id="line7654"></span>various channels (different authorities give somewhat different
<span id="line7655"></span>figures):<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>faeces and urine about 3, respiration about 20, skin
<span id="line7656"></span>(conduction, radiation and evaporation) about 77. Hence it is clear
<span id="line7657"></span>the chief means of loss are the skin and the lungs. The more air that
<span id="line7658"></span>passes in and out of the lungs in a given time, the greater the loss
<span id="line7659"></span>of heat. And in such animals as the dog, who do not perspire easily by
<span id="line7660"></span>the skin, respiration becomes far more important.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7661"></span>
<span id="line7662"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>But for man the great heat regulator is undoubtedly the skin, which
<span id="line7663"></span>regulates heat loss by its vasomotor mechanism, and also by the
<span id="line7664"></span>nervous mechanism of perspiration. Dilatation of the cutaneous
<span id="line7665"></span>vascular areas leads to a larger flow of blood through the skin, and
<span id="line7666"></span>so tends to cool the body, and </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>vice versa</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>. Also the special
<span id="line7667"></span>nerves of perspiration can increase or lessen heat loss by promoting
<span id="line7668"></span>or diminishing the secretions of the skin. There are greater
<span id="line7669"></span>difficulties in the exact determination in the amount of heat
<span id="line7670"></span>produced, but there are certain well-known facts in connexion with it.
<span id="line7671"></span>A larger living body naturally produces more heat than a smaller one
<span id="line7672"></span>of the same nature, but the surface of the smaller, being greater in
<span id="line7673"></span>proportion to its bulk than that of the larger, loses heat at a more
<span id="line7674"></span>rapid rate. Hence to maintain the same constant bodily temperature,
<span id="line7675"></span>the smaller animal must produce a relatively larger amount of heat.
<span id="line7676"></span>And in the struggle for existence this has become so.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7678"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Food temporarily increases the production of heat, the rate of

<span id="line7723"></span>(A) according to their outward form; (B) according to their inward
<span id="line7724"></span>meaning, which may of course undergo transformations.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7725"></span>
<span id="line7726"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(A) There are two broad divisions: (1) all animals of a given species
<span id="line7727"></span>are sacred, perhaps owing to the impossibility of distinguishing the
<span id="line7728"></span>sacred few from the profane crowd; (2) one or a fixed number of a
<span id="line7729"></span>species are sacred. It is probable that the first of these forms is
<span id="line7730"></span>the primary one and the second in most cases a development from it due
<span id="line7731"></span>to (i.) the influence of other individual cults, (ii.) anthropomorphic
<span id="line7732"></span>tendencies, (iii.) the influence of chieftainship, hereditary and
<span id="line7733"></span>otherwise, (iv.) annual sacrifice of the sacred animal and mystical
<span id="line7734"></span>ideas connected therewith, (v.) syncretism, due either to unity of
<span id="line7735"></span>function or to a philosophic unification, (vi.) the desire to do
<span id="line7736"></span>honour to the species in the person of one of its members, and
<span id="line7737"></span>possibly other less easily traceable causes.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7738"></span>
<span id="line7739"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(B) Treating cults according to their meaning, which is not
<span id="line7740"></span>necessarily identical with the cause which first led to the
<span id="line7741"></span>deification of the animal in question, we can classify them under ten
<span id="line7742"></span>specific heads: (i.) pastoral cults; (ii.) hunting cults; (iii.) cults
<span id="line7743"></span>of dangerous or noxious animals; (iv.) cults of animals regarded as
<span id="line7744"></span>human souls or their embodiment; (v.) totemistic cults; (vi.) cults
<span id="line7745"></span>of secret societies, and individual cults of tutelary animals;
<span id="line7746"></span>(vii.) cults of tree and vegetation spirits; (viii.) cults of ominous
<span id="line7747"></span>animals; (ix.) cults, probably derivative, of animals associated with
<span id="line7748"></span>certain deities; (x.) cults of animals used in magic.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7749"></span>
<span id="line7750"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(i.) The pastoral type falls into two sub-types, in which the species
<span id="line7751"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>a</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) is spared and (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>b</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) sometimes receives special
<span id="line7752"></span>honour at intervals in the person of an individual. (See </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Cattle,
<span id="line7753"></span>Buffalo</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7754"></span>
<span id="line7755"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(ii.) In hunting cults the species is habitually killed, but
<span id="line7756"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>a</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) occasionally honoured in the person of a single individual,
<span id="line7757"></span>or (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>b</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) each slaughtered animal receives divine honours. (See
<span id="line7758"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Bear</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7759"></span>
<span id="line7760"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(iii.) The cult of dangerous animals is due (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>a</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) to the fear
<span id="line7761"></span>that the soul of the slain beast may take vengeance on the hunter,
<span id="line7762"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>b</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) to a desire to placate the rest of the species. (See
<span id="line7763"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Leopard</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7764"></span>
<span id="line7765"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(iv.) Animals are frequently regarded as the abode, temporary or
<span id="line7766"></span>permanent, of the souls of the dead, sometimes as the actual souls of
<span id="line7767"></span>the dead. Respect for them is due to two main reasons: (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>a</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>)
<span id="line7768"></span>the kinsmen of the dead desire to preserve the goodwill of their dead
<span id="line7769"></span>relatives; (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>b</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) they wish at the same time to secure that their
<span id="line7770"></span>kinsmen are not molested and caused to undergo unnecessary suffering.
<span id="line7771"></span>(See </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Serpent</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7772"></span>
<span id="line7773"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(v.) One of the most widely found modes of showing respect to animals
<span id="line7774"></span>is known as totemism (see TOTEM AND TOTEMISM), but except in decadent
<span id="line7775"></span>forms there is but little positive worship; in Central Australia,
<span id="line7776"></span>however, the rites of the Wollunqua totem group are directed towards
<span id="line7777"></span>placating this mythical animal, and cannot be termed anything but
<span id="line7778"></span>religious ceremonies.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7779"></span>
<span id="line7780"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(vi.) In secret societies we find bodies of men grouped together with
<span id="line7781"></span>a single tutelary animal; the individual, in the same way, acquires
<span id="line7782"></span>the nagual or individual totem, sometimes by ceremonies of the nature
<span id="line7783"></span>of the bloodbond.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7784"></span>
<span id="line7785"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(vii.) Spirits of vegetation in ancient and modern Europe and in China
<span id="line7786"></span>are conceived in animal form. (See </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Goat</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7787"></span>
<span id="line7788"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(viii.) The ominous animal or bird may develop into a deity. (See
<span id="line7789"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Hawk</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, below.)</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7790"></span>
<span id="line7791"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(ix.) It is commonly assumed that the animals associated with certain
<span id="line7792"></span>deities are sacred because the god was originally theriomorphic; this
<span id="line7793"></span>is doubtless the case in certain instances; but Apollo Smintheus,
<span id="line7794"></span>Dionysus Bassareus and other examples seem to show that the god may
<span id="line7795"></span>have been appealed to for help and thus become associated with the
<span id="line7796"></span>animals from whom he protected the crops, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7797"></span>
<span id="line7798"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>(x.) The use of animals in magic may sometimes give rise to a kind
<span id="line7799"></span>of respect for them, but this is of a negative nature. See, however,
<span id="line7800"></span>articles by Preuss in </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Globus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, vol. lxvii., in which he
<span id="line7801"></span>maintains that animals of magical influence are elevated into
<span id="line7802"></span>divinities.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7807"></span>savage races that come in contact with it, which shows itself
<span id="line7808"></span>in apologies and in festivals in its honour. The most important
<span id="line7809"></span>developments of the cult are in East Asia among the Siberian tribes;
<span id="line7810"></span>among the Ainu of Sakhalin a young bear is caught at the end of winter
<span id="line7811"></span>and fed for some nine months; then after receiving honours it is
<span id="line7812"></span>killed, and the people, who previously show marks of grief at its
<span id="line7813"></span>approaching fate, dance merrily and feast on its body. Among the
<span id="line7814"></span>Gilyaks a similar festival is found, but here it takes the form of a
<span id="line7815"></span>celebration in honour of a recently dead kinsman, to whom the spirit
<span id="line7816"></span>of the bear is sent. Whether this feature or a cult of the hunting
<span id="line7817"></span>type was the primary form, is so far an open question. There is a good
<span id="line7818"></span>deal of evidence to connect the Greek goddess Artemis with a cult of
<span id="line7819"></span>the bear; girls danced as <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>bears<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> in her honour, and might not marry
<span id="line7820"></span>before undergoing this ceremony. The bear is traditionally associated
<span id="line7821"></span>with Bern in Switzerland, and in 1832 a statue of Artio, a bear
<span id="line7822"></span>goddess, was dug up there.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

India abstain from the flesh of their
<span id="line7825"></span>domestic animal, the buffalo; but once a year they sacrifice a bull

<span id="line7829"></span>live on milk or game, and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial
<span id="line7830"></span>function. Conspicuous among Egyptian animal cults was that of the
<span id="line7831"></span>bull, Apis. It was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old
<span id="line7832"></span>Apis died a new one was sought; the finder was rewarded, and the
<span id="line7833"></span>bull underwent four months' education at Nilopolis. Its birthday
<span id="line7834"></span>was celebrated once a year; oxen, which had to be pure white, were
<span id="line7835"></span>sacrificed to it; women were forbidden to approach it when once its
<span id="line7836"></span>education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various
<span id="line7837"></span>ways. After death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. Less
<span id="line7838"></span>widespread was the cult of the Mnevis, also consecrated to Osiris.
<span id="line7839"></span>Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper Nile; the
<span id="line7840"></span>Nuba and Nuer worship the bull; the Angoni of Central Africa and the
<span id="line7841"></span>Sakalava of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In India respect for the
<span id="line7842"></span>cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual
<span id="line7843"></span>worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line7854"></span>authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the

<span id="line7856"></span>In Nepal it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called

<span id="line7861"></span>contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha; when one is taken
<span id="line7862"></span>the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept
<span id="line7863"></span>ever afterwards; it cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and f<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>ted
<span id="line7864"></span>and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of
<span id="line7865"></span>Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure
<span id="line7866"></span>people after death; it is therefore f<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>ecirc;</span>ted by a whole village. In
<span id="line7867"></span>Cambodia it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. In Sumatra the
<span id="line7868"></span>elephant is regarded as a tutelary spirit. The cult of the white

<span id="line7895"></span>regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The

<span id="line7909"></span>were called Poloi (colts) in Laconia. In Gaul we find a horse-goddess,

<span id="line7911"></span>India worship a horse-god, Koda Pen, in the form of a shapeless stone;
<span id="line7912"></span>but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or

<span id="line7918"></span>is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his
<span id="line7919"></span>victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he
<span id="line7920"></span>may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and

<span id="line7944"></span>the Old World; it is also not unknown in America; in Australia, on the
<span id="line7945"></span>other hand, though many species of serpent are found, there does not
<span id="line7946"></span>appear to be any species of cult unless we include the Warramunga cult
<span id="line7947"></span>of the mythical Wollunqua totem animal, whom they seek to placate by
<span id="line7948"></span>rites. In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey; but
<span id="line7949"></span>the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating
<span id="line7950"></span>back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of
<span id="line7951"></span>Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent
<span id="line7952"></span>worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the cult which they
<span id="line7953"></span>at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent
<span id="line7954"></span>temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes; every python of the danh-gbi
<span id="line7955"></span>kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for
<span id="line7956"></span>killing one, even by accident. Danh-gbi has numerous wives, who until
<span id="line7957"></span>1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was
<span id="line7958"></span>excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as
<span id="line7959"></span>a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ewe was
<span id="line7960"></span>also conceived to have the form of a snake; his messenger was said to
<span id="line7961"></span>be a small variety of boa; but only certain individuals, not the whole
<span id="line7962"></span>species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked
<span id="line7963"></span>upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives; among the Amazulu, as
<span id="line7964"></span>among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the
<span id="line7965"></span>abode of certain classes; the Masai, on the other hand, regard each
<span id="line7966"></span>species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line7967"></span>
<span id="line7968"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>In America some of the Amerindian tribes reverence the rattlesnake as
<span id="line7969"></span>grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause
<span id="line7970"></span>tempest. Among the Hopi (Moqui) of Arizona the serpent figures largely
<span id="line7971"></span>in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshipped in the Natchez
<span id="line7972"></span>temple of the sun; and the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl was a serpent-god.
<span id="line7973"></span>The tribes of Peru are said to have adored great snakes in the
<span id="line7974"></span>pre-Inca days; and in Chile the Araucanians made a serpent figure in

<span id="line7980"></span>Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human

<span id="line7987"></span>hand, we learn from Herodotus of the great serpent which defended the

<span id="line7989"></span>a serpent; a snake was kept and fed with milk in the temple of
<span id="line7990"></span>Potrimpos, an old Slavonic god. To this day there are numerous traces
<span id="line7991"></span>in popular belief, especially in Germany, of respect for the snake,
<span id="line7992"></span>which seems to be a survival of ancestor worship, such as still exists
<span id="line7993"></span>among the Zulus and other savage tribes; the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>house-snake,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> as it is
<span id="line7994"></span>called, cares for the cows and the children, and its appearance is an
<span id="line7995"></span>omen of death, and the life of a pair of house-snakes is often held to
<span id="line7996"></span>be bound up with that of the master and mistress themselves. Tradition
<span id="line7997"></span>says that one of the Gnostic sects known as the Ophites caused a tame
<span id="line7998"></span>serpent to coil round the sacramental bread and worshipped it as the

<span id="line8041"></span>used for fumigation and in perfumery. Its specific gravity varies from
<span id="line8042"></span>1.054 to 1.057. It melts readily over the fire, and softens even with
<span id="line8043"></span>the heat of the mouth; it is insoluble in water, and nearly so in cold
<span id="line8044"></span>alcohol. It is allied to copal in its

<span id="line8054"></span>to the definition of Dr. E. B. Tylor, the doctrine of spiritual
<span id="line8055"></span>beings, including human souls; in practice, however, the term is often
<span id="line8056"></span>extended to include panthelism or animatism, the doctrine that a
<span id="line8057"></span>great part, if not the whole, of the inanimate kingdom, as well as all
<span id="line8058"></span>animated beings, are endowed with reason, intelligence and volition,
<span id="line8059"></span>identical with that of man. This latter theory, which in many cases
<span id="line8060"></span>is equivalent to personification, though it may be, like animism, a
<span id="line8061"></span>feature of the philosophy of peoples of low culture, should not be
<span id="line8062"></span>confused with it. But it is difficult in practice to distinguish the
<span id="line8063"></span>two phases of thought and no clear account of animatism can yet be
<span id="line8064"></span>given, largely on the ground that no people has yet been discovered
<span id="line8065"></span>which has not already developed to a greater or less extent an
<span id="line8066"></span>animistic philosophy. On theoretical grounds it is probable that
<span id="line8067"></span>animatism preceded animism; but savage thought is no more consistent
<span id="line8068"></span>than that of civilized man; and it may well be that animistic and
<span id="line8069"></span>panthelistic doctrines are held simultaneously by the same person. In
<span id="line8070"></span>like manner one portion of the savage explanation of nature may have
<span id="line8071"></span>been originally animistic, another part animatistic.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8074"></span>animatism as a primitive explanation of many different phenomena; if
<span id="line8075"></span>animatism was originally applied to non-human or inanimate objects,
<span id="line8076"></span>animism may from the outset have been in vogue as a theory of the
<span id="line8077"></span>nature of man. Lists of phenomena from the contemplation of which the
<span id="line8078"></span>savage was led to believe in animism have been given by Dr. Tylor,
<span id="line8079"></span>Herbert Spencer, Mr. Andrew Lang and others; an animated controversy
<span id="line8080"></span>arose between the former as to the priority of their respective lists.
<span id="line8081"></span>Among these phenomena are: trance (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) and unconsciousness,
<span id="line8082"></span>sickness, death, clairvoyance (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), dreams (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>),
<span id="line8083"></span>apparitions (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>) of the dead, wraiths, hallucinations
<span id="line8084"></span>(</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), echoes, shadows and reflections.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8085"></span>
<span id="line8086"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Primitive ideas on the subject of the soul, and at the same time
<span id="line8087"></span>the origin of them, are best illustrated by an analysis of the terms
<span id="line8088"></span>applied to it. Readers of Dante know the idea that the dead have
<span id="line8089"></span>no shadows; this was no invention of the poet's but a piece of
<span id="line8090"></span>traditionary lore; at the present day among the Basutos it is held
<span id="line8091"></span>that a man walking by the brink of a river may lose his life if his
<span id="line8092"></span>shadow falls on the water, for a crocodile may seize it and draw him
<span id="line8093"></span>in; in Tasmania, North and South America and classical Europe is found
<span id="line8094"></span>the conception that the soul<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#963;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#954;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#953;</span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>#8049;</span>, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>umbra</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>is somehow
<span id="line8095"></span>identical with the shadow of a man. More familiar to the Anglo-Saxon
<span id="line8096"></span>race is the connexion between the soul and the breath; this
<span id="line8097"></span>identification is found both in Aryan and Semitic languages; in
<span id="line8098"></span>Latin we have </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>spiritus</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, in Greek </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>pneuma</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, in Hebrew
<span id="line8099"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>ruach</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>; and the idea is found extending downwards to the lowest
<span id="line8100"></span>planes of culture in Australia, America and Asia. For some of the Red
<span id="line8101"></span>Indians the Roman custom of receiving the breath of a dying man was no
<span id="line8102"></span>mere pious duty but a means of ensuring that his soul was transferred
<span id="line8103"></span>to a new body. Other familiar conceptions identify the soul with the
<span id="line8104"></span>liver (see OMEN) or the heart, with the reflected figure seen in
<span id="line8105"></span>the pupil of the eye, and with the blood. Although the soul is often
<span id="line8106"></span>distinguished from the vital principle, there are many cases in which
<span id="line8107"></span>a state of unconsciousness is explained as due to the absence of the
<span id="line8108"></span>soul; in South Australia </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>wilyamarraba</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (without soul) is the
<span id="line8109"></span>word used for insensible. So too the autohypnotic trance of the
<span id="line8110"></span>magician or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>shaman</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> is regarded as due to his visit to distant
<span id="line8111"></span>regions or the nether world, of which he brings back an account.
<span id="line8112"></span>Telepathy or clairvoyance (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), with or without trance, must
<span id="line8113"></span>have operated powerfully to produce a conviction of the dual nature
<span id="line8114"></span>of man, for it seems probable that facts unknown to the automatist are
<span id="line8115"></span>sometimes discovered by means of crystal-gazing (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), which
<span id="line8116"></span>is widely found among savages, as among civilized peoples. Sickness
<span id="line8117"></span>is often explained as due to the absence of the soul; and means are
<span id="line8118"></span>sometimes taken to lure back the wandering soul; when a Chinese is at
<span id="line8119"></span>the point of death and his soul is supposed to have already left his
<span id="line8120"></span>body, the patient's coat is held up on a long bamboo while a priest
<span id="line8121"></span>endeavours to bring the departed spirit back into the coat by means of
<span id="line8122"></span>incantations. If the bamboo begins to turn round in the hands of the
<span id="line8123"></span>relative who is deputed to hold it, it is regarded as a sign that the
<span id="line8124"></span>soul of the moribund has returned (see AUTOMATISM). More important
<span id="line8125"></span>perhaps than all these phenomena, because more regular and normal, was
<span id="line8126"></span>the daily period of sleep with its frequent concomitant of fitful
<span id="line8127"></span>and incoherent ideas and images. The mere immobility of the body
<span id="line8128"></span>was sufficient to show that its state was not identical with that of
<span id="line8129"></span>waking; when, in addition, the sleeper awoke to give an account
<span id="line8130"></span>of visits to distant lands, from which, as modern psychical
<span id="line8131"></span>investigations suggest, he may even have brought back veridical
<span id="line8132"></span>details, the conclusion must have been irresistible that in sleep
<span id="line8133"></span>something journeyed forth, which was not the body. In a minor
<span id="line8134"></span>degree revival of memory during sleep and similar phenomena of the
<span id="line8135"></span>sub-conscious life may have contributed to the same result. Dreams are
<span id="line8136"></span>sometimes explained by savages as journeys performed by the sleeper,
<span id="line8137"></span>sometimes as visits paid by other persons, by animals or objects to
<span id="line8138"></span>him; hallucinations, possibly more frequent in the lower stages of
<span id="line8139"></span>culture, must have contributed to fortify this interpretation, and the
<span id="line8140"></span>animistic theory in general. Seeing the phantasmic figures of friends
<span id="line8141"></span>at the moment when they were, whether at the point of death or in good
<span id="line8142"></span>health, many miles distant, must have led the savage irresistibly to
<span id="line8143"></span>the dualistic theory. But hallucinatory figures, both in dreams
<span id="line8144"></span>and waking life, are not necessarily those of the living; from the
<span id="line8145"></span>reappearance of dead friends or enemies primitive man was inevitably
<span id="line8146"></span>led to the belief that there existed an incorporeal part of man which
<span id="line8147"></span>survived the dissolution of the body. The soul was conceived to be
<span id="line8148"></span>a facsimile of the body, sometimes no less material, sometimes
<span id="line8149"></span>more subtle but yet material, sometimes altogether impalpable and
<span id="line8150"></span>intangible.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8151"></span>
<span id="line8152"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Animism and Eschatology</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>The psychological side of animism has
<span id="line8153"></span>already been dealt with; almost equally important in primitive creeds
<span id="line8154"></span>is the eschatological aspect. In many parts of the world it is held
<span id="line8155"></span>that the human body is the seat of more than one soul; in the island
<span id="line8156"></span>of Nias four are distinguished, the shadow and the intelligence,
<span id="line8157"></span>which die with the body, a tutelary spirit, termed </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>begoe</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, and a
<span id="line8158"></span>second which is carried on the head. Similar ideas are found among the
<span id="line8159"></span>Euahlayi of S.E. Australia, the Dakotas and many other tribes. Just as
<span id="line8160"></span>in Europe the ghost of a dead person is held to haunt the churchyard
<span id="line8161"></span>or the place of death, although more orthodox ideas may be held and
<span id="line8162"></span>enunciated by the same person as to the nature of a future life,
<span id="line8163"></span>so the savage, more consistently, assigns different abodes to the
<span id="line8164"></span>multiple souls with which he credits man. Of the four souls of a
<span id="line8165"></span>Dakota, one is held to stay with the corpse, another in the village,
<span id="line8166"></span>a third goes into the air, while the fourth goes to the land of souls,
<span id="line8167"></span>where its lot may depend on its rank in this life, its sex, mode of
<span id="line8168"></span>death or sepulture, on the due observance of funeral ritual, or many
<span id="line8169"></span>other points (see ESCHATOLOGY). From the belief in the survival of the
<span id="line8170"></span>dead arose the practice of offering food, lighting fires, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., at the
<span id="line8171"></span>grave, at first, maybe, as an act of friendship or filial piety, later
<span id="line8172"></span>as an act of worship (see ANCESTOR WORSHIP). The simple offering of
<span id="line8173"></span>food or shedding of blood at the grave develops into an elaborate
<span id="line8174"></span>system of sacrifice; even where ancestor-worship is not found, the
<span id="line8175"></span>desire to provide the dead with comforts in the future life may lead
<span id="line8176"></span>to the sacrifice of wives, slaves, animals, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c., to the breaking or
<span id="line8177"></span>burning of objects at the grave or to the provision of the ferryman's
<span id="line8178"></span>toll, a coin put in the mouth of the corpse to pay the travelling
<span id="line8179"></span>expenses of the soul. But all is not finished with the passage of the
<span id="line8180"></span>soul to the land of the dead; the soul may return to avenge its death
<span id="line8181"></span>by helping to discover the murderer, or to wreak vengeance for itself;
<span id="line8182"></span>there is a widespread belief that those who die a violent death become
<span id="line8183"></span>malignant spirits and endanger the lives of those who come near
<span id="line8184"></span>the haunted spot; the woman who dies in child-birth becomes a
<span id="line8185"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>pontianak</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, and threatens the life of human beings; and man
<span id="line8186"></span>resorts to magical or religious means of repelling his spiritual
<span id="line8187"></span>dangers.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8190"></span>suggested above, of great importance for the development of animism,
<span id="line8191"></span>the belief, which must originally have been a doctrine of human
<span id="line8192"></span>psychology, cannot have failed to expand speedily into
<span id="line8193"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0054</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0054</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0054]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8194"></span>a general philosophy of nature. Not only human beings
<span id="line8195"></span>but animals and objects are seen in dreams; and the conclusion would
<span id="line8196"></span>be that they too have souls; the same conclusion may have been reached
<span id="line8197"></span>by another line of argument; primitive psychology posited a spirit
<span id="line8198"></span>in a man to account, amongst other things, for his actions; a natural
<span id="line8199"></span>explanation of the changes in the external world would be that they
<span id="line8200"></span>are due to the operations and volitions of spirits.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8201"></span>
<span id="line8202"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Animal Souls.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>But apart from considerations of this sort,
<span id="line8203"></span>it is probable that animals must, early in the history of animistic
<span id="line8204"></span>beliefs, have been regarded as possessing souls. Education has brought
<span id="line8205"></span>with it a sense of the great gulf between man and animals; but in the
<span id="line8206"></span>lower stages of culture this distinction is not adequately recognized,
<span id="line8207"></span>if indeed it is recognized at all. The savage attributes to animals
<span id="line8208"></span>the same ideas, the same mental processes as himself, and at the same
<span id="line8209"></span>time vastly greater power and cunning. The dead animal is credited
<span id="line8210"></span>with a knowledge of how its remains are treated and sometimes with a
<span id="line8211"></span>power of taking vengeance on the fortunate hunter. Powers of reasoning
<span id="line8212"></span>are not denied to animals nor even speech; the silence of the brute
<span id="line8213"></span>creation may be put down to their superior cunning. We may assume that
<span id="line8214"></span>man attributed a soul to the beasts of the field almost as soon as he
<span id="line8215"></span>claimed one for himself. It is therefore not surprising to find that
<span id="line8216"></span>many peoples on the lower planes of culture respect and even worship
<span id="line8217"></span>animals (see TOTEM; ANIMAL WORSHIP); though we need not attribute
<span id="line8218"></span>an animistic origin to all the developments, it is clear that the
<span id="line8219"></span>widespread respect paid to animals as the abode of dead ancestors, and
<span id="line8220"></span>much of the cult of dangerous animals, is traceable to this principle.
<span id="line8221"></span>With the rise of species, deities and the cult of individual animals,
<span id="line8222"></span>the path towards anthropomorphization and polytheism is opened and the
<span id="line8223"></span>respect paid to animals tends to lose its strict animistic character.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8224"></span>
<span id="line8225"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Plant Souls.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>Just as human souls are assigned to animals, so
<span id="line8226"></span>primitive man often credits trees and plants with souls in both human
<span id="line8227"></span>or animal form. All over the world agricultural peoples practise
<span id="line8228"></span>elaborate ceremonies explicable, as Mannhardt has shown, on animistic
<span id="line8229"></span>principles. In Europe the corn spirit sometimes immanent in the crop,
<span id="line8230"></span>sometimes a presiding deity whose life does not depend on that of the
<span id="line8231"></span>growing corn, is conceived in some districts in the form of an ox,
<span id="line8232"></span>hare or cock, in others as an old man or woman; in the East Indies
<span id="line8233"></span>and America the rice or maize mother is a corresponding figure; in
<span id="line8234"></span>classical Europe and the East we have in Ceres and Demeter, Adonis
<span id="line8235"></span>and Dionysus, and other deities, vegetation gods whose origin we can
<span id="line8236"></span>readily trace back to the rustic corn spirit. Forest trees, no less
<span id="line8237"></span>than cereals, have their indwelling spirits; the fauns and satyrs
<span id="line8238"></span>of classical literature were goat-footed and the tree spirit of the
<span id="line8239"></span>Russian peasantry takes the form of a goat; in Bengal and the East
<span id="line8240"></span>Indies wood-cutters endeavour to propitiate the spirit of the tree
<span id="line8241"></span>which they cut down; and in many parts of the world trees are
<span id="line8242"></span>regarded as the abode of the spirits of the dead. Just as a process of
<span id="line8243"></span>syncretism has given rise to cults of animal gods, tree spirits tend
<span id="line8244"></span>to become detached from the trees, which are thenceforward only their
<span id="line8245"></span>abodes; and here again animism has begun to pass into polytheism.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8247"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Object Souls.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span><span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>mdash;</span>We distinguish between animate and inanimate
<span id="line8248"></span>nature, but this classification has no meaning for the savage. The
<span id="line8249"></span>river speeding on its course to the sea, the sun and moon, if not the
<span id="line8250"></span>stars also, on their never-ceasing daily round, the lightning, fire,
<span id="line8251"></span>the wind, the sea, all are in motion and therefore animate; but the
<span id="line8252"></span>savage does not stop short here; mountains and lakes, stones and
<span id="line8253"></span>manufactured articles, are for him alike endowed with souls like his
<span id="line8254"></span>own; he deposits in the tomb weapons and food, clothes and implements,
<span id="line8255"></span>broken, it may be, in order to set free their souls; or he attains the
<span id="line8256"></span>same result by burning them, and thus sending them to the Other World
<span id="line8257"></span>for the use of the dead man. Here again, though to a less extent
<span id="line8258"></span>than in tree cults, the theriomorphic aspect recurs; in the north
<span id="line8259"></span>of Europe, in ancient Greece, in China, the water or river spirit is
<span id="line8260"></span>horse or bull-shaped; the water monster in serpent shape is even more
<span id="line8261"></span>widely found, but it is less strictly the spirit of the water. The
<span id="line8262"></span>spirit of syncretism manifests itself in this department of animism
<span id="line8263"></span>too; the immanent spirit of the earlier period becomes the presiding
<span id="line8264"></span>genius or local god of later times, and with the rise of the doctrine
<span id="line8265"></span>of separable souls we again reach the confines of animism pure and
<span id="line8266"></span>simple.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8269"></span>separable souls with which we have so far been concerned, exists the
<span id="line8270"></span>belief in a great host of unattached spirits; these are not immanent
<span id="line8271"></span>souls which have become detached from their abodes, but have every
<span id="line8272"></span>appearance of independent spirits. Thus, animism is in some directions
<span id="line8273"></span>little developed, so far as we can see, among the Australian
<span id="line8274"></span>aborigines; but from those who know them best we learn that they
<span id="line8275"></span>believe in innumerable spirits and bush bogies, which wander,
<span id="line8276"></span>especially at night, and can be held at bay by means of fire; with
<span id="line8277"></span>this belief may be compared the ascription in European folk belief
<span id="line8278"></span>of prophylactic properties to iron. These spirits are at first mainly
<span id="line8279"></span>malevolent; and side by side with them we find the spirits of the dead
<span id="line8280"></span>as hostile beings. At a higher stage the spirits of dead kinsmen are
<span id="line8281"></span>no longer unfriendly, nor yet all non-human spirits; as fetishes (see
<span id="line8282"></span>FETISHISM), naguals (see TOTEM), familiars, gods or demi-gods (for
<span id="line8283"></span>which and the general question see DEMONOLOGY), they enter into
<span id="line8284"></span>relations with man. On the other hand there still subsists a belief in
<span id="line8285"></span>innumerable evil spirits, which manifest themselves in the phenomena
<span id="line8286"></span>of possession (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), lycanthropy (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), disease, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>c.
<span id="line8287"></span>The fear of evil spirits has given rise to ceremonies of expulsion of
<span id="line8288"></span>evils (see EXORCISM), designed to banish them from the community.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8291"></span>most primitive form of religion; but properly speaking it is not
<span id="line8292"></span>a religion at all, for religion implies, at any rate, some form
<span id="line8293"></span>of emotion (see RELIGION), and animism is in the first instance an
<span id="line8294"></span>explanation of phenomena rather than an attitude of mind toward the
<span id="line8295"></span>cause of them, a philosophy rather than a religion. The term may,
<span id="line8296"></span>however, be conveniently used to describe the early stage of religion
<span id="line8297"></span>in which man endeavours to set up relations between himself and the
<span id="line8298"></span>unseen powers, conceived as spirits, but differing in many particulars
<span id="line8299"></span>from the gods of polytheism. As an example of this stage in one of its
<span id="line8300"></span>aspects may be taken the European belief in the corn spirit, which is,
<span id="line8301"></span>however, the object of magical rather than religious rites; Dr. Frazer
<span id="line8302"></span>has thus defined the character of the animistic pantheon, <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>they are
<span id="line8303"></span>restricted in their operations to definite departments of nature;
<span id="line8304"></span>their names are general, not proper; their attributes are generic
<span id="line8305"></span>rather than individual; in other words, there is an indefinite number
<span id="line8306"></span>of spirits of each class, and the individuals of a class are much
<span id="line8307"></span>alike; they have no definitely marked individuality; no accepted
<span id="line8308"></span>traditions are current as to their origin, life and character.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> This
<span id="line8309"></span>stage of religion is well illustrated by the Red Indian custom
<span id="line8310"></span>of offering sacrifice to certain rocks, or whirlpools, or to the
<span id="line8311"></span>indwelling spirits connected with them; the rite is only performed in
<span id="line8312"></span>the neighbourhood of the object, it is an incident of a canoe or
<span id="line8313"></span>other voyage, and is not intended to secure any benefits beyond a safe
<span id="line8314"></span>passage past the object in question; the spirit to be propitiated
<span id="line8315"></span>has a purely local sphere of influence, and powers of a very limited
<span id="line8316"></span>nature. Animistic in many of their features too are the temporary gods
<span id="line8317"></span>of fetishism (</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>q.v.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>), naguals or familiars, genii and even the
<span id="line8318"></span>dead who receive a cult. With the rise of a belief in departmental
<span id="line8319"></span>gods comes the age of polytheism; the belief in elemental spirits may
<span id="line8320"></span>still persist, but they fall into the background and receive no cult.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8323"></span>the origin of religion have been put forward, the one, often termed
<span id="line8324"></span>the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>ghost theory,<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> mainly associated with the name of Herbert
<span id="line8325"></span>Spencer, but also maintained by Grant Allen, refers the beginning of
<span id="line8326"></span>religion to the cult of dead human beings; the other, put forward by
<span id="line8327"></span>Dr. E. B. Tylor, makes the foundation of all religion animistic, but
<span id="line8328"></span>recognizes the non-human character of polytheistic gods. Although
<span id="line8329"></span>ancestor-worship, or, more broadly, the cult of the dead, has in many
<span id="line8330"></span>cases overshadowed other cults or even extinguished them, we have no
<span id="line8331"></span>warrant, even in these cases, for asserting its priority, but rather
<span id="line8332"></span>the reverse; not only so, but in the majority of cases the pantheon is
<span id="line8333"></span>made up by a multitude of spirits in human, sometimes in animal form,
<span id="line8334"></span>which bear no signs of ever having been incarnate; sun gods and moon
<span id="line8335"></span>goddesses, </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">span</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">pagenum</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">a</span> <span class="attribute-name">name</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0055</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">v.02_01_0055</a>"&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">a</span>&gt;</span><span>[v.02 p.0055]</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">span</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8336"></span>gods of fire, wind and water, gods of the sea, and above
<span id="line8337"></span>all gods of the sky, show no signs of having been ghost gods at any
<span id="line8338"></span>period in their history. They may, it is true, be associated with
<span id="line8339"></span>ghost gods, but in Australia it cannot even be asserted that the gods
<span id="line8340"></span>are spirits at all, much less that they are the spirits of dead men;
<span id="line8341"></span>they are simply magnified magicians, super-men who have never died; we
<span id="line8342"></span>have no ground, therefore, for regarding the cult of the dead as the
<span id="line8343"></span>origin of religion in this area; this conclusion is the more probable,
<span id="line8344"></span>as ancestor-worship and the cult of the dead generally cannot be said
<span id="line8345"></span>to exist in Australia.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line8346"></span>
<span id="line8347"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The more general view that polytheistic and other gods are the
<span id="line8348"></span>elemental and other spirits of the later stages of animistic creeds,
<span id="line8349"></span>is equally inapplicable to Australia, where the belief seems to be
<span id="line8350"></span>neither animistic nor even animatistic in character. But we are
<span id="line8351"></span>hardly justified in arguing from the case of Australia to a general
<span id="line8352"></span>conclusion as to the origin of religious ideas in all other parts of
<span id="line8353"></span>the world. It is perhaps safest to say that the science of religions
<span id="line8354"></span>has no data on which to go, in formulating conclusions as to the
<span id="line8355"></span>original form of the objects of religious emotion; in this connexion
<span id="line8356"></span>it must be remembered that not only is it very difficult to get
<span id="line8357"></span>precise information of the subject of the religious ideas of people of
<span id="line8358"></span>low culture, perhaps for the simple reason that the ideas themselves
<span id="line8359"></span>are far from precise, but also that, as has been pointed out above,
<span id="line8360"></span>the conception of spiritual often approximates very closely to that of
<span id="line8361"></span>material. Where the soul is regarded as no more than a finer sort of
<span id="line8362"></span>matter, it will obviously be far from easy to decide whether the gods
<span id="line8363"></span>are spiritual or material. Even, therefore, if we can say that at the
<span id="line8364"></span>present day the gods are entirely spiritual, it is clearly possible to
<span id="line8365"></span>maintain that they have been spiritualized </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>pari passu</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> with
<span id="line8366"></span>the increasing importance of the animistic view of nature and of the
<span id="line8367"></span>greater prominence of eschatological beliefs. The animistic origin of
<span id="line8368"></span>religion is therefore not proven.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8372"></span>of mythology has an animistic basis, it is possible to believe,
<span id="line8373"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>e.g.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> in a sky world, peopled by corporeal beings, as well as
<span id="line8374"></span>by spirits of the dead; the latter may even be entirely absent;
<span id="line8375"></span>the mythology of the Australians relates largely to corporeal,
<span id="line8376"></span>non-spiritual beings; stories of transformation, deluge and doom
<span id="line8377"></span>myths, or myths of the origin of death, have not necessarily any
<span id="line8378"></span>animistic basis. At the same time, with the rise of ideas as to a
<span id="line8379"></span>future life and spiritual beings, this field of mythology is immensely
<span id="line8380"></span>widened, though it cannot be said that a rich mythology is necessarily
<span id="line8381"></span>genetically associated with or combined with belief in many spiritual
<span id="line8382"></span>beings.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8385"></span>to many different philosophical systems. It is used to describe
<span id="line8386"></span>Aristotle's view of the relation of soul and body held also by the
<span id="line8387"></span>Stoics and Scholastics. On the other hand monadology (Leibnitz) has
<span id="line8388"></span>also been termed animistic. The name is most commonly applied to
<span id="line8389"></span>vitalism, a view mainly associated with G. E. Stahl and revived by
<span id="line8390"></span>F. Bouillier (1813-1899), which makes life, or life and mind, the
<span id="line8391"></span>directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that all cannot
<span id="line8392"></span>be traced back to chemical and mechanical processes, but that there is
<span id="line8393"></span>a directive force which guides energy without altering its amount.
<span id="line8394"></span>An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the
<span id="line8395"></span>belief in the world soul, held by Plato, Schelling and others.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span id="line8415"></span>the last years of the 15th century. At the request of St. Filippo Neri
<span id="line8416"></span>he composed a number of </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Laudi</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, or hymns of praise, to be sung
<span id="line8417"></span>after sermon time, which have given him an accidental prominence
<span id="line8418"></span>in musical history, since their performance in St. Filippo's Oratory
<span id="line8419"></span>eventually gave rise (on the disruption of 16th century schools of
<span id="line8420"></span>composition) to those early forms of <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span>oratorio<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>quot;</span> that are not traceable

<span id="line8422"></span>so warmly that he declared he had seen the soul of his friend fly
<span id="line8423"></span>upwards towards heaven. In 1555 Animuccia was appointed </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>maestro di

<span id="line8425"></span>in 1571. He was succeeded by Palestrina, who had been his friend and
<span id="line8426"></span>probably his pupil. The manuscript of many of Animuccia's compositions
<span id="line8427"></span>is still preserved in the Vatican Library. His chief published works

<span id="line8450"></span>by the name of aniseed, and has a strong aromatic taste and a powerful
<span id="line8451"></span>odour. By distillation the fruit yields the volatile oil of anise,
<span id="line8452"></span>which is useful in the treatment of flatulence and colic in children.
<span id="line8453"></span>It may be given as </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Aqua Anisi</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, in doses of one or more ounces,
<span id="line8454"></span>or as the </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Spiritus Anisi</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, in doses of 5-20 minims. The main
<span id="line8455"></span>constituent of the oil (up to 90%) is anethol, C</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sub</span>&gt;</span><span>10</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sub</span>&gt;</span><span>H</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">sub</span>&gt;</span><span>12</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">sub</span>&gt;</span><span>O or

It also contains methyl
<span id="line8457"></span>chavicol, anisic aldehyde, anisic acid, and a terpene. Most of the oil
<span id="line8458"></span>of commerce, however, of which anethol is also the chief constituent,
<span id="line8459"></span>comes from </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Illicium verum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> (order </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Magnoliaceae</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>, sub-order

<span id="line8462"></span>its fruit spreading out like a star. The anise of the Bible (Matt.
<span id="line8463"></span>xxiii. 23) is </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Anethum</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span> or </span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>Peucedanum graveolens</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">i</span>&gt;</span><span>,

<span id="line8518"></span>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
<span id="line8519"></span>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
<span id="line8520"></span>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project

<span id="line8526"></span>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8527"></span>electronic works
<span id="line8528"></span>
<span id="line8529"></span>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8530"></span>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
<span id="line8531"></span>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
<span id="line8532"></span>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
<span id="line8533"></span>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
<span id="line8534"></span>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
<span id="line8535"></span>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
<span id="line8536"></span>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
<span id="line8537"></span>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
<span id="line8538"></span>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
<span id="line8539"></span>
<span id="line8540"></span>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
<span id="line8541"></span>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
<span id="line8542"></span>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
<span id="line8543"></span>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<span id="line8544"></span>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
<span id="line8545"></span>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<span id="line8546"></span>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
<span id="line8547"></span>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<span id="line8548"></span>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
<span id="line8549"></span>
<span id="line8550"></span>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
<span id="line8551"></span>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
<span id="line8552"></span>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
<span id="line8553"></span>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
<span id="line8554"></span>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
<span id="line8555"></span>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
<span id="line8556"></span>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
<span id="line8557"></span>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
<span id="line8558"></span>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
<span id="line8559"></span>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
<span id="line8560"></span>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
<span id="line8561"></span>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
<span id="line8562"></span>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
<span id="line8563"></span>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
<span id="line8564"></span>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
<span id="line8565"></span>
<span id="line8566"></span>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<span id="line8567"></span>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
<span id="line8568"></span>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
<span id="line8569"></span>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
<span id="line8570"></span>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
<span id="line8571"></span>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
<span id="line8572"></span>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
<span id="line8573"></span>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
<span id="line8574"></span>States.
<span id="line8575"></span>
<span id="line8576"></span>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<span id="line8577"></span>
<span id="line8578"></span>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
<span id="line8579"></span>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
<span id="line8580"></span>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
<span id="line8581"></span>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
<span id="line8582"></span>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
<span id="line8583"></span>copied or distributed:
<span id="line8584"></span>
<span id="line8585"></span>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
<span id="line8586"></span>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
<span id="line8587"></span>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
<span id="line8588"></span>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
<span id="line8589"></span>
<span id="line8590"></span>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
<span id="line8591"></span>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
<span id="line8592"></span>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
<span id="line8593"></span>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
<span id="line8594"></span>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
<span id="line8595"></span>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
<span id="line8596"></span>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
<span id="line8597"></span>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
<span id="line8598"></span>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
<span id="line8599"></span>1.E.9.
<span id="line8600"></span>
<span id="line8601"></span>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
<span id="line8602"></span>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
<span id="line8603"></span>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
<span id="line8604"></span>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
<span id="line8605"></span>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
<span id="line8606"></span>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
<span id="line8607"></span>
<span id="line8608"></span>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8609"></span>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
<span id="line8610"></span>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
<span id="line8611"></span>
<span id="line8612"></span>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
<span id="line8613"></span>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
<span id="line8614"></span>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
<span id="line8615"></span>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
<span id="line8616"></span>Gutenberg-tm License.

<span id="line8618"></span>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
<span id="line8619"></span>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
<span id="line8620"></span>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
<span id="line8621"></span>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
<span id="line8622"></span>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
<span id="line8623"></span>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
<span id="line8624"></span>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
<span id="line8625"></span>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
<span id="line8626"></span>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
<span id="line8627"></span>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8628"></span>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
<span id="line8629"></span>
<span id="line8630"></span>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
<span id="line8631"></span>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
<span id="line8632"></span>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
<span id="line8633"></span>
<span id="line8634"></span>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
<span id="line8635"></span>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
<span id="line8636"></span>that
<span id="line8637"></span>
<span id="line8638"></span>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
<span id="line8639"></span>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
<span id="line8640"></span>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
<span id="line8641"></span>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
<span id="line8642"></span>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
<span id="line8643"></span>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
<span id="line8644"></span>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
<span id="line8645"></span>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
<span id="line8646"></span>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
<span id="line8647"></span>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
<span id="line8648"></span>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
<span id="line8649"></span>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
<span id="line8650"></span>
<span id="line8651"></span>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
<span id="line8652"></span>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
<span id="line8653"></span>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8654"></span>     License.  You must require such a user to return or
<span id="line8655"></span>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
<span id="line8656"></span>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
<span id="line8657"></span>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<span id="line8658"></span>
<span id="line8659"></span>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

<span id="line8668"></span>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
<span id="line8669"></span>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

<span id="line8673"></span>
<span id="line8674"></span>1.F.
<span id="line8675"></span>
<span id="line8676"></span>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<span id="line8677"></span>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<span id="line8678"></span>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8679"></span>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<span id="line8680"></span>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<span id="line8681"></span>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<span id="line8682"></span>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<span id="line8683"></span>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<span id="line8684"></span>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

<span id="line8692"></span>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<span id="line8693"></span>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<span id="line8694"></span>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<span id="line8695"></span>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<span id="line8696"></span>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<span id="line8697"></span>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<span id="line8698"></span>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<span id="line8699"></span>DAMAGE.
<span id="line8700"></span>
<span id="line8701"></span>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<span id="line8702"></span>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<span id="line8703"></span>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<span id="line8704"></span>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
<span id="line8705"></span>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<span id="line8706"></span>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<span id="line8707"></span>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<span id="line8708"></span>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<span id="line8709"></span>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<span id="line8710"></span>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<span id="line8711"></span>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<span id="line8712"></span>opportunities to fix the problem.
<span id="line8713"></span>
<span id="line8714"></span>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
<span id="line8715"></span>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
<span id="line8716"></span>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
<span id="line8717"></span>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
<span id="line8718"></span>
<span id="line8719"></span>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
<span id="line8720"></span>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
<span id="line8721"></span>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
<span id="line8722"></span>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
<span id="line8723"></span>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
<span id="line8724"></span>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
<span id="line8725"></span>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
<span id="line8726"></span>
<span id="line8727"></span>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<span id="line8728"></span>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<span id="line8729"></span>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<span id="line8730"></span>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
<span id="line8731"></span>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
<span id="line8732"></span>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

<span id="line8739"></span>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8740"></span>
<span id="line8741"></span>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<span id="line8742"></span>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<span id="line8743"></span>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<span id="line8744"></span>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<span id="line8745"></span>people in all walks of life.
<span id="line8746"></span>
<span id="line8747"></span>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<span id="line8748"></span>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<span id="line8749"></span>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<span id="line8750"></span>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<span id="line8751"></span>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<span id="line8752"></span>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<span id="line8753"></span>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<span id="line8754"></span>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

<span id="line8784"></span>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<span id="line8785"></span>Literary Archive Foundation
<span id="line8786"></span>
<span id="line8787"></span>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<span id="line8788"></span>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<span id="line8789"></span>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<span id="line8790"></span>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<span id="line8791"></span>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<span id="line8792"></span>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<span id="line8793"></span>status with the IRS.
<span id="line8794"></span>
<span id="line8795"></span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<span id="line8796"></span>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<span id="line8797"></span>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<span id="line8798"></span>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<span id="line8799"></span>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<span id="line8800"></span>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<span id="line8801"></span>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<span id="line8802"></span>particular state visit http://pglaf.org
<span id="line8803"></span>
<span id="line8804"></span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<span id="line8805"></span>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<span id="line8806"></span>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<span id="line8807"></span>approach us with offers to donate.
<span id="line8808"></span>
<span id="line8809"></span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<span id="line8810"></span>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<span id="line8811"></span>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<span id="line8812"></span>
<span id="line8813"></span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<span id="line8814"></span>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<span id="line8815"></span>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
<span id="line8816"></span>donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

<span id="line8819"></span>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<span id="line8820"></span>works.
<span id="line8821"></span>
<span id="line8822"></span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<span id="line8823"></span>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<span id="line8824"></span>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<span id="line8825"></span>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<span id="line8826"></span>
<span id="line8827"></span>
<span id="line8828"></span>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<span id="line8829"></span>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<span id="line8830"></span>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<span id="line8831"></span>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
