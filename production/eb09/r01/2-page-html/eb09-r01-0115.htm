<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">town is well built, with wide and regular streets and many good villas in the suburbs. Of the magnificent&nbsp;Benedictine abbey founded in 1121 by King Henry I.,&nbsp;originally one of the three wealthiest in England, all that&nbsp;now remains is a mass of ruins (with the exception of the&nbsp;gateway, which was restored in 1861 and is now carefully&nbsp;preserved), a portion of the great hall (in which several&nbsp;parliaments have been held), and the foundation of the&nbsp;Norman apsidal chapel. Henry I., who died at Rouen,&nbsp;was buried within its precincts; but his monument was&nbsp;destroyed in the time of Edward VI.; and John of Gaunt&nbsp;was married there to Blanche of Lancaster in 1359. By&nbsp;Henry VIII. it was converted into a palace, which formed&nbsp;the occasional residence of subsequent sovereigns until its&nbsp;destruction during the Cromwellian wars. Of other old&nbsp;ecclesiastical buildings of special interest the principal are&nbsp;Greyfriars’ church, completed about 1311, formerly the&nbsp;church of Greyfriars’ monastery, but after the dissolution&nbsp;used successively as a town-hall, a workhouse, and a jail,&nbsp;until it was restored to its original use in 1864 ; St Mary’s&nbsp;church, rebuilt, according to Camden, in 1551 from the&nbsp;ruins of a nunnery founded by Elfrida to expiate the&nbsp;murder of her stepson (Edward the Martyr); the church&nbsp;of St Lawrence, originally Norman, but rebuilt in the&nbsp;15th century in the Early English style, containing some&nbsp;interesting brasses; and the church of St Giles, of mixed&nbsp;architecture, which was severely damaged during the&nbsp;Cromwellian wars. At the free grammar-school, founded&nbsp;in 1445, Archbishop Laud received his education, and he&nbsp;afterwards became a generous benefactor to it. The&nbsp;school was removed in 1871 to new buildings surrounded&nbsp;by 12 acres of ground. Other educational foundations&nbsp;are the Kendrick schools (1624), the blue-coat school&nbsp;(1656), and the green-coat school for girls (1779). The&nbsp;various almshouses were consolidated into one building in&nbsp;1865. Among the modern structures are the municipal&nbsp;buildings (in the Renaissance style, erected in 1875 and&nbsp;enlarged in 1882, containing a large concert-room, a free&nbsp;library, schools for science and art, and a museum), the corn&nbsp;exchange, the assize courts, the athenaeum, the royal Albert&nbsp;hall, the masonic hall, the workhouse, and the royal Berkshire hospital. The town has a large trade in corn and agricultural produce ; and, in addition to an extensive biscuit&nbsp;manufactory which employs over 3000 hands, it possesses&nbsp;iron-works, iron-foundries, engine works, and breweries.&nbsp;Adjoining the town are extensive seed nurseries covering&nbsp;about 10,000 acres. The population of the borough (area,&nbsp;2186 acres) in 1871 was 32,324, and in 1881 it was 42,054.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The origin of the town is doubtful ; but Reading must have been a place of some importance when the Danes in 871 brought their&nbsp;war-ships up the Thames as far as the Kennet and made the town&nbsp;for some time their headquarters. It was burned by Sweyn in&nbsp;1006. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Domesday</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the name occurs as Radynges. A new and&nbsp;strong castle was erected here by Stephen, which was destroyed by&nbsp;Henry II. In 1209 the professors and students of Oxford made a&nbsp;temporary retreat to Reading, owing to a quarrel with King John.&nbsp;From the 13th to the 16th century parliaments were frequent!}<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>held in the town, and in the Michaelmas term of 1625 the law&nbsp;courts were transferred to it on account of the prevalence of the&nbsp;plague in London. In 1643 it surrendered to the Parliamentary&nbsp;forces under the earl of Essex, and subsequently was more than&nbsp;once occupied by the rival armies. It is a borough by prescription&nbsp;and received charters and grants from Henry III. and subsequent&nbsp;sovereigns. It has returned members to parliament from the 23d&nbsp;of Edward I. ; the number was reduced from two to one in 1885.&nbsp;By the Municipal Act of 1836 it was divided into three wards&nbsp;governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">READING, a city of the United States, capital of Berks county, Pennsylvania, on the east bank of the&nbsp;Schuylkill river, and on the Schuylkill and Union Canals,&nbsp;58 miles north-west of Philadelphia at the intersection of&nbsp;some fourteen railway lines, representing eight different&nbsp;companies. It occupies an elevated and healthy position</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">on a plain that gradually rises towards an amphitheatre of hills, including Penn’s Mount on the east and Neversink&nbsp;Mountain on the south. The plan is extremely regular&nbsp;and the principal streets cross at Penn Square, the business&nbsp;centre of the city. An abundant supply of excellent&nbsp;water helps to keep the whole place sweet and clean.&nbsp;Conspicuous buildings are—the court-house, the city-hall,&nbsp;Trinity Church (Lutheran), Christ Church (Episcopal), the&nbsp;opera-house, Misliler’s academy of music, and the railway&nbsp;station. Besides a very extensive and varied manufacture&nbsp;of iron and iron wares from steam-boilers down to nails,&nbsp;Reading carries on distilling, tanning, cotton-weaving,&nbsp;cigar-rolling, paper-making, and many other industries,&nbsp;and is the seat of extensive machine-shops of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. The population—2385 in&nbsp;1800, 15,743 in 1850, 33,930 in 1870, and 43,278 in&nbsp;1880—is largely of German origin; and in 1883 one out&nbsp;of its five daily newspapers and six out of its eleven&nbsp;weeklies were in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Laid out in 1748 by Thomas and Richard Penn, Reading received incorporation as a borough in 1783, and was made a city in 1847.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RE ALE JO, a town and harbour on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, situated in the neighbourhood of 12° 28' N.&nbsp;lat. The harbour is spacious and well sheltered, and&nbsp;altogether the best which Nicaragua possesses on that&nbsp;coast; it is protected by a peninsula and two considerable&nbsp;islands, Cardon and Asserradores or Corinto. The town&nbsp;lies 9 miles inland, and as a port is now superseded by&nbsp;the new town of Corinto, founded about 1849, and since&nbsp;1881 connected with Leon and the interior by a railway.&nbsp;Realejo was the terminus adopted by Bedford Pirn for his&nbsp;scheme of an interoceanic canal; but the route actually&nbsp;sanctioned reaches the coast of the Pacific at Brito, some&nbsp;distance to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REAL ESTATE. The land law of England and of countries whose law is based upon that of England stands&nbsp;in a peculiar position, which can be understood only by an&nbsp;outline of its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Such terms as “ fee ” or “ homage ” carry us far back into feudal times. Rights of common and distress are based upon still older institutions, forming the&nbsp;very basis of primitive law. The conception of tenure&nbsp;is the most fundamental ground of distinction between&nbsp;real and personal estate, the former only being strictly entitled to the name of estate (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Estate). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The division&nbsp;into real and personal is coincident to a great extent with&nbsp;that into immovable and movable, generally used by&nbsp;systems of law founded on the Roman (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Personal&nbsp;Estate). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">That it is not entirely coincident is due to&nbsp;the influence of the Roman law itself. The Greeks and&nbsp;the Romans of the republic were essentially nations of&nbsp;citizens; the Teutons were essentially a nation of land-folk ; the Roman empire bridged the gulf between the two.&nbsp;It is probable that the English land law was produced by&nbsp;the action of the policy adopted in the lower empire,&nbsp;finally developed into feudalism, upon the previously existing course of Teutonic custom (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Feudalism). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It is&nbsp;sufficient to say here that the distinguishing features of&nbsp;the Teutonic system were enjoyment in common and the&nbsp;absence of private ownership, except to a limited extent.&nbsp;The history of the development of the old English land&nbsp;law before the Conquest will be found under </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">England </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Land. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Its principal features, stated as shortly as possible,&nbsp;were (1) liberty of alienation, either by will or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;of such land as could be alienated, chiefly, if not entirely,&nbsp;bocland, subject always to the limits fixed by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hoc·,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(2)&nbsp;publicity of transfer by enrolment in the shire-book or&nbsp;churcli-book ; (3) equal partition of the estate of a deceased&nbsp;among the sons, and failing sons among the daughters;&nbsp;(4) cultivation to a great extent by persons in various</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
