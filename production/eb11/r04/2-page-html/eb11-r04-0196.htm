<p><span class="font0">in action with gallantry and skill against the Indians. On the promotion of Colonel Wood to the command of the brigade,&nbsp;Mr Roosevelt became colonel of the regiment, which took an&nbsp;especially prominent part in the storming of San Juan Hill.&nbsp;In this battle Colonel Roosevelt became the ranking officer and,&nbsp;abandoning his horse, led the charge up the hill on foot under&nbsp;severe fire at the head of his troops. This charge, in which&nbsp;many of the “ Rough Riders &quot; were killed or wounded, drove&nbsp;the Spaniards from the trenches and opened the way to the&nbsp;surrender of Santiago. At the conclusion of the war, while&nbsp;the troops were still in camp in the South, Mr Roosevelt joined&nbsp;in a “ round robin &quot; of protest against the mismanagement&nbsp;in the War Department, which had resulted in widespread&nbsp;suffering among the troops from wretched food and bad sanitary&nbsp;arrangements. This “ round robin ” created a sensation which&nbsp;aroused public opinion and was instrumental in bringing about&nbsp;some desirable reforms in the War Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When his regiment was mustered out of service in September 1898, Mr Roosevelt was nominated by the Republican party&nbsp;for the governorship of New York State and was elected in&nbsp;November by a substantial plurality. He was governor for&nbsp;two years. He reformed the administration of the state canals,&nbsp;making the Canal Commission non-partisan; he introduced&nbsp;the merit system into many of the subordinate offices of the&nbsp;state; and he vigorously urged the passage of and signed&nbsp;the Ford Franchise Act (1899), taxing corporation franchises.&nbsp;In various contests, in which he was almost uniformly victorious,&nbsp;he showed himself to be independent of “ boss &quot; control. In&nbsp;1900, although he wished to serve another term as governor&nbsp;in order to complete and establish certain policies within the&nbsp;state, he was nominated for the vice-presidency of the United&nbsp;States on the ticket with President McKinley by the Republican&nbsp;National Convention in Philadelphia in spite of his protest.&nbsp;It was very commonly believed at the time that this nomination&nbsp;for the vice-presidency was participated in and heartily approved&nbsp;of by the machine politicians or “ bosses &quot; of the State of New&nbsp;York in their belief that it would result in his elimination from&nbsp;active political life. The office of vice-president of the United&nbsp;States had so far in the history of the country been almost&nbsp;purely a perfunctory one, and has rarely, if ever, led to political&nbsp;promotion. The vice-president is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font0"> president of the&nbsp;Senate, but has little voice or part in shaping either legislation&nbsp;or the affairs of the party. Mr Roosevelt never, however,&nbsp;presided over the deliberations of the Senate, because before&nbsp;the session following his inauguration convened he had ceased&nbsp;to be vice-president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the assassination of McKinley, on the 14th of September 1901, he succeeded to the presidency. No previous president had entered the office at so early an age as&nbsp;forty-three. It was his frankly expressed wish to be nominated&nbsp;and elected president in 1904, and he was nominated unanimously by the Republican National Convention at Chicago,&nbsp;and was elected in November of that year by the largest&nbsp;popular majority ever given to any candidate in any presidential election. He received 7,623,486 popular votes and&nbsp;336 electoral votes to 5,077,971 popular votes and 140 electoral&nbsp;votes cast for Judge Alton B. Parker, the nominee of the&nbsp;Democratic party. Immediately after his election he publicly&nbsp;declared that he would not accept the nomination for the&nbsp;presidency in 1908, and he adhered to that pledge in spite&nbsp;of great popular pressure brought to bear upon him to&nbsp;accept the nomination of the party for another term. The&nbsp;nomination and election of President Taft, who had been&nbsp;a member of Mr Roosevelt's cabinet, was very largely due&nbsp;to the latter's great influence in the party. On March 23rd,&nbsp;two weeks after he ceased to be president, Mr Roosevelt&nbsp;sailed for Africa, to carry out a long-cherished plan of conducting an expedition for the purpose of making a scientific&nbsp;collection of the fauna and flora of the tropical regions of that&nbsp;continent. Expert naturalists accompanied the party, which&nbsp;did not emerge from the wilderness until the middle of the&nbsp;following March, bringing with it a collection which scientists&nbsp;pronounce of unusual value for students of natural history.&nbsp;Most of the specimens were sent to the National Museum of&nbsp;the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. The experiences&nbsp;of his African journey were recorded by Mr Roosevelt in a&nbsp;volume entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">African Game Trails: The Wanderings of an&nbsp;American Hunter Naturalist,</span><span class="font0"> The spring and early Summer&nbsp;of 1910 were spent by Mr Roosevelt in travelling through&nbsp;Egypt, the continent of Europe, and England, in acceptance&nbsp;of invitations which he had received to make various public&nbsp;speeches in these countries. Honorary academic degrees&nbsp;were conferred upon him by the universities of Cairo, Christiania,&nbsp;Berlin, Cambridge and Oxford, and he was given both popular&nbsp;and official ovations of almost royal distinction—ovations which&nbsp;were repeated by his own countrymen on his return to America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be said without exaggeration that no American public man in the history of the country has achieved such&nbsp;extraordinary popularity during his lifetime as Mr Roosevelt&nbsp;had attained at fifty years of age, both at home and abroad.&nbsp;Great popularity necessarily brings with it bitter enmity and&nbsp;genuine criticism. To understand clearly his career as a public&nbsp;man, and to appreciate the forces at work which caused both&nbsp;the popularity and the enmity, two facts must be kept distinctly in mind: first, that at twenty-two years of age he&nbsp;deliberately decided to make politics his life-work at a time&nbsp;when in the United States the word “ politics&quot; had&nbsp;a sinister sound in the ears of almost all of the so-called&nbsp;cultivated classes; and secondly, that in making this deliberate&nbsp;choice he recognized that the government of the United States&nbsp;is primarily a party government. He therefore allied himself&nbsp;with the Republican party, to which by tradition, by family&nbsp;association, and by political principles he was naturally drawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the history of the United States the politician has been too often the man who, in connexion with some other trade&nbsp;or profession, has taken up politics as a tool to carve out&nbsp;some personal ambition or manufacture a financial profit.&nbsp;Mr Roosevelt from the beginning apparently believed with&nbsp;the lexicographers that politics is the science and practice&nbsp;of government. He has himself told the story of an early&nbsp;experience that illustrates his point of view. When in 1881&nbsp;he decided to join the Republican Association of his assembly&nbsp;district in New York City, members of his family were shocked.&nbsp;“ You will find at the meetings, &quot; they said, “ nobody but&nbsp;grooms, liquor dealers and low politicians.&quot; “ Well, ” said&nbsp;Mr Roosevelt in reply, “ if that is so, they belong to the&nbsp;governing class, and you do not. I mean if I can to be one of&nbsp;the governing class. &quot; He forthwith became an active member&nbsp;of the political organization of his district. He also early&nbsp;determined to work with his party as being the only way in&nbsp;which a legislator can work. A free lance, an independent,&nbsp;a journalist, or a preacher, without definite political affiliations,&nbsp;may create public opinion, but a legislator or an administrator&nbsp;must belong to a party. Mr Roosevelt was severely criticized&nbsp;by many “ independent Republicans &quot; for having supported&nbsp;the presidential candidacy of James G. Blaine in 1884, when&nbsp;he had vigorously opposed his nomination in the convention on&nbsp;moral grounds. The reply to this criticism is that Mr Blaine&nbsp;was the choice of the majority of the party, and that while&nbsp;Mr Roosevelt felt free to fight within the party vigorously&nbsp;for reform, he did not feel that the nomination justified a&nbsp;schism like that which occurred in the Democratic party over&nbsp;the free silver issue in 1896—a schism which remained afterwards a hopeless weakness in that party. His position in the&nbsp;Blaine campaign, his attitude in tariff discussions and legislation, his relations with United States senators, congressional&nbsp;representatives, and other party leaders, his methods in making&nbsp;official appointments, were entirely consistent with his constantly reiterated conviction that in politics permanent good&nbsp;is achieved not by guerilla warfare, but by working through&nbsp;and within the party. He was so often accused by political&nbsp;purists for associating politically with men of discredited&nbsp;reputation that his own picturesque statement of his conversion to a belief that in legislative or administrative politics</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
