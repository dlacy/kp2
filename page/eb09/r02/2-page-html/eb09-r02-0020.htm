<p><span class="font0">The Crocodilia have no epiglottis, but the larynx is attached by tendinous fibres to the front part of the shield-like basihyal. The&nbsp;larynx consists of a ring-shaped principal cartilage and arytenoid&nbsp;cartilages. There are folds which serve for vocal cords. The&nbsp;trachea is long, with two short bronchi. The former is generally&nbsp;straight, but may be contorted. The more anterior tracheal&nbsp;cartilages are incomplete dorsally ; those of the hinder part and of&nbsp;the bronchi are generally complete. Each lung consists of pouches&nbsp;or cells, the cavities of which open into each other, and communicate with the cavity of the bronchus by the lateral openings&nbsp;just mentioned. The lungs are enclosed in pouches of peritoneum,&nbsp;and lie, freely suspended, in the body cavity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Vascular System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vascular system of Reptiles consists of a sanguineous and a lymphatic system, and the former is further subdivided into an arterial and a venous system, as in the&nbsp;higher Vertebrates, though the latter two are less completely&nbsp;differentiated. In all there is a heart, which consists of at&nbsp;least three distinct cavities, namely, two auricles (which&nbsp;are almost always distinct) and a ventricle, which latter&nbsp;may or may not be completely subdivided into two distinct chambers, a right and a left ventricle. Reptiles differ&nbsp;from the higher Vertebrates in the heart always giving&nbsp;rise to at least two great vessels, which ultimately join&nbsp;to form a single vessel, and from these all the arteries are&nbsp;given off. Most of the blood of the hind limbs and tail&nbsp;passes either through a portal system in the liver, or else&nbsp;in the kidney, on its road to the heart. That which goes&nbsp;to the liver goes to it for the most part through the anterior&nbsp;abdominal veins or vein. The venous blood is conveyed&nbsp;to the right ventricle through a rhythmically contractile&nbsp;sinus venosus. The lymphatic system is well developed,&nbsp;with large reservoirs, and communicates freely with the&nbsp;venous system by a pair of rhythmically contractile so-called “ lymphatic hearts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Heart and Arterial System.—In all the existing Reptiles except the Crocodilia—that is to say, in the Rhynchocephaliα,&nbsp;Laccrtilia, Oqjhidia, and Chclonia—the two auricles are divided by&nbsp;a complete septum (except in some Chelonians), but the ventricle&nbsp;is only imperfectly divided into aright and left chamber. Of these&nbsp;the latter is the narrower, the more dorsal in position, and mostly&nbsp;has thicker walls, and communicates directly with the left auricle.&nbsp;The right chamber of the ventricle is broader, more ventral, and&nbsp;posterior, and mostly with thinner walls, and communicates&nbsp;directly with the right auricle. No arteries proceed from the left&nbsp;chamber, but three proceed from the right chamber, one of which,&nbsp;the pulmonary artery, goes to the lungs, and the other two constitute the trunk roots of the whole systemic set of arteries or the&nbsp;two aortæ. Between the mouths of their trunk root and that of&nbsp;the pulmonary artery a muscular ridge or valve extends, which&nbsp;imperfectly divides the right chamber of the ventricle into two&nbsp;cavities, which, during the latter part of the ventricle’s contraction, become completely divided by it so as to shut off’ the contained blood from any further access to the pulmonary artery.&nbsp;These great arterial vessels thus leaving the heart are at first&nbsp;closely connected together and are invested with the pericardium,&nbsp;and sometimes, in Chelonians, their investment has been observed&nbsp;to contain striated muscular fibres, thus reminding us of the&nbsp;“ bulbus arteriosus ” of Amphibians. Afterwards the great arteries&nbsp;proceed in diverging and opposite directions, one aorta arching&nbsp;over to the right and the other to the left, and then meeting and&nbsp;uniting on the dorsal side of the heart to form by their junction&nbsp;the single great dorsal aorta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the Lαccrtilia, the Monitors are remarkable for the almost complete septum between their ventricular chambers. In&nbsp;many Lizards the great arteries going to the head may be so connected with the two primitive arterial roots as to form two arches&nbsp;called aortic arches on either side, but in 1he Monitors, Cliamæleons,&nbsp;and Amphisbæna these complications are wanting, there being but&nbsp;a single aortic arch on cither side. Generally the right trunk root,&nbsp;or right fundamental aortic arch, after sup]dying small arteries to&nbsp;the heart itself, gives off’ a common carotid artery, which divides&nbsp;into a right and a left carotid, and these subdivide to supply the&nbsp;head and neck. It also gives off the subclavian arteries for the&nbsp;fore limbs<sup>-</sup>and arteries to the trunk. The left trunk root, or left&nbsp;fundamental aortic arch, gives off arteries to the viscera, and then&nbsp;anastomoses with the right trunk root, the two anastomosing to&nbsp;form the single dorsal aorta, which passes backwards beneath the&nbsp;bodies of the vertebræ, and gives off branches to the'stomach and&nbsp;the viscera, and to the kidneys, sexual glands, hind limbs, and tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Op&gt;hidia the heart is elongated and very distant from the head, and there are of course no limb arteries given off from the&nbsp;aortæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The heart is also distant from the head in the Chelonia, but it is broad in shape and lies above the coracoids. Striated muscular&nbsp;fibres invest the aortic roots in Emys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Crocodilia the ventricle is subdivided by a complete septum into two thoroughly distinct chambers, and a trunk root&nbsp;or fundamental aorta proceeds forth from each,—the left aorta and&nbsp;the pulmonary artery proceeding from the right chamber, and the&nbsp;right aorta from the left ventricle. Nevertheless, though there is&nbsp;here no communication between the chambers whence these two&nbsp;aortæ arise, there is a communication between these two aortæ&nbsp;themselves, and that not only when they anastomose after arching&nbsp;different ways, as in all other Reptiles, but also by a direct communication between them. When they cross one another, as the&nbsp;aorta from the right chamber arches to the left and that from the&nbsp;left chamber arches to the right, a small aperture places their&nbsp;cavities in communication just outside the heart and close to their&nbsp;respective origins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Venous System.—The systemic veins arising in all parts of the body collect together and anastomose till their three finally&nbsp;formed trunks open into a more or less capacious contractile cavity,&nbsp;the sinus venosus, which communicates with the right auricle.&nbsp;The anterior two of these three final trunks are called venæ&nbsp;anonymæ, and the single posterior one is called the vena cava.&nbsp;The former are formed by the gradual junction of the veins of the&nbsp;head, neck, fore limbs, and vertebral region (jugular veins, subclavian azygous veins, &amp;c.), and the vena cava is formed by the&nbsp;junction of the iliac veins or those of the hind limbs, together&nbsp;with the veins of the rest of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The veins of the alimentary canal, spleen, and pancreas, and the abdominal veins (running between the peritoneum and the&nbsp;abdominal muscles) or vein—there being one in the Ophidia—&nbsp;commonly collect and unite to enter the liver to form a portal&nbsp;system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Ophidia the veins of the alimentary canal, generative organs, fatty appendages, pancreas, and spleen thus unite, while&nbsp;the caudal vein with some veins of the generative organs and&nbsp;intestine go to form a subordinate secondary circulation in the&nbsp;kidney or reni-portal system. In the Faeertilia the veins of the&nbsp;hind limbs collect in part to form a reni-portal system, and also&nbsp;communicate with the abdominal veins, which join the ordinary&nbsp;visceral veins to form the true portal system. In the Chelonia&nbsp;the veins of the tail and hind limbs join the abdominal veins&nbsp;above the plastron, and there with others from the bladder and&nbsp;viscera go to form the portal system, while small branches from&nbsp;the abdominal veins join others from the generative organs and&nbsp;vertebral veins to form a reni-portal system. In the Crocodilia&nbsp;the caudal vein divides on entering the trank and joins the&nbsp;posterior limb and body veins, and goes on to form, with the&nbsp;visceral veins, a portal system, giving off in this way veiυs to the&nbsp;kidneys to form the reni-portal system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all Reptiles the veins of the lungs collect together and empty themselves into the left auricle as they do in all other air-breathing&nbsp;Vertebrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lymphatic System and Vascular Glands.—In Reptilia generally there is a pair of lymphatic hearts placed over the&nbsp;transverse processes of the vertebræ at the junction of the tail with&nbsp;the trank. Each usually opens with a small vein which communicates with the iliac vein. Besides these bodies, more or less&nbsp;considerable lymphatic canals follow the course of the great arterial&nbsp;tranks in the body and tail, and, when there are limbs, communicate with the iliac veins. Other canals accompany the aortic&nbsp;arches and approach and open into the venæ anonymæ, and others&nbsp;extend backwards towards these from the head and anterior limbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A pair of bodies which answer to the thymus gland of Mammals lie close to the jugular veins and lymphatics at the anterior part· of&nbsp;the thoracic cavity. They are elongated in Ophidians and roundish&nbsp;in other Reptiles, and they are much larger in young than in old&nbsp;individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A thyroid exists in front of the pericardium on the ventral side of the great arterial trunks. It is bilobed in the Crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The supra-renal capsules are yellowish bodies which lie more in connexion with the generative glands than the kidneys. They are&nbsp;very elongated in the Ophidia, flattened in the Chelonia, and&nbsp;roundish in the Crocodilia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Nervous System and Organs of Sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reptiles, in common with other Vertebrates, have a nervous system divisible into an axial portion or neural&nbsp;axis made up of brain and spinal marrow, and a peripheral portion made up of the multitude of nerves which&nbsp;proceed from or are connected with this, and one portion&nbsp;of which is more or less distinctly separable and known as</span></p>
