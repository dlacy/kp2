There are 12 ſpecies ; the arboreum, canarienſe, glutinoſum, glanduloſum, tectorum, globiſerum, villoſum, tortuoſum, arachnoideum, montanum, ſedeforme, and menanthes. Linnæus has only eight of theſe. The tectorum alone is a native of Britain. The ſtalk is about a foot high ; the radical leaves are thick, oval, pointed, fringed, and ſpreading in a roſe ; thoſe on the item are imbricated and membranous : the flowers are pale red and ſeſſile, and grow on curved terminal bunches. It is frequent on the tops of houfes, and flowers in July.</p><p>The following chemical deſcription of this ſpecies is given by Lewis : “ The leaves of houſe-leek, of no remarkable ſmell, diſcover to the taſte a mild ſubacid auſterſty : their expreſſed juice, of a pale yellowiſh hue when filtered, yields on inſpiſſation a deep yellow, tenacious, mucilaginous maſs, conliderably acidulous and acerb : from whence it may be preſumed, that this herb has ſome claim to the refrigerant and reſtringent virtues that have been aſcribed to it. It is obſervable that the filtered juice, on the addition of an equal quantity of rectified spirit of wine, forms a light white coagulum, like cream of fine pomatum, of a weak but penetrating taſte : this, freed from the fluid part, and expoſed to the air, almoſt totally exhales. From this experiment ſt is concluded by ſome, that houſe-leek contains a volatile alkaline ſalt : but the juice coagulates in the ſame manner with volatile alkalis themſelves, as alſo with fixed alkalis : Acids produce no coagulation.”</p><p>SENAAR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sennaar.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sennaar.</hi></p><p>SENATE, in general, is an aſſembly or council of senators ; that is, of the principal inhabitants of a ſtate, who have a ſhare in the government.</p><p>The ſenate of ancient Rome is of all others the moſt celebrated. It exerciſed no contentious juriſdiction ; but appointed judges, either from among the ſenators or knights, to determine proceſſes : it alſo appointed governors of provinces, and diſpoſed of the revenues of the commonwealth, &amp;c. Yet did not the whole ſovereign power reſide in the ſenate, ſince it could not elect magiſtrates, make laws, or decide of war and peace ; in all which caſes the ſenate was obliged to conſult the people.</p><p>The ſenate, when firſt inſtituted by Romulus, conſiſted of l00 members ; to whom he afterwards added the ſame number when the Sabines had migrated to Rome. Tarquin the ancient made the ſenate conſiſt of 300, and this number remained fixed for a long time ; but afterwards it fluctuated greatly, and was increaſed firſt to 700, and afterwards to 900 by J. Caesar, who filled the ſenate with men of every rank and order. Under Auguſt us the ſenators amounted to 1000, but this number was reduced, and fixed to 600. The place of a ſenator was always beſtowed upon merit: the monarchs had the privilege of chooſing the members ; and after the expulſion of the Tarquſhs, it was one of the rights of the conſuls, till the election of the cenſors, who from their office ſeemed moſt capable of making choice of men whoſe character was irreproachable, whoſe morals were pure, and relations honourable. Only particular families were admitted into the ſenate; and when the plebeians were permitted to ſhare the honours of the ſtate, it was then required that they ſhould be born of free citizens. It was also required that the candidates ſhould be knights</p><p>before their admiſſion into the ſenate. They were to be above the age of 25<hi rend="italic">,</hi> and to have previouſly paſſed through the inferior offices of quaestor, tribune of the people, edile, pretor, and conſul.</p><p>The ſenate always met of courſe on the 1st of January, for the inauguration of the new consuls ; and in all months, univerſally, there were three days, viz. the kalends, nones, and ides, on which it regularly met : but it always met on extraordinary occaſions, when called together by conſul, tribune, or dictator.</p><p>To render their decrees valid and authentic, a certain number of members was requiſite, and ſuch as were abſent without ſome proper cauſe were always fined. In the reign of Auguſtus, 400 ſenators were requiſite to make a ſenate. Nothing was tranſacted before ſun-rise or after ſun-ſet. In their office the ſenators were the guardians of religion, they diſpoſed of the provinces as they pleaſed, they prorogued the aſſemblies of the people, they appointed thankſgivings, nominated their ambaſſadors, diſtributed the public money, and in ſhort had the management of every thing political or civil in the republic, except the creating of magiſtrates, the enacting of laws, and the declarations of war or peace, which were confined to the aſſemblies of the people.</p><p>SENATOR, in general, denotes a member of ſome ſenate.</p><p>The dignity of a Roman ſenator could not be ſupported without the poſſeſſion of 80,000 ſeſterces, or about 7000 l. Engliſh money ; and therefore ſuch as ſquandered away their money, and whoſe fortune was reduced below this ſum, were generally ſtruck out of the list of ſenators. This regulation was not made in the firſt ages of the republic, when the Romans boaſted of their poverty. The ſenators were not permitted to be of any trade or profeſſion. They were diſtinguiſhed from the rest of the people by their dreſs ; they wore the laticlave, half-boots of a black colour, with a creſcent or ſilver buckle in the form of a C ; but this laſt honour was confined only to the deſcendants of thoſe hundred ſenators who had been elected by Romulus, as the letter C ſeems to imply. See the preceding article.</p><p>Among us, ſenator is a member of parliament. In the laws of king Edward the Confeſſor, we are told that the Britons called thoſe <hi rend="italic">ſenators</hi> whom the Saxons called afterwards <hi rend="italic">aldermen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">borough-masters</hi> ; though not for their age, but their wiſdom ; for ſome of them were young men, but very well ſkilled in the laws. Kenulph king of the Mercians granted a charter, which ran thus, viz. <hi rend="italic">Cοnsiliο et conſensu</hi> episcoporum <hi rend="italic">et</hi> ſenatorum <hi rend="italic">gentis ſuae largitus fuit dicto monasterio, &amp;c</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">.</hi></p><p>In Scotland, the lords of ſeſſion are called <hi rend="italic">ſenatort </hi>of the college of juſtice.</p><p>SENATUS A<hi rend="smallcaps">uctoritAS.</hi> See the next article.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Senatus-</hi><hi rend="italic">Conſultum,</hi> which made part of the Roman law. When any public matter was introduced into the ſenate, which was always called <hi rend="italic">referre ad ſenatum,</hi> any ſenator whoſe opinion was aſked, was permitted to ſpeak upon it as long as he pleaſed, and on that account it was often uſual for the ſenators to protract their ſpeeches till it was too late to determine. When the queſtion was put, they paſſed to the side of that ſpeaker whoſe opinion they approved, and a majority of votes was easily collected, without the trouble</p></body></text></TEI>
