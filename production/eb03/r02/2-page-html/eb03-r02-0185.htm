<p><span class="font0">mother’s beauty ; and thereupon took her ſrom her huſ-band, who. commanded in Macedonia : notwithſtanding which, he repudiated her as he had done the former,&nbsp;and likewiſe forbad her future marrying with any other.&nbsp;The wife who caught moſt firmly upon his affections&nbsp;was Milonia Cæfonia, whoſe chief merit lay in her perfect acquaintance with all the alluring arts of her ſex,&nbsp;for ſhe was otherwiſe poſſeſſed neither of youth nor&nbsp;beauty. She continued with him during his reign ;&nbsp;and he loved her ſo ridiculouſly, that he ſometimes&nbsp;ſhowed her to his ſoldiers dreſſed in armour, and ſometimes to his companions ſtark naked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But of all his vices, his prodigality was the moſt remarkable, and that which in ſome meaſure gave riſe to the reſt. The luxuries of former emperors were&nbsp;ſimplicity itſelf, when compared to thoſe which he&nbsp;practiſed. He contrived new ways of bathing, where&nbsp;the richeſt oils and moſt precious perfumes were exhauſted with the utmoſt profuſion. He found out&nbsp;diſhes of immenſe value; and had even jewels, as we&nbsp;are told, diſſolved among his ſauces. He ſometimes&nbsp;had ſervices of pure gold preſented before his gueſts&nbsp;inſtead of meat ; obſerving, that a man ſhould be an&nbsp;ceconomiſt or an emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For ſeveral days together he flung conſiderable ſums of money among the people. He ordered ſhips of a&nbsp;prodigious bulk to be built of cedar, the Items of ivory&nbsp;inlaid with gold and jewels, the fails and tackling of&nbsp;various ſilks, while the decks were planted with the&nbsp;choiceſt fruit tιees, under the ſhade of which he often&nbsp;dined. Here, attended by all the miniſters of his pleaſures, the moſt exquiſite fingers, and the moſt beautiful youths, he coaſted along the ſhore of Campania&nbsp;with great ſplendor. All his buildings ſeemed rather&nbsp;calculated to raiſe aſtoniſhment, than to anſwer the&nbsp;purpoſes of utility. But the moſt notorious inſtance of&nbsp;his fruitleſs profuſion was the vaſt bridge at Puteoli,&nbsp;which he undertook in the third year of his reigu. To&nbsp;ſatisfy his deſire of being maſter as well of the ocean&nbsp;as the land, he cauſed an infinite number of ſhips to be&nbsp;faſtened to each other, ſo as to make a floating bridge&nbsp;from Baiæ to Puteoli, acroſs an arm of the ſea three&nbsp;miles and an half broad. The ſhips being placed in&nbsp;two rows, in form of a creſeent, were ſecured to each&nbsp;other with anchors, chains, and cables. Over theſe&nbsp;were laid vaſt quantities of timber, and upon that earth,&nbsp;ſo as to make the whole reſemble one of the ſtreets of&nbsp;Rome. He next cauſed ſeveral houſes to be built upon his new bridge, for the reception of himſelf and his&nbsp;attendants, into which freſh water was conveyed by&nbsp;pipes from land. He then repaired thither with all his&nbsp;court, attended by prodigious throngs of people, who&nbsp;came from all parts to be ſpectators of ſuch an expenſive pageant. It was there that Caligula, adorned with&nbsp;all the magnificence of eaſtern royalty, ſitting on horſeback with a civic crown and Alexander’s breaſt-plate,&nbsp;attended by the great officers of the army, and all the&nbsp;nobility of Rome, entered at one end of the bridge,&nbsp;and with ridiculous importance rode to the other. At&nbsp;night, the number of torches and other illuminations&nbsp;with which this expenſive ſtructure was adorned, caſt&nbsp;ſuch a gleam as illuminated the whole bay, and all the&nbsp;neighbouring mountains. This - ſeemed to give the&nbsp;weak emperor new cauſe for exultation ; boaſting that&nbsp;he had turned night into day, as well as ſea into land.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">The next morning he again rode over in a triumphant chariot, followed by a numerous train of charioteers,&nbsp;and all his ſoldiers in glittering armour. He then&nbsp;aſcended a roſtrum erected for the occaſion, where he&nbsp;made a ſolemn oration in praiſe of the greatneſs of his&nbsp;enterpriſe, and the aſſiduity of his w<sup>,</sup>orkmen and his&nbsp;army. He then diſtributed rewards among his men,&nbsp;and a ſplendid feaſt ſucceeded. In the midſt of the&nbsp;entertainment many of his attendants were thrown into&nbsp;the ſea ; ſeveral ſhips filled with ſpectators were attacked and ſunk in an hoſtile manner ; and although&nbsp;the majority eſeaped through the calmneſs of the weather, yet many were drowned ; and ſome who endeavoured to ſave themſelves by climbing to the bridge,&nbsp;were ſtruck down again by the emperor’s command.&nbsp;The calmneſs of the ſea during this pageant, which&nbsp;continued ſor two days, furniſhed Caligula with freſh&nbsp;opportunities for boaſting ; being heard to ſay, “ that&nbsp;Neptune took care to keep the ſea ſmooth and ſerene,&nbsp;merely out of reverence to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Expences like theſe, it may be naturally ſuppoſed, muſt have exhauſted the moſt unbounded wealth : in&nbsp;fact, after reigning about a year, Caligula found his revenues totally exhauſted ; and a fortune of about&nbsp;x 8,ooo,ooo of our money, which Tiberius had amaſſed together, entirely ſpent in extravagance and folly.&nbsp;Now, therefore, his prodigality put him upon new&nbsp;methods of ſupplying the exchequer ; and as before his&nbsp;profuſion, ſo now his rapacity became boundleſs. He&nbsp;put in practice all kinds of rapine and extortion ; while&nbsp;his principal ſtudy ſeemed to be the inventing new im-poſts and illicit confiſcations. Every thing was taxed,&nbsp;to the very wages of the meaneſt tradesman. He cauſed freemen to purchaſe their freedom a ſecond time ;&nbsp;and poiſoned many who had named him for their heir,&nbsp;to have the immediate poſſeſſion of their fortunes. He&nbsp;ſet up a brothel in his own palace, by which he gained&nbsp;conſiderable ſums by all the methods of proſtitution.&nbsp;He alſo kept a gaming-houſe, in which he himſelf preſided, lcrupling none of the meaneſt tricks in order to&nbsp;advance his gains. On a certain occaſion having had a&nbsp;run of ill luck, he faw two rich knights paſſing through&nbsp;his court; upon which he ſuddenly roſe up, and cauſing&nbsp;both to be apprehended, conſiſcated their eſtates, and&nbsp;then joining his former companions, boaſted that he&nbsp;never had a better throw in his life. Another time,&nbsp;wanting money for a ſtake, he went down and cauſed&nbsp;ſeveral noblemen to be put to death ; and then returning, told the company that they ſat playing for trifles&nbsp;while he had won 60,000 ſeſterces at a caſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suςh inſupportable and capricious cruelties produced many ſecret conſpiracies againſt him ; but theſe were&nbsp;ſor a while deferred, upon account of his intended expedition againſt the Germans and Britons, which he&nbsp;undertook in the third year of his reign. For this&nbsp;purpoſe, he cauſed numerous levies to be made in all&nbsp;parts of the empire ; and talked with ſo much reſolution, that it was univerſally believed he would conquer&nbsp;all before him. His march perfectly indicated the inequality of his temper : ſometimes it was ſo rapid, that&nbsp;the cohorts were obliged to leave their ſtandards behind them ; at other times it was ſo flow, that it more&nbsp;reſembled a pompous proceſſion than a military expe»&nbsp;dition. In this diſpoſition he would cauſe himſelſ to&nbsp;be carried on eight mens ſhoulders, and order all the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
