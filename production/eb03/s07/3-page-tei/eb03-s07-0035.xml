They ought to be formed of ſuch materials as are ſufficiently firm, while, at the ſame time, they give no uneaſineſs to the parts to which they are applied. They may be compoſed either of linen, cotton, or flannel. Of late years the two laſt have been preferred by many for their warmth and elaſticity, on which account they are certainly moſt proper, eſpecially in winter ; and likewiſe in caſes where the parts are liable to ſwelling and inflammation, as in wounds, luxations, and fractures. Besides, they more readily, abſorb any moiſture which may be diſcharged from the sores.</p><p>When firſt applied, they ſhould be clean, ſufficiently ſtrong, and as free of ſeams as poſſible. They ſhould be ſo tightly applied as to anſwer the purpoſe for which they are intended, without being in danger of impeding the circulation. They ſhould be applied in ſuch a manner that they may be eaſily looſened, and the parts examined with as much accuracy as poſſible ; and they ſhould be laid aſide as ſoon as the purpoſe for which they are intended is accompliſhed ; for when longer continued, they frequently impede the growth of the parts upon which they are applied.</p><p>With reſpect to bandages for particular parts, we ſhall begin with the head, and then proceed to the trunk and extremities. The <hi rend="italic">couvre-chef</hi> of the French, which is a ſquare napkin folded cornerwiſe, is moſt frequently uſed where a bandage is wanted for the head ; but a nightcap, having a band to go round the head, and another to tie under the chin, appears to be more ſuitable for this purpoſe. For making compreſſion on any particular part of the head, as for flopping of bleeding veſſels, the radiated bandage may be employed.</p><p>For keeping the edges of wounds together, as in caſes of longitudinal cuts of the head, or of any other parts, the uniting bandage is uſually employed, and is always to be preferred to futures, where it retains the edges of the wound with sufficient exactneſs. For retaining dreſſings upon the eyes, ſeveral turns of a roller have been uſed, and it is termed <hi rend="italic">monoculus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">binoculus</hi> according to its being applied to one or both eyes ; but the <hi rend="italic">couvre chef,</hi> and the nightcap already mentioned, are leſs apt to slip, and therefore found more convenient for this purpoſe.</p><p>For fractures of the noſe, or wounds there, or on any other part of the face, the uniting bandage anſwers beſt. And in caſes of fracture of the lower jaw, a four-headed roller is moſt convenient : the hole in the centre of the roller receives the chin, and aſſiſts in preventing the bandage from ſhifting. The two upper heads are to be carried backwards ; and being made to paſs each other at the occiput, they are afterwards brought once or twice round the head. The two under heads of the roller being reflected over the chin, are then to be turned upwards and fixed on the upper part of the head.</p><p>The bandages neceſſary for the neck are, the machine already mentioned after the operation of bronchotomy, and one uſed in caſes of wry neck. For every other purpoſe of bandaging a common roller may anſwer perfectly well.</p><p>For fractures of the ſcapula the application of a long roller may be of ſervice.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings upon the thorax the napkin and scapulary are commonly, and very properly uſed ; and when the napkin is employed merely for retaining dreſſings, it need not be longer than to paſs once round the body ; but if it be uſed for making pressure over a fractured rib, it ought to pass two or three times round. For both purpoſes its breadth ought to be six or ſeven inches for an adult.</p><p>The ſame kind of bandages is alſo uſed for making preſſure on the abdomen, as in caſes of umbilical or ventral hernia ; and to keep the bandage properly placed, a ſcapulary is uſed for preventing it from slipping down, and one or two ſtraps connected with it behind, are brought between the thighs, and fixed to it before to prevent it from moving up. A bandage of flannel, and different kinds of belts, are contrived for compreſſing the abdomen in the operation of tap. ping ; and trusses of various conſtructions are uſed for the retention of the protruded bowels in caſes of hernia.</p><p>Bandages of cotton or flannel are uſed for ſupporting the ſcrotum in the various diſeaſes which may occur there, as well as after the operations performed upon it.</p><p>One of the beſt bandages for the penis is a linen or cotton bag, fixed by a roller round the body.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings about the anus, or between that part and the ſcrotum, the T bandage is commonly uſed ; and it is made either with one or two tails, according to the ſituation of the part to which it is to be applied.</p><p>In ſimple fractures, and moſt of the other diſeaſes of the arm, fore-arm, and hand, the roller is the bandage commonly uſed ; but in compound fractures of theſe parts, as well as in the different kinds of fractures of the lower extremities, the 12 or 18 tailed bandage is necessary.</p><p>For longitudinal wounds of the extremities, the uniting bandage is uſed with the ſame advantage as has been already mentioned for wounds of a ſimilar nature upon the head.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVII. <hi rend="italic">The Method of opening a dead Body.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surgeons</hi> are often called, in order to inveſtigate the cauſe and feat of diſeaſes and death, either by the relations of the deceaſed, or the magistrates to whom a repent is to be made ; therefore, at the time of performing this operation, minutes ſhould be taken of what is obſerved. The inſtruments, and all things necessary, ſhould be diſpoſed in order, as for any other operation ; as knives, a razor, a great and ſmall ſaw, ſciſſars ſtraight and curved, elevators, needles threaded, ſponges, tow, ſaw-duſt or bran, baſons with water, towels, and receivers for the viſcera when they are to be taken out of their cavities The body is to be laid upon a ſuitable table, advantageously placed for the light, having a cloth thrown over the parts which decency demands ſhould be concealed, eſpecially in females.</p><p>When it is intended only to inſpect the abdomen and its contents, a longitudinal inciſion from the xiphoid cartilage to the os pubis, interſected by a tranſverſe one at the navel, will give a fair opportunity of anſwering theſe purpoſes, when the angles are reverſed. Should it be required to examine all the three cavities, and the parts contained in them, we are to begin by opening the head, making an inciſion quite croſs to the bone, from ear to ear ; which ſection is preferable to the crucial, commonly made on this occaſion : then the ſcalp may be eaſily dissected from the ſkull, and turned down over the face, and towards the neck, giving room for the ſaw. The head muſt be held very ſteadily by an aſſiſtant during the ſawing, which ſhould be begun on the middle of the frontal, proceeding to each temporal bone, and ſo to finiſh the circle upon the middle of the occipital bone ; which may generally be done conveniently enough, by raiſing the head and inclining it forward after having proceeded as far as this bone ; or the body may then be turned prone, ſhould that poſture be found more convenient to complete the circle. The cap of the ſkull is then to be raised with the elevator, occaſionally cutting the adheſions of the dura mater ; after this the encephalon is to be removed, carefully ſeparating the other attachments of the membrane.</p><p>In order to bring the thorax and abdomen, with the parts</p></body></text></TEI>
