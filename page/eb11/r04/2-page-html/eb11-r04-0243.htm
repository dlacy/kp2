<p><span class="font1">continued to write poems and produce pictures—in the latter relying more and more upon his manipulative skill but exercising&nbsp;less and less his exhaustless faculty of invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1871 an unsigned article in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Review</span><span class="font1"> (by Robert Buchanan) on the ‘‘Fleshly School of Poetry ” made a&nbsp;fierce attack on Rossetti’s poems from what was intended to be&nbsp;a moral point of view, to which he answered by one on the&nbsp;“ Stealthy School of Criticism.” The attack was deeply felt by&nbsp;him, and increased his tendency—previously tempered by natural&nbsp;high spirits—towards gloomy brooding. About 1868 the curse&nbsp;of the artistic and poetic temperament, insomnia, attacked&nbsp;him. One of the most distressing effects of this malady is a&nbsp;nervous shrinking from personal contact with any save a few&nbsp;intimate and constantly seen friends. This peculiar kind of&nbsp;nervousness may be aggravated by the use of narcotics, and in&nbsp;his case was aggravated to a very painful degree; at one time&nbsp;he saw scarcely any one save his own family and immediate&nbsp;family connexions and the present writer. He was frequently&nbsp;away with William Morris at Kelmseot, in Oxfordshire. During&nbsp;the time that his second volume of original poetry, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ballads&nbsp;and Sonnets,</span><span class="font1"> was passing through the press (in 1881) his health&nbsp;began to give way, and he left London for Cumberland. A&nbsp;stay of a few weeks in the Vale of St John, however, did nothing&nbsp;to improve his health, and he returned much shattered. He&nbsp;then went to Birchington-on-Sea, but received no benefit from&nbsp;the change, though affectionately tended by friends like Hall&nbsp;Caine and others already mentioned; and, gradually sinking&nbsp;from a complication of disorders, he died on Sunday the 9th&nbsp;of April 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all matters of taste Rossetti’s influence has been immense. The purely decorative arts (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arts and Crafts)</span><span class="font1"> he may be&nbsp;said to have rejuvenated directly or indirectly. And he left&nbsp;the deepest impression upon the poetic methods of his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the most wonderful of Rossetti’s endowments, however, was neither of a literary nor an artistic kind: it was that of a rare and most winning personality which attracted towards&nbsp;itself, as if by an unconscious magnetism, the love of all his&nbsp;friends, the love, indeed, of all who knew him.

<p><span class="font1">ROSSI, LUIGI DE, a 17th-century Italian musical composer, said to have been born at Naples towards the close of the 16th&nbsp;century. Of his life practically nothing is known. An opera&nbsp;•of his, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Il Palazzo Incantato,</span><span class="font1"> was given at Rome in 1642; in&nbsp;1646 he was invited by Cardinal Mazarin to Paris, where he&nbsp;gave his opera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Mariage d'Orphee et d’Euridice</span><span class="font1"> (1647), the&nbsp;first Italian opera performed in Paris. A collection of cantatas&nbsp;published in 1646 describes him as musician to Cardinal Antonio&nbsp;Berberini, and G. A. Perti in 1688 speaks of him along with&nbsp;Carissimi and Cesti as “ the three greatest lights of our profession.” Rossi is noteworthy principally for his chamber-cantatas, which are among the finest that the 17th century&nbsp;produced. A large quantity are in MS. in the British Museum&nbsp;and in Christ Church library, Oxford. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Gelosia,</span><span class="font1"> printed&nbsp;by F.A. Gevaert in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Gloires d'Italie,</span><span class="font1"> is an admirable specimen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSSI, PELLEGRINO LUIGI EDOARDO, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count</span><span class="font1"> (1787-1848), Italian economist and statesman, was bom at Carrara on the&nbsp;13th of July 1787. He was educated at Pavia and Bologna,&nbsp;.and in 1812 became professor of law at the latter university.&nbsp;In 1815 he gave his support to Joachim Murat, and after his&nbsp;fall escaped to France, whence he proceeded to Geneva. There&nbsp;he began a course of jurisprudence applied to Roman law, the&nbsp;success of which gained him the unusual honour of naturalization as a citizen of Geneva. In 1820 he was elected as a&nbsp;deputy to the cantonal council, and was a member of the extraordinary diet of 1832. He was entrusted with the task of&nbsp;drawing up a revised constitution, which was known as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pacte Rossi.</span><span class="font1"> This was rejected by a majority of the diet, a&nbsp;result which deeply affected Rossi, and induced him to look&nbsp;with favour on the suggestions of Guizot and the duc de Broglie&nbsp;that he should settle in France. He was appointed in 1833 to&nbsp;the chair of political economy in the Collège de France, vacated&nbsp;by the death of J. B. Say. He was naturalized as a French&nbsp;citizen in 1834, and in the same year became professor of&nbsp;constitutional law in the faculty of law at Paris. In 1836 he&nbsp;was elected a member of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Académie des sciences politiques&nbsp;et morales,</span><span class="font1"> was raised to the peerage in 1839 and in 1843 became&nbsp;doyen of the faculty of law. In 1845 he was sent to Rome by&nbsp;Guizot to discuss the question of the Jesuits, being finally&nbsp;appointed ambassador of France at Rome. The revolution&nbsp;of 1848 severed his connexion with France, and he remained&nbsp;at Rome and became minister of the interior under Pius IX.&nbsp;He was unpopular, however, owing to his conservative views,&nbsp;and was assassinated on the 15th of November, as he was&nbsp;alighting at the steps of the House of Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a statesman,. Rossi was a man of signal ability and intrepid character, but it. is as an economist that fiis name will be best&nbsp;remembered. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cours d'économie politique</span><span class="font1"> (1838-54) gave in&nbsp;classic form an exposition of the doctrines of Say, Malthus and&nbsp;Ricardo. His other works were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traité de droit pénal</span><span class="font1"> (1829); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cours&nbsp;de droit constitutionnel</span><span class="font1"> (1866-67), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mélanges a<sup>1</sup>économie politique,&nbsp;d'histoire et de philosophie</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols., 1857). His widow left a sum of&nbsp;100,000 francs to the Institut de France, to found in his memory&nbsp;scholarships in political economy or law. Carrara erected a statue&nbsp;to his memory in 1876, and in 1887 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Société d'économie politique&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">celebrated his centenary with a notice of his life and works.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSSINI, GIOACHINO ANTONIO (1792-1868), Italian musical composer, was bom at Pesaro on the 29th of February 1792.&nbsp;His father was town trumpeter and inspector of slaughterhouses, his mother a baker’s daughter. The elder Rossini’s&nbsp;sympathies for the French became a source of trouble when,&nbsp;after the occupation of the papal state by the French in 1796,&nbsp;the Austrians restored the old regime. He was sent to prison,&nbsp;and his wife took Gioachino to Bologna, earning her living&nbsp;as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prima donna buffa</span><span class="font1"> at various theatres of the Romagna,&nbsp;where she was ultimately rejoined by her husband. Gioachino&nbsp;remained-at Bologna in the care of a pork butcher, while his&nbsp;father played the horn in the bands of the theatres at which&nbsp;his mother sang. The boy had three years’ instruction in the&nbsp;harpsichord from Prinetti of Novara, but Prinetti played the&nbsp;scale with two fingers only, combined his profession of a musician&nbsp;with the business of selling liquor, and fell asleep while he&nbsp;stood, so that he was a fit subject for ridicule with his critical&nbsp;pupil. Gioachino was taken from him and apprenticed to a&nbsp;smith. In Angelo Tesei he found a congenial master, and&nbsp;learned to read at sight, to play accompaniments on the pianoforte, and to sing well enough to take solo parts in the church&nbsp;when he was ten years of age. At thirteen he appeared at&nbsp;the theatre of the Commune in Paër’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camilla—</span><span class="font1"> his only appearance as a public singer (1805). He was also able to play the&nbsp;horn. In 1807 he was admitted to the counterpoint class of&nbsp;Padre P. S. Mattei, and soon after to that of Cavedagni for&nbsp;the ’cello at the Conservatorio of Bologna. He learned to&nbsp;play the ’cello with ease, but the pedantic severity of Mattei’s&nbsp;views on counterpoint only served to accentuate the tendency&nbsp;of his genius towards a freer school of composition, and his&nbsp;insight into orchestral resources is to be ascribed rather to&nbsp;knowledge gained by scoring the quartets and symphonies of&nbsp;Haydn and Mozart, than to any prescribed rules for the composition of music. At Bologna he was known as “ il Tedes-chino ” on account of his devotion to Mozart. Through the&nbsp;friendly interposition of the Marquis Cavalli, his first opera,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Cambiale di Malrimonio,</span><span class="font1"> was produced at Venice when he&nbsp;was a youth of eighteen. But two years before this he had&nbsp;already received the prize at the Conservatorio of Bologna</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
