<p><span class="font2">in size and being more closely set together. For the commoner kinds of ropes, however, hackling through the coarsest board&nbsp;is found to be sufficient, while in most other cases two hacklings&nbsp;are adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hackler takes up a handful or “streak” @@<sup>1</sup> of hemp from the bundle, wraps one end firmly round his hand, and with his&nbsp;fingers distributes a little oil over the hemp. The oil softens&nbsp;the material, keeps the hackle pins in good condition, and&nbsp;facilitates generally the splitting up of the fibre as the streak&nbsp;is drawn through the pins. In the first place, only the'ends&nbsp;of the streak are hackled; they are dashed into the pins and&nbsp;drawn through them in order to separate the fibres and to&nbsp;lay them parallel; but as the operation proceeds a gradually&nbsp;increasing length of the streak is thrown on and drawn through&nbsp;the pins. The process is indeed very similar to the combing&nbsp;out of a head of human hair. When half the length of the&nbsp;streak is thoroughly combed, the other half is treated in precisely the same manner. The hackled streak is then weighed,&nbsp;doubled up to prevent any entanglement, and laid aside for&nbsp;the process of spinning. During the hackling process a large&nbsp;quantity of comparatively short fibres are retained in the&nbsp;pins; the longest of these are separated, and the remainder&nbsp;used for tow yams. The above description refers entirely to&nbsp;hand hackling; machine hackling of hemp is very similar to&nbsp;flax hackling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The spinning is done in what is, termed the “ rope-walk,” and from the nature of hand-spinning, and the length of the&nbsp;rope required, it is necessary that this walk should be from&nbsp;300 to 400 yds. in length. It is sometimes completely covered&nbsp;in with walls and roof; at other times only a roof is built;&nbsp;while in exceptional cases the whole of the walk, with the&nbsp;exception of a small hut at each end, is without shelter of any&nbsp;kind. The operation of spinning is very important, as the&nbsp;weight of the yarn and the appearance of the finished product&nbsp;depend upon it. A description of spinning and laying as performed by the aid of the hand-wheel will perhaps be the best&nbsp;means of giving an idea of this useful branch of manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The front and end elevations of one variety of spinning-wheel are shown in figs. 1 and 2. The apparatus is fixed to some convenient&nbsp;part of the building, or to special supports. The wheel A, which is&nbsp;turned by hand, and always in the same direction, communicates&nbsp;motion to the rotating hooks or “ whirls ” B, C, D and E by means&nbsp;of a listing band or strap F. The arrangement of the listing shows&nbsp;clearly that the hook E will revolve in the opposite direction to&nbsp;hooks B, C, and D. The spinner takes two streaks of the hackled&nbsp;hemp, wraps them round his waist with the ends at his back, and&nbsp;keeps the fibre in position by adjusting his apron partly round it.&nbsp;From the middle of the streak—that is, midway between the two ends&nbsp;—he takes hold of a quantity of fibre and hangs it on to one of the&nbsp;hooks B, C or D ; the assistant at the wheel begins to turn, and thus&nbsp;a certain amount of twist is imparted to the material between the&nbsp;spinner and the hook. The spinner now walks backwards down the&nbsp;walk, drawing out the fibre with his left hand and adjusting it with&nbsp;his right. A piece of flannel or woollen cloth held in his right hand&nbsp;aids in the formation of the thread and protects his fingers from the&nbsp;rough fibre. In some cases two threads are spun simultaneously;&nbsp;when this is done, two of the hooks, say B and C, are used at the same&nbsp;time. Since the revolutions of the hook divided by the length of&nbsp;yarn spun give the amount of twist per inch or foot, it follows that&nbsp;the ratio of the walking pace of the spinner to the revolutions of the&nbsp;wheel A should be constant, otherwise the yarn will not be uniform.&nbsp;The spinner calls to the assistant when there is any irregularity in&nbsp;speed, or when, from any cause, he is obliged to stop walking.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1</sup> See note in the article on </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jute</span><span class="font2"> for variations of spelling.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">At convenient intervals in the length of the walk, and projecting from posts, are short horizontal bars; the top of each bar is provided&nbsp;with wires or pegs to form a number of vertical partitions something&nbsp;like a very coarse comb. As the spinner proceeds down the walk,&nbsp;he throws the spun yarn into one of these partitions, thus relieving&nbsp;himself of the weight and keeping the yarn off the ground. When a&nbsp;sufficient length of yarn has been spun, he breaks off the fibres and&nbsp;fastens the yarn to a convenient peg or hook until he has spun a&nbsp;sufficient number (usually three) to form a small rope or cord. The&nbsp;person at the wheel hangs these three yarns one on each of the three&nbsp;hooks B, G and D, while the spinner attaches the other ends to a&nbsp;revolving hook termed a “ looper.” All is now ready for “ laying ”&nbsp;the yarns. For small cords, this may be done, with or without a&nbsp;“ top.” This top is a conical-shaped piece of hard wood provided&nbsp;with three equidistant grooves which merge towards each other at&nbsp;the thin end, and into which the yarns arc laid. The thick end of the&nbsp;top is nearest the wheel, so that the yarns may be kept separate on&nbsp;that side. As the hooks twist the three threads, the spinner goes up&nbsp;the walk with the top; the twist in the yarns causes the looping&nbsp;hook to revolve in the opposite direction to the other hooks, and thus&nbsp;it twists the three threads in the opposite direction to the original&nbsp;twist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fig. 3 shows one form of top, the three yarns being shown in distinctive marks so that the path of each may be more easily&nbsp;followed by the reader ; a plan of the thick end of the top appears to&nbsp;the left of the figure. If four yarns of strands are required, the top&nbsp;would contain four grooves, as well as a hole .through the centre to&nbsp;admit of a core when such a thing is required. As soon as the&nbsp;spinner, who carries the top, arrives at the wheel, the assistant takes&nbsp;the yarns off hooks B, C and D (figs. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">and 2), and puts them all on&nbsp;hook E. The other ends of the strands are removed from the looper&nbsp;and attached to a block of wood called a “ drag.” The wheel is then&nbsp;rotated as before, which puts more twist into the cord. While&nbsp;this operation, which is termed hardening, proceeds, a shrinkage in&nbsp;the length of the cord takes place, and the drag is consequently&nbsp;drawn up the walk. The drag, however, holds the cord taut, and&nbsp;serves to retain the twist which is imparted by the hook E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the strands require tarring before they are laid, they are separately taken off the hooks, after they have been spun, and tied&nbsp;at both ends to pegs to keep them taut until a sufficient number has&nbsp;collected to be conveniently handled at the tarring tank. The tar&nbsp;is heated to about 220° F., and the strands are then passed through&nbsp;it at a speed not greater than 15 ft. per minute. Before emerging&nbsp;from the tank, the strands pass between squeezing rollers which&nbsp;remove all superfluous tar. In a short time the strands are dry,&nbsp;while in the space of a few days the tar is hard enough to allow the&nbsp;strands to be formed into ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such is, in general, the hand process of forming ropes when they are composed of only three or four single yarns. It very often happens,&nbsp;however, that a number of single yarns are required to form each&nbsp;strand of the rope. The single yarns may be spun by hand, as&nbsp;described above, or by machinery. In the former case a group of&nbsp;yarns is usually termed a “ haul,” while the machine-spun yarns&nbsp;are formed into what is known as a “ warp ” or “ chain?’ In any&nbsp;case, the group of yarns is stretched down the rope-walk, at each&nbsp;end of which is a “ jack ” twister. A few of the yarns taken from&nbsp;the group—the number depending upon the size of the yarn and&nbsp;also upon the required diameter of the strand—are then placed on&nbsp;a hook of the jack twister and twisted together. .When three such&nbsp;strands are made they are laid into a rope in a similar manner to&nbsp;that explained above. A simple form of hand jack twister is&nbsp;illustrated in figs. 4 and 5. The wheel A gears with pinions B on the&nbsp;shafts of the hooks or whirls, and this imparts the necessary motion&nbsp;to the latter. At the other end of the walk is a similar machine&nbsp;which moves upon rails as the twist is put into the strands. When&nbsp;the hooks are empty, pinions B and wheel A (fig. 4) are out of gear,&nbsp;but those hooks carrying yarn are drawn out, as shown at C, until&nbsp;the pinion B gears with wheel A, when the hooks are rotated.
