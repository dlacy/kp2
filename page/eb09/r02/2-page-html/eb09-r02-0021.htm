<p><span class="font1">the sympathetic system. Reptiles also generally possess three distinct organs of sense—(1) ears, (2) eyes, and (3)&nbsp;nasal organs—though one or more of them may be exceptionally rudimentary and defective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Neural Axis.—</span><span class="font1">The spinal marrow extends through nearly the whole length of the neural canal of the skeleton&nbsp;in the form of a long nervous cylinder with a small central&nbsp;cavity, with a deep furrow along the middle of its dorsal&nbsp;and a shallow one on the middle of its ventral aspect. It&nbsp;becomes more or less augmented in volume about the&nbsp;region of the shoulders and loins, where the nerves of the&nbsp;limbs are given off from it. Even where most enlarged,&nbsp;however, the tracts on either side of the dorsal furrow do&nbsp;not diverge and leave a space or sinus as they do in the&nbsp;lumbar enlargement of Birds. Where the spinal marrow&nbsp;comes to join the brain it enlarges considerably. At the&nbsp;medulla oblongata it is bent down at a marked angle with&nbsp;the more posterior part of the neural axis. The two&nbsp;halves of its dorsal portion also diverge so as to expose&nbsp;the dorsal surface of the more ventral portion in a space&nbsp;which is known as the fourth ventricle or ventricle of the&nbsp;medulla. This medulla advances forward, expanding and&nbsp;becoming locally differentiated to form the brain, its&nbsp;ventricle being continued on into a more anterior and&nbsp;more completely enclosed cavity known as the third ventricle. The nervous roof of the hinder part of this latter&nbsp;ventricle is produced into two smooth prominences placed&nbsp;side by side and called the optic globes or corpora bigemina&nbsp;(which may themselves contain a cavity), immediately&nbsp;behind which is an azygous nervous structure, the cerebellum, which more or less roofs over the hindmost or fourth&nbsp;ventricle. In front of the optic lobes are the larger rounded&nbsp;smooth neural masses—the cerebral hemispheres, each of&nbsp;which contains a cavity—the lateral or first and second&nbsp;ventricles, which both communicate with the anterior end&nbsp;of the third ventricle through an aperture termed the&nbsp;foramen of Munro. Between the hinder ends of these&nbsp;hemispheres an azygous structure projects upwards—the&nbsp;pineal gland—while from beneath the floor of the third&nbsp;ventricle another azygous structure projects downwards—&nbsp;the pituitary body. In front of the hemispheres are the&nbsp;other rounded and smaller neural masses, the olfactory&nbsp;lobes, which are generally elongated and contain cavities&nbsp;that are continuations forwards of the lateral ventricles.&nbsp;Three transverse bands of nervous tissue connect the structures which bound</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">band is called the soft commissure ; and the third, a little farther back still, is the posterior commissure. The masses&nbsp;joined by those last two commissures are called the optic&nbsp;thalami. The brain is invested with membranes in the&nbsp;same general way as it is in Mammals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Larertilia the cerebellum is a thin very small body projecting rather upwards, and may be transversely segmented,&nbsp;as in Platydactylus. In the Chamæleons the optic lobes and&nbsp;hemispheres are of nearly equal size, and the olfactory lobes are&nbsp;neither separated off nor hollow. In the Ophidia the cerebellum&nbsp;nearly covers the fourth ventricle, the hemispheres are of considerable size, and the olfactory lobes may be immediately annexed to&nbsp;them. In the Chelonia the cerebellum is rather large, but it is&nbsp;only in the Crocodilia that it is marked by transverse grooves, as&nbsp;is the central part of the cerebellum or dermis in Mammals ; the&nbsp;hemispheres also are of considerable volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some extinct Reptilia, e.g., in the Dinosaurian Stegosαιmιs, the brain was exceedingly small, probably weighing but the&nbsp;hundredth part of that of the Alligator compared with the weight&nbsp;of the bodies of the two animals. Moreover, the cerebral hemispheres but little exceeded the optic lobes in size, while the transverse&nbsp;diameter of these lobes only slightly exceeded that of the medulla.&nbsp;The cerebellum also was very small. In the Omithosauria, however, the optic lobes were unlike in their situation those of any&nbsp;existing Reptiles, they being depressed and placed laterally instead&nbsp;of on the dorsum of the brain, thus resembling the optic lobes of&nbsp;Birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peripheral System.—</span><span class="font1">As in the higher Mammals, so also in Reptiles, the neural axis gives off a series of special&nbsp;nerves, which in a general way correspond in number with&nbsp;the vertebræ they pass out between. Each also arises by&nbsp;a superior and inferior root, whereof the former is furnished&nbsp;with a ganglion. After the junction of these two roots&nbsp;the whole nerve thus formed divides into ascending and&nbsp;descending branches—the latter, in the trunk, running&nbsp;between the internal oblique and transverse muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cranial nerve which comes forth from the brain nearest the spinal marrow is the hypoglossal. It passes out through a condyloid foramen in the occipital bone, and goes to the tongue, hyoid,&nbsp;and larynx. A more anteriorly placed nerve, called the spinal&nbsp;accessory, exists except in Ophidia. It arises between the superior&nbsp;and inferior roots of the more anterior spinal nerves, and then&nbsp;enters the cranium, which it leaves again in company with that&nbsp;next to be noted. It supplies certain dorsal muscles of the neck&nbsp;or anterior part of the trunk. The next or pneumogastric nerve&nbsp;passes out into the spinal accessory. It is distributed to the lungs,&nbsp;stomach, and heart. To these, next in advance, succeeds the glossopharyngeal for the tongue and pharynx. Very distinct from the&nbsp;foregoing is the facial nerve, which passes out at a distinct foramen&nbsp;and turns rather backwards to supply the sides of the head. Next&nbsp;is to be distinguished the acoustic nerve, which goes to the internal&nbsp;ear, and in front of that again is the trigeminal, which is wont to&nbsp;make its exit at two distinct places, and diverges into three branches,&nbsp;which go respectively to the orbit, the upper jaw, and the lower jaw.&nbsp;Then come three small nerves destined to supply the muscles which&nbsp;move the eyeball; and foremost but one is the optic nerve; this&nbsp;crossing its fellow of the opposite side beneath the brain, the fibres&nbsp;of the tw’o nerves blend at their point of intersection and so form&nbsp;what is called the chiasma. Most anterior of all are the olfactory&nbsp;nerves, which proceed from the olfactory lobes to the nasal organs&nbsp;themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Chelοnia the spinal accessory may take origin as far back as the root of the fourth cervical nerve. The pneumogastric&nbsp;and glosso-pharyngeal pass out from the skull separately as in&nbsp;Saurians, and not through one foramen as in Ophidians and&nbsp;Crocodilians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those spinal nerves which continue to supply the limbs form certain more or less complex unions with each other termed&nbsp;plexuses, and from each plexus the nerves of the fore or hind limbs,&nbsp;as the case may be, proceed. The plexus which supplies the nerves&nbsp;of the fore limb is called the brachial plexus. It is formed by the&nbsp;hlendingof about the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth spinal nerves&nbsp;in the Turtle and Crocodile, and the nerves it gives forth are the&nbsp;axillary, ulnar, radial, musculo-spiral. and median as in Mammals.&nbsp;Certain of the more posterior nerves unite to form a crural plexus&nbsp;and others just behind the former blend to form a sacral plexus,&nbsp;and from these the nerves of the leg and pelvic region proceed.&nbsp;Amongst these nerves are the crural, obturator, and especially tlιe&nbsp;great sciatic nerve, which passes to the back of the thigh and&nbsp;divides into the tibial nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As to the particular spinal nerves which go to form these plexuses respectively, and as to the mode of their interlacement and&nbsp;mode of giving origin to the limb nerves, there is not only diversity&nbsp;between different genera of the same order and species of the same&nbsp;genus, but also between different individuals of the same genus,&nbsp;and even between the two sides of the same individual Reptile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Sympathetic Nervous System—nerves which copiously supply the viscera—is least marked in the Ophidia, in which&nbsp;this system is not distinct, in the greater part of the body,&nbsp;from the spinal nerves. Essentially the system consists of two&nbsp;antero-posteriorly extending nervous cords, which run on either&nbsp;side of the axial skeleton in its ventral aspect. Each of these two&nbsp;cords is joined by fibres from the spinal and cranial nerves adjacent&nbsp;to it except the nerves of the nose, eye, and ear. At the points of</span></p>
