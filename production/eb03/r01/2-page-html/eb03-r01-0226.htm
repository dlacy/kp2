<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">cſ Betignies, </span><span class="font1">now advanced with fnch ſtrength upon ’ Charleroi in the eaſt that its immediate ſali was fear-ed. As this would have enabled the two French ar-mies to encircle the whole of Flanders, the prince of&nbsp;Cobourg advanced to its relief. Charleroi furrendered&nbsp;at diſcretion on the 25th. This circumſtance was not&nbsp;known by the prince of Cobourg when he advanced on&nbsp;the 26th to. attack in their entrenchments the army that&nbsp;covered the ſiege near Fleürus : but the covering army&nbsp;being by this time reinforced by the acceffion of the&nbsp;beſieging army, the aliies were repulſed. Jourdan then&nbsp;drew llis men out of their entrenchments ; and, in his&nbsp;turn, attacked the Auſtrians. Fie was three times re-pulſed, but was at laſt ſucceſaſul : the hffs of the van·&nbsp;quiſhed army is ſaid to have been prodigious ; but no&nbsp;regular accounts of it have been publiſhed. The French&nbsp;unqueſtionably exaggerated their own ſucceſs, when&nbsp;they ſaid that it amounted to 15,000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The allies now retreated in ali quarters. Nieuport, Oſtend, and Bruges, were taken ; and Tournay, Mons,&nbsp;Oudenarde, and Bruſſels, opened their gates. At this&nbsp;.laſt place tlie French armies of Eaſt and weſt Flan-ders united. Landrecies, Valenciennes, Condé, and&nbsp;Queſnoy, were fruitleisly left with garriſons in them.&nbsp;The allied troops, evacuating Namur, formed a line&nbsp;from Antwerp to Liege to protect the country behind.&nbsp;The French advanced in full force, and attacked ge-neral Clairfait, cut to pieces half the troops that&nbsp;now remained under him, and broke the line. The ah&nbsp;lies retreated before them. The dtike of York was joined'&nbsp;by ſome troops under the earl of Moira that with much ,&nbsp;difficulty had made their way to him from Oſtend ; and&nbsp;with thefe and the Dutch troops he retired to the&nbsp;neighbourhood of Bergen-op-zoom and- Breda for the&nbsp;protection of Holland. The prince of Cobourg eva-cuated Liege, croſſed the Mæfe, and placed a garri-ſon in Maeſtricht. He ſoon, however, ſent back a part&nbsp;of his troops to the neighbourhood of Tongres ; for&nbsp;here, to the aſtoniſhment of all Europe, the French&nbsp;armies made a voluntary pauſe in their career of vic-tory, and ceaſed to purſue their retiring foes. Sluys&nbsp;in Dutch Flanders was the only foreign poſt that they&nbsp;continued to attack, and it ſurrendered </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">after a </span><span class="font1">ſiege of&nbsp;21 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the Rhine the war was equally ſuccefsful on the part bf the French. On the lzth, 13th, and 14th of&nbsp;July, repeated engagements were fought ; in which the&nbsp;French enjoyed their uſual ſucceſs. They had nume-rous armies in every quarter.. Their mode of fighting&nbsp;was to make full preparation for aecompliſhing their&nbsp;object, and to fight in great bodiea day after day till it&nbsp;was obtained. The Palatinate was thus over-run, and&nbsp;Treves taken, by general Michaud. Flanders and the&nbsp;Palatinate have always been accounted the. granaries of&nbsp;Germany ; and both of them, at the commencement of&nbsp;the harveſt, now fell into the hands of the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the courſe of this ſummer Corſica was ſub-dued by Great Britain and the whole of the French weſt India Iſſands, excepting a part of Gaadaulope,&nbsp;yielded to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">Britiſh troops under the command oſ Sir&nbsp;Charles Grey and Sir John Jarvis. On </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">firſt oſ June&nbsp;the Britiſh fleet, under the command oſ earl Howe,&nbsp;gained a moſt ſplendid victory over the French fleet to&nbsp;the weſtward of Uſhant. The French committee of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſaſety were known to have puchaſed in America im</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">menſe quantities of grain and other ſtores. Thefe were embarked on board 160 fail of merchantmen, convoyed&nbsp;by ſix ſail oſ the line.. Lord Howe failed to intercept&nbsp;this valuable convoy. The French fleet failed at the&nbsp;fame time to protect it... On the morning oſ the 28th&nbsp;oſ May the fleets came in ſight of each other. The&nbsp;Britiſh admiral had previouſſy diſpatched ſſx ſhips of&nbsp;the line under admiral Montague to intercept the&nbsp;French convoy, while he ſhould engage and detain the&nbsp;grand fleet, 'ſ'he French diſpatched eight, ſail to defeat this attempt.. In the courſe oſ the 29th Lord&nbsp;Howe got to windward of the French fleet. His&nbsp;force was 25, and theirs was 2-6, ſail oſ the line. The&nbsp;following day he bore dôwn upon them, and broke&nbsp;their line. Tlie engagement was one oſ the ſevereſt'&nbsp;ever fought., Tlie French admiral, in leſs than an hour&nbsp;aſter the cloſe action commenced in the centre, crouded&nbsp;off with 12 oſ his ſhips.. The Britiſh fleet was ſo much&nbsp;diſabled, or ſeparated, that ſeveral oſ the French diſ-rnantled ſhips got away under fails raiſed on the ſtump,&nbsp;oſ their ſore-maſts. Seven ſail oſ the line, however, re-mained in poſſeffion· oſ the Britiſh, and two were un-queſtionably ſunk.. In the mean time, admiral Mon-.&nbsp;tague ſell in with the French convoy, but it- was now&nbsp;guarded by 14 ſail oſ the line. Äs he could not encounter ſuch a force, he returned home, and it was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſafe»-</span><span class="font1">ly conveyed into port; Thus, by one oſ thoſc contradictions which ſo often occur in human affairs, the Britiſh fleet was victorious, and the French were leſt in&nbsp;ſome meaſure mailers oſ the ſea. As this engagement&nbsp;however teſtiſied that tlre Britiſh ſeamen had not loſt,&nbsp;their ancient ſuperiority on their own element, the&nbsp;nation regarded the preſent victory as a pledge oſ its&nbsp;independence, and very general rejoicings took place&nbsp;in conſequence of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the revolutionary ſyſtem of go-vernment in the hands of committees of the convention at Paris, and. of committees of the- popular ſocieties&nbsp;throughout the country, was arrived at its higheſt perfection, and proceeded without oppoſition in its ſevere&nbsp;and ſanguinary meaſures-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On .the 10th of May Madame Elizabeth, ſiſter of thc late king, was ſacriſiced by it in conſequence of a decree&nbsp;of the revolutionary tribunal. Multitudes of others of&nbsp;every rank and ſex were daily ſacrificed in a ſimſſar&nbsp;manner; the rich in particular were the great, objects&nbsp;of perſecution, becauſe the confifcation of their property added to the ſtrength of the ruling powers. But&nbsp;neither were the poor ſafe from the bloody vigilance of&nbsp;this new and ſingular government. By the different&nbsp;executions Robefpierre had contrived to deſtroy every&nbsp;avowed rival. All the conſtituted authorities conſiſted&nbsp;wholly of perſons nominated with his approbation ; and&nbsp;as the committees which conducted the buſineſs of the&nbsp;ſtate were at his diſpoſal, his will was irreſiſtible throughout the republic. He met witli no oppoſition in th’e&nbsp;conventien ; ſor that body was no longer the turbulent&nbsp;popular aſſembly which it had once appeared ; it was&nbsp;little more than a name employed to give ſome fort of&nbsp;reſpectability to ſuch ſchemes as were propoſed to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Amidſt this accumulation, however, of ſecmingly ir-reſiſtible authority, Robefpierre was at the brink of ruin. The whole of the old Girondiſt party was indeed&nbsp;ſubdued and ſilent ; but many members of the conven</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tion ſtill remained attached to it.
