See <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> Sect. iv. p. 434.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Style,</hi> in language, is the peculiar manner in which a man expreſſes his conceptions. It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the order in which they are there produced.</p><p>The qualities of a good ſtyle may be ranked under two heads ; perspicuity and ornament. It will readily be admitted, that perſpicuity ought to be eſſentially connected with every kind of writing ; and to attain it, attention muſt be paid, firſt to single words and phraſes, and then to the conſtruction of ſentences. When conſidered with reſpect to words and phraſes, it requires theſe three qualities ; purity, propriety, and preciſion. When conſidered with regard to ſentences, it requires a clear arrangement of the words and unity in the ſenſe ; to which, if ſtrength and harmony be added, the ſtyle will become ornamented.</p><p>One of the moſt important directions to be obſerved by him who wiſhes to form a good ſtyle, is to acquire clear and preciſe ideas on the ſubject concerning which he is to write or ſpeak. To this muſt be added frequency of compoſition, and an acquaintance with the ſtyle of the beſt authors. A ſervile imitation, however, of any author is carefully to be avoided ; for he who copies, can hardly avoid copying faults as well as beauties. A ſtyle cannot be proper unleſs it be adapted to the ſubject, and likewiſe to the capacity of our hearers, it we are to ſpeak in public. A ſimple, clear, and unadorned ſtyle, ſuch as that of Swift, is fitteſt for intricate diſquiſition ; a ſtyle elegant as Addiſon’s, or impetuous like Johnson's, is moſt proper for fixing the attention on truths, which, though known, are too much neglected. We muſt not be inattentive to the ornaments of ſtyle, if we wiſh that our labours ſhould be read and admired : but he is a contemptible writer, who looks not beyond the dress of language, who lays not the chief ſtreſs upon his matter, and who does not regard ornament as a ſecondary and inferior recommendation.
