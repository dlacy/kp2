<p><span class="font0">enemies and suspect his friends. His moral character was undoubtedly weak in other ways than this, but it is fair to&nbsp;remember that but for his astounding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font0"> the more&nbsp;disgusting parts of it would not have been known, and that&nbsp;these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font0"> were written, if not under hallucination, at&nbsp;any rate in circumstances entitling the self-condemned criminal&nbsp;to the benefit of considerable doubt. If Rousseau had held&nbsp;his tongue, he might have stood lower as a man of letters;&nbsp;he would pretty certainly have stood higher as a man. He&nbsp;was, moreover, really sinned against, if still more sinning.&nbsp;The conduct of Grimm to him was certainly bad; and, though&nbsp;Walpole was not his personal friend, a worse action than his&nbsp;famous letter, considering the well-known idiosyncrasy of the&nbsp;subject, would be difficult to find. It was his own fault that&nbsp;he saddled himself with the Le Vasseurs, but their conduct was&nbsp;probably, if not certainly, ungrateful in the extreme. Only&nbsp;excuses can be made for him; but the excuses for a man born,&nbsp;as Hume after the quarrel said of him, “ without a skin ” are&nbsp;numerous and strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His peculiar reputation increased after his death. During his life his personal peculiarities and the fact that his opinions&nbsp;were nearly as obnoxious to the one'party as to the other worked&nbsp;against him, but it was not so after his death. The men of&nbsp;the Revolution regarded him with something like idolatry, and&nbsp;his literary merits conciliated many who were far from idolizing&nbsp;him as a revolutionist. His style was taken up by Remardin&nbsp;de Saint Pierre and by Chateaubriand. It was employed for&nbsp;purposes quite different from those to which he had himself&nbsp;applied it, and the reaction triumphed by the very arms which&nbsp;had been most powerful in the hands of the Revolution. Byron’s&nbsp;fervid panegyric enlisted on his side all who admired Byron—&nbsp;that is to say, the majority of the younger men and women&nbsp;of Europe between 1820 and 1850—and thus different sides&nbsp;of his tradition were continued for a .full century after the&nbsp;publication of his chief books. His religious unorthodoxy&nbsp;was condoned because he never scoffed; his political heresies,&nbsp;after their first effect was over, seemed harmless from the&nbsp;very want of logic and practical spirit in them, while part at&nbsp;least of his literary secret was the common property of almost&nbsp;every one who attempted literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In religion Rousseau was undoubtedly what he has been called above—a sentimental deist; but no one who reads him&nbsp;with the smallest attention can fail to see that sentimentalism&nbsp;was the essence, deism the accident of his creed. In his time&nbsp;orthodoxy at once generous and intelligent hardly existed in&nbsp;France. There were ignorant persons who were sincerely&nbsp;orthodox; there were intelligent persons who pretended to be&nbsp;so. But between the time of Massillon and D’Aguesseau and&nbsp;the time of Lamennais and Joseph de Maistre the class of men&nbsp;of whom in England Berkeley, Butler and Johnson were representatives did not exist in France. Little inclined by nature&nbsp;to any but the emotional side of religion, and utterly undisciplined in any other by education, course of life, or the general&nbsp;tendency of public opinion, Rousseau naturally took refuge&nbsp;in the nebulous kind of natural religion which was at once&nbsp;fashionable and convenient. If his practice fell far short even&nbsp;of his own arbitrary 'standard of morality, as much may be&nbsp;said of persons far more dogmatically orthodox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In politics, on the other hand, Rousseau was a sincere and, as far as in him lay, a convinced republican. He had no great&nbsp;tincture of learning, he was by no means a profound logician,&nbsp;and he was impulsive and emotional in the extreme—characteristics which in political matters predispose the subject to the&nbsp;preference of equality above all political requisites. He saw&nbsp;that under the French monarchy the actual result was the&nbsp;greatest misery of the greatest number, and] he did not look&nbsp;much further. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat social</span><span class="font0"> is for the political student&nbsp;one of the most curious and interesting books existing. Historically it is null; logically it is full of gaping flaws, practically&nbsp;its manipulations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volonté de tous</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">volonté générale&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">are clearly insufficient to obviate anarchy. But its mixture&nbsp;of real eloquence and apparent cogency is exactly such as&nbsp;always carries a multitude with it, if only for a time. Moreover,&nbsp;in some minor branches of politics and economics Rousseau&nbsp;was a real reformer. Visionary as his educational schemes&nbsp;(chiefly promulgated in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile)</span><span class="font0"> are in parts, they are admirable&nbsp;in others, and his protest against mothers refusing to nurse&nbsp;their children hit a blot in French life which is not removed&nbsp;yet, and has always been a source of weakness to the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But it is as a literary man pure and simple—that is to say, as an exponent rather than as an originator of ideas—that&nbsp;Rousseau is most noteworthy, and that he has exercised most&nbsp;influence. The first thing noticeable about him is that he&nbsp;defies all customary and mechanical classification. He is not&nbsp;a dramatist—his work as such is insignificant—nor a novelist,&nbsp;for, though his two chief works except the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font0"> are called&nbsp;novels, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emile</span><span class="font0"> is one only in name, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Héloïse&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is as a story diffuse, prosy and awkward to a degree.- He&nbsp;was without command of poetic form, and he could only be&nbsp;called a philosopher in an age when the term was used&nbsp;with such meaningless laxity as was customary in the 18th&nbsp;century. If he must be classed, he was before all things a&nbsp;describer—a describer of the passions of the human heart&nbsp;and of the beauties of nature. In the first part of his vocation&nbsp;the novelists of his own youth, such as Marivaux, Richardson&nbsp;and Prévost, may be said to have shown him the way, though&nbsp;he improved greatly upon them; in the second he was almost&nbsp;a creator. In combining the two and expressing the effect&nbsp;of nature on the feelings and of the feelings on the aspect of&nbsp;nature he was absolutely without a forerunner or'a model.&nbsp;And, as literature since his time has been chiefly differentiated&nbsp;from literature before it by the colour and tone resulting from&nbsp;this combination, Rousseau may be said to hold, as an influence,&nbsp;a place almost unrivalled in literary history. The defects&nbsp;of all sentimental writing are noticeable in him, but they are&nbsp;palliated by his wonderful feeling, and by the passionate&nbsp;sincerity even of his insincere passages. Some cavils have&nbsp;been made against his French, but none of much weight or&nbsp;importance. And in such passages as the famous “ Voilà de&nbsp;la pervenche ” of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> as the description of the&nbsp;isle of St Pierre in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rêveries,</span><span class="font0"> as some of the letters in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Héloïse</span><span class="font0"> and others, he had achieved absolute perfection in&nbsp;doing what he intended to do. The reader, as it has been said,&nbsp;may think he might have done something else with advantage, but&nbsp;he can hardly think that he could have done this thing better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">BiBLiOGRAPHY.—The dates of most of Rousseau’s works published during his lifetime have been given above. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rêveries,</span><span class="font0"> which, read in private, had given much umbrage to&nbsp;persons concerned, and which the author did not intend to be&nbsp;published until the end of the century, appeared in Geneva in 1782.&nbsp;In the same year and the following appeared a complete edition in&nbsp;forty-seven small volumes. There have been many since, the most&nbsp;important of them being that of Musset-Pathay (Paris, 1823). Some&nbsp;unpublished works, chiefly letters, were added by Bosscha (Paris,&nbsp;1858) and Streckeisen Moulton (Paris, 1861). See also the latter’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rousseau et ses amis</span><span class="font0"> (1865). Works on Rousseau are innumerable.&nbsp;The chief biographies are: in French that of Saint Marc Girardin&nbsp;(1874), in English the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> by Viscount Morley. But the materials&nbsp;for his biography are so controversial and so personal—his own&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font0"> and the memoirs of associates whose, accuracy and&nbsp;honesty are disputed—that the correct historical view can hardly&nbsp;be said yet to be standardized. Mrs Frederika Macdonald, in her&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jean Jacques Rousseau</span><span class="font0"> (1906), makes out a good case for regarding&nbsp;Mme. d Épinay’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font0"> as coloured, if not actually dictated, by&nbsp;the malevolent attitude of Grimm and Diderot; and her study of&nbsp;the documents undoubtedly qualifies a good many of the assumptions that have been made on the strength of evidence which is at&nbsp;least tainted by contemporary prejudice, and leaves the way open&nbsp;for an interpretation of the facts which would reconcile Rousseau’s&nbsp;character as a writer with his actions as a man. Unfortunately&nbsp;for the consistency of historical writing, the view taken of Rousseau s&nbsp;biography affects those of Grimm, Diderot, Mme. d’Épinay and&nbsp;others, and while Mr&amp; Macdonald’s researches have done much to&nbsp;suggest a rehabilitation of Rousseau’s veracity they, have not&nbsp;definitely been accepted to an extent which would justify the&nbsp;rewriting of these other lives in her sense.
