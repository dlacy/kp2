<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a great donor of relics to the monastery at Exeter. A list occupying more than three columns is given in the Leofric&nbsp;missal. It includes fragments of the candle which the&nbsp;angel of the Lord lit in the tomb of Christ, of the burning&nbsp;bush whence Jehovah spoke to Moses, and of . one of the&nbsp;stones which slew the protomartyr Stephen. Edward the&nbsp;Confessor and Louis IX. of France may be named among&nbsp;the saintly patrons of a commerce which they at least considered meritorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The mention of this last name involves a reference to an event which, above all others of the Middle Ages,&nbsp;spread, fostered, and ultimately injured the veneration of&nbsp;relics. The crusades created a profound excitement in&nbsp;this matter. Pilgrims had already thought it a default&nbsp;to return from Palestine without some such evidence that&nbsp;they had actually visited the Holy Land. Relics, at first&nbsp;probably bought and sold in good faith, became multiplied ; and rival possessions of most sacred memorials (as,&nbsp;for instance, the crown of thorns, exhibited both by the&nbsp;abbey of St Denys and by St Louis) were by no means&nbsp;uncommon. Even the crime of theft seems to have been&nbsp;condoned when a relic was in question, and mutilation&nbsp;of a saint’s body to have been hardly thought irreverent.&nbsp;To swear by these relics became the most binding of oaths,&nbsp;as will be remembered by those who have read the life&nbsp;of King Robert II. of France, and the ruse practised on&nbsp;Harold by William, duke of Normandy. Marauding&nbsp;campaigns between monastery and monastery were by no&nbsp;means uncommon; but these sink into insignificance compared with the spoliation exercised by the crusaders from&nbsp;the West who captured and sacked Constantinople in&nbsp;1203-4. The shameful behaviour of the conquering army&nbsp;is admitted by the Latins themselves; but the condemnation freely uttered against licence, brutality, and profane&nbsp;irreverence seems generally (though not quite universally)&nbsp;hushed when the spoliation concerns treasure in the way&nbsp;of relics. The fact of their abundance shows an agreement on this point, amidst their differences, between the&nbsp;Latin and Greek Churches ; but Constantinople roust have&nbsp;been greatly impoverished by the immense supply of relics&nbsp;“ that were scattered by this revolution over the churches&nbsp;of Europe.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The next two centuries saw no diminution of such zeal, and there grew up, it can hardly be doubted, an increase&nbsp;of lower motives and of fraud. By the time of the&nbsp;Reformation the condition of matters was such as in many&nbsp;respects to offer a mark for all assailants of the existing&nbsp;state of things, and a practical admission on the part of&nbsp;those in authority that it was to a large extent simply&nbsp;indefensible. Erasmus, on this as on so many other&nbsp;kindred subjects, is found leading the van of satirists.&nbsp;One of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colloquia,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peregrinatio Religionis Ergo</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;contains within some thirty pages a mass of sarcasm&nbsp;against the abuses of. the age. The discharge of vows&nbsp;through an agent, the localism of particular favours, the&nbsp;earthly (and sometimes evil) character of the petitions&nbsp;offered to saints and specially to the Virgin Mother, the&nbsp;strange character of the relics, one of the most common&nbsp;and abundant being the “ caeleste lac beatge Virginis,”&nbsp;the enormous amount of wealth lying idle at the shrine of&nbsp;St Thomas k Becket—these and similar topics are treated in&nbsp;this author’s caustic and elegant Latinity. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colloquia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">were published in 1522, and from this date a mass of similar&nbsp;literature in the vernacular tongue of various countries,&nbsp;of a coarser kind and more adapted to the popular taste,&nbsp;seems to have been circulated freely throughout Europe.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The reaction against the homage paid to relics was immense. A practice which has not only been extensively&nbsp;abused, but which appears from its very nature to involve&nbsp;a fatal facility of abuse, can never stand quite ■where it&nbsp;did after such an exposure as that to wliich reference&nbsp;has been made. Yet it seems doubtful whether the&nbsp;Reformers in all cases intended to do more than check the&nbsp;prominent abuses connected with relics. Those who&nbsp;claimed Holy Scripture as the sole authority could not&nbsp;deny that it might please the Almighty to convey&nbsp;blessings through the instrumentality of such material&nbsp;things, as in the cases already referred to in the second&nbsp;book of Kings and the Acts of the Apostles. Even&nbsp;Luther seems rather to denounce mistakes concerning&nbsp;particular relics than the respect paid to recognized ones.&nbsp;In like manner the English Church, while using severe and&nbsp;contemptuous language in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Homilies</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> with reference to&nbsp;such practices as those satirized by Erasmus, has preserved&nbsp;in its calendar, among minor festivals, the days respectively chosen by the earlier mediaeval church for the&nbsp;discovery of the cross by St Helena (May 3rd) and its&nbsp;recovery by Heraclius (September 14th). Mosheim and&nbsp;other learned foreign Protestants also speak gently on such&nbsp;themes. Thus the devout Lutheran Neander, while&nbsp;mentioning in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Church History</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> some cases of deliberate&nbsp;fraud, and holding that the superstition concerning saints&nbsp;and relics bordered nearly on paganism, is yet unable&nbsp;to approve of the extreme reaction which in some quarters&nbsp;arose out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As regards the Church of Rome, although in theory the events of the 16th century may have left its teaching&nbsp;untouched, yet it can hardly be questioned but that this&nbsp;is one of the many departments of religious life in which&nbsp;that great commotion, as De Maistre calls it, has in his&nbsp;■words, even among Roman Catholics, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">opere une revolution&nbsp;tres sensible.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The council of Trent, which must be&nbsp;regarded as, from its own point of view, a reforming&nbsp;council, treated the subject of relics in its twenty-fifth&nbsp;session, held in December 1563. It expressed its earnest&nbsp;desire for the removal of abuses, for the abolition of&nbsp;unworthy gain in the veneration of relics, and of revelry&nbsp;on occasion of their visitation. It forbade the acceptance&nbsp;by any church of new relics, without the approbation of&nbsp;the bishop, given after consultation with theologians&nbsp;and other devout men, and referred grave and difficult&nbsp;questions concerning the extirpation of abuses to the&nbsp;judgment of local councils, of metropolitans, and ultimately to the Roman see itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By these steps a great change has been effected. We hear nothing more of the sale of relics (which had indeed&nbsp;been forbidden by the fourth Lateran council in 1215), of&nbsp;theft or of war in connexion with them. Some of those&nbsp;most strange memorials to which a passing allusion has&nbsp;been made above have seemingly disappeared from history.&nbsp;And, although leading writers of the Roman obedience in&nbsp;France and Italy do not often make concessions, the&nbsp;Freiburg </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> admits the non-authenticity of numbers of relics brought home from the crusades and from&nbsp;the conquest of Constantinople; and Addis and Arnold&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Roman Catholic Dictionary</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, 1884) say that “abuses no&nbsp;doubt have occurred in all ages with regard to relics.”&nbsp;No shock less great than that caused by the Reformation&nbsp;would probably have effected so much as has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Still, however, the Church of Rome stands alone, w<sup>T</sup>e believe, in considering the possession of relics an indispensable condition of the performance of the highest acts&nbsp;of public Christian worship. Every altar used for the&nbsp;celebration of mass must, according to Roman Catholic&nbsp;rule, contain some authorized relics. These are inserted&nbsp;into a cavity prepared for their reception, called “the tomb,”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
