<p><span class="font0">by the parliament of Arbroath in April 1320 in a letter which compared Bruce to a Joshua or Judas Maccabaeus, who had&nbsp;wrought the salvation of his people, and declared they fought&nbsp;“ not for glory, truth or honour, but for that liberty which no&nbsp;virtuous man will survive.” Moved by this language and&nbsp;conscious of the weakness of Edward, the pope exhorted him&nbsp;to make peace with Scotland, and three years later Randolph,&nbsp;now earl of Moray, procured the recognition of Bruce as king&nbsp;from the papal see by promising aid for a crusade. In 1326&nbsp;the French king, Charles IV., made a similar acknowledgment&nbsp;by the treaty of Corbeil. Meantime hostilities more or less&nbsp;constant continued with England, but, though in 1322 Edward&nbsp;made an incursion as far as Edinburgh, the internal weakness&nbsp;of his government prevented his gaining any reaI success, while&nbsp;in October of this year Bruce again ravaged Yorkshire, defeated&nbsp;the English' near Byland, and almost captured their king. Some&nbsp;of his chief nobles—Thomas, earl of Lancaster, in 1321, and Sir&nbsp;Andrew Harclay, earl of Carlisle, in 1322—entered into correspondence with the Scots, and, though Harclay’s treason was&nbsp;detected and punished by his death, Edward was forced to&nbsp;make a truce of thirteen years at Newcastle on the 30th of May&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1323,</span><span class="font0"> which Bruce ratified at Berwick. In 1327 Edward III.&nbsp;became king of England, and one of the first acts of the new&nbsp;reign, after a narrow escape of the young king from capture&nbsp;by Moray, was the treaty of York, ratified at Northampton in&nbsp;ApriI 1328, by which it was agreed that “ Scotland, according&nbsp;to its ancient bounds in the days of Alexander III., should&nbsp;remain to Robert, king of Scots, and his heirs free and divided&nbsp;from England, without any subjection, servitude, claim or&nbsp;demand whatsoever.” Joanna, Edward’s sister, was to be given&nbsp;in marriage to David, the infant son of Bruce, born subsequent&nbsp;to the settlement of 1318 and now recognized as heir to the&nbsp;crown, and the ceremony was celebrated at Berwick on the&nbsp;12th of July 1328.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief author of Scottish independence barely survived his work. He appears to have conducted an expedition to&nbsp;Ireland in 1327, and on his return led a foray into England.&nbsp;His last years were chiefly spent at the castle of Cardross on&nbsp;the Clyde, which he acquired in 1326, and the conduct of war,&nbsp;as well as the negotiations for peace, had been left to the young&nbsp;leaders, Moray and Sir James Douglas, whose training was one&nbsp;of Bruce’s services to his country. Ever active, he employed&nbsp;himself in the narrower sphere of repairing the castle and improving its domains and gardens, in shipbuilding on the Clyde,&nbsp;and in the exercise of the virtues of hospitality and charity.&nbsp;The religious feeling, which had not been absent even during&nbsp;the struggles of manhood, deepened in old age, and took the&nbsp;form the piety of the times prescribed. He made careful&nbsp;provision for his funeral, his tomb, and masses for his soul. He&nbsp;procured from the pope a bull authorizing his confessor to&nbsp;absolve him even at the moment of death. He died at Cardross&nbsp;from leprosy, contracted in the hardships of earlier life, on the&nbsp;7th of June 1329, and was buried at Dunfermline beside his&nbsp;second wife, Elizabeth (d. 1327), daughter of Richard de Burgh,&nbsp;earl of Ulster, whom he had married about 1304, and who bore&nbsp;him late his only son, David, who succeeded him. Of two&nbsp;surviving daughters, Matilda married Thomas Ysaak, a simple&nbsp;esquire, and Margaret became the wife of William, earl of&nbsp;Sutherland. Marjorie, an only child by his first wife, Isabella,&nbsp;daughter of Donald, earl of Mar, had predeceased him. Several&nbsp;children not born in wedlock have been traced in the records,&nbsp;but none of them became in any way famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fulfilment of a vow to visit the Holy Sepulchre, which he could not accomplish in, person, Bruce requested Douglas to carry his&nbsp;heart there, but his faithful follower perished on the way, fighting&nbsp;in Spain against the Moors, and the heart of Bruce, recovered by&nbsp;Sir William Keith, found its resting-place at Melrose. When his&nbsp;corpse was disinterred in 1821 the breast-bone was found severed&nbsp;to admit of the removal of the heart, thus confirming the story&nbsp;preserved in the verses of Barbour. That national poet collected&nbsp;in the earliest Scottish poem, written in the reign of Bruce’s grandson, the copious traditions which clustered round his memory.&nbsp;It is a panegyric ; but history has not refused to accept it as a&nbsp;genuine representation of the character of the great king, in spirit,&nbsp;if not in every detail. Its dominant note is freedom—the liberty&nbsp;of the nation from foreign bondage, and of the individual from&nbsp;oppression. It is the same note which Tacitus embodied in&nbsp;the speech of Galgacus at the dawn of, Scottish history. Often&nbsp;as it has been heard before and since in the course of history,&nbsp;seldom has it had a more illustrious champion than Robert the&nbsp;Bruce.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROBERT IL (1316-1390), called “the Steward,” king of Scotland, was a son of Walter, the steward of Scotland (d. 1326),&nbsp;and Marjorie (d. 1316), daughter of King Robert the Bruce,&nbsp;and was born on the 2nd of March 1316. In 1318 the Scottish&nbsp;parliament decreed that if King Robert died ^without sons&nbsp;the crown should pass to his grandson; but the birth of a&nbsp;son, afterwards King David II., to Bruce in 1324 postponed&nbsp;the accession of Robert for nearly forty-two years. Soon after&nbsp;the infant David became king in 1329, the Steward began to&nbsp;take a prominent part in the affairs of Scotland. He was one&nbsp;of the leaders of the Scottish army at the battle of Halidon&nbsp;Hill in July 1333; and after gaining some successes over the&nbsp;adherents of Edward Baliol in the west of Scotland, he and&nbsp;John Randolph, 3rd earl of Moray (d. 1346), were chosen as&nbsp;regents of the kingdom, while David sought safety in France.&nbsp;The colleagues soon quarrelled; then Randolph fell into the&nbsp;hands of the English and Robert became sole regent, meeting&nbsp;with such success in his efforts to restore the royal authority&nbsp;that the king was able to return to Scotland in 1341. Having&nbsp;handed over the duties of government to David, the Steward&nbsp;escaped from the battle of Neville’s Cross in 1346, and was&nbsp;again chosen regent while the king was a captive in England.&nbsp;Soon after this event some friction arose between Robert and&nbsp;his royal uncle. Accused, probably without truth, of desertion&nbsp;at Neville’s Cross, the Steward as heir-apparent was greatly&nbsp;chagrined by the king’s proposal to make Edward III. of&nbsp;England, or one of his sons, the heir to the Scottish throne,&nbsp;and by David’s marriage with Margaret Logie. In 1363 he&nbsp;rose in rebellion, and after having made his submission was&nbsp;seized and imprisoned together with four of his sons, being&nbsp;only released a short time before David’s death in February&nbsp;1371. By the terms of the decree of 1318 Robert now succeeded&nbsp;to the throne, and was crowned at Scone in March. 1371. His&nbsp;reign in unimportant. Some steps were taken by the nobles to&nbsp;control the royaI authority. In 1378 a war broke out <sup>i</sup>With&nbsp;England; but the king took no part in the fighting, which&nbsp;included the burning of Edinburgh and the Scottish victory at&nbsp;Otterbourne in 1388. As age and infirmity were telling upon&nbsp;him, the estates in 1389 appointed his second surviving son&nbsp;Robert, earl of Fife, afterwards duke of Albany, guardian&nbsp;of the kingdom. The king died at Dundonald on the 13th of&nbsp;May 1390, and was buried at Scone. His first wife was&nbsp;Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Mure of Rowallan, a lady&nbsp;who had formerly been his mistress. By her he had at Ieast&nbsp;four sons, the eldest of whom was his successor, King Robert III.,&nbsp;and six daughters. By his second wife, Euphemia, daughter&nbsp;of Hugh, earl of Ross, and widow of Moray, formerly his-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
