The Poles and Swedes indeed continued to be very formidable enemies ; and, by the inſtigation of the former, the Crirn Tartars, in 157τ, again invaded the country with an army of 70,000 men. The Ruffians, who might have prevented their paſſing the Volga, retired before them till they came within 18 miles of the city of Moſcow, where they were totally defeated. The Czar no ſooner heard this news than he retired with his moſt valuable effects to a well-fortified cloyſter ; upon which the Tartars entered the city, plundered it, and ſet fire to ſeveral churches. A violent ſtorm which happened at the ſame lime ſoon ſpread the flames all over the city ; which was entirely reduced to aſhes in fix hours, though its circumference was upwards of 40 miles. The fire likewiſe communicated· itſelf to a powder-magazine at ſome diſtance from the city ; by which accident upwards of 50 rods of the city wall, with all the buildings upon it, were deſtroyed ; and, according to the beſt hiſtorians, upwards of x20,000 citizens were burnt or buried in the ruins, befides women, children, and foreigners. The caſtle, however, vyhich was ſtrongly fortified, could not be taken; and the Tartars hearing that a formidable army was coming againſt them under the command of Magnus duke of Holſtein, whom Bafilovitz had made king of Livonia, thought proper to retire. The war, never-theleſs, continued with the Poles and Swedes ; and the Czar being defeated by the latter after ſome trifling ſucceſs, was reduced to the neceſſity of ſuing for peace. But the negotiations being ſomehow or other broken off, the war was renewed with the greateſt vigour. The Livonians, Poles, and Swedes, having united in a league together againſt the Ruffians, gained great advantages over them; and, in 1579, Stephen Battori, who was then raiſed to the throne of Poland, levied an army expreſsly with a deſign of invading Ruſſia, and of regaining all that Poland had formerly claimed, which indeed was little leſa than the whole empire. Aa the Roles underſtood the art of war much better than the Ruffians, Bafilovitz found his undiſeiplined multitudes unable to cope with the regular forces of his enemies : and their conqueſts were fo rapid, that he was ſoon obliged to ſue for peace : which, however, was not granted ; and it is poſſible that the number of enemies which now attacked Ruſſia might have overcome the empire entirely, had not the allies grown jealous of each other; the conſequence of which was, that in 1582 a peace was concluded with the Poles, in which the Swedes were not comprehended. However, the Swedes finding themſelves unable to effect any thing of moment after the deſertion of their allies, were fain to conclude a truce ; ſhortly after which the Czar, having been worſted in an engagement with the Tartars, died in the year 1584.</p><p>This great prince was ſucceeded by his ſon Theodore Ivanovitfc ; a man of ſuch weak underſtanding, that he was totally unfit for government. Under him, therefore, the Ruffian affairs fell into confuſion ; and Boris Gudenov, a nobleman whoſe fiſter Theodore had married, found means to affume all the authority. At laſt, unable to bear even the name of a ſuperior, he reſolved to uſurp the throne. For this purpoſe he cauſed the Czar’s brother Demetrius, at that time only •nine years of age, to be affaſſinated ; and afterwards, knowing that no truſt could be put in an aſſaffin, he cauſed him alfo to be murdered left he ſhould divulge the ſecret. In 1597 the Czar himſelf was taken ill and died, not without great ſuſpicion of his being poi-ſoned by Gudenov ; of which indeed the Czarina was ſo well convinced, that ſhe would never afterwards ſpeak to her brother.</p><p>With Theodore ended' the line of Ruric, who had governed the empire of Ruſſia for upwards of 700 years. Boris, who in reality was poffeffed of all the power, and would indeed have ſuffered nobody elſe to reign, artfully pretended to be unwilling to accept the crown, till compelled to it by the intreaties of the people ; and even then he put the acceptance of it on the iffue of an expedition which he was about to undertake againſt the Tartars. The truth of the matter, however, was, that no Tartar army was in the field, nor had Boris any intention of invading that country ; but by this pretence he aiΓembled an army of 500,000 men, which he thought the moſt effectual method of ſecuring himſelf in his new dignity. In 1600 he concluded a peace with the Poles, but reſolved to continue the war againſt the Swedes ; however, being diſappoint-ed in ſome of his attempts againſt that nation, he entered into an a∏iance with the Swediſh monarch, and even propoſed a match between the king’s brother and his daughter. But while theſe things were in agitation, the city of Moſcow was defolated by one of the moſt dreadful famines recorded in hiſtory. Thouſands of people lay dead in the ſtreets and highways, with their mouths full of hay, ſtraw, or even the moſt filthy things which they had been attempting to eat. In many houſes the fatteſt perfon was killed in order to ſerve for food to the reſt. Parents were ſaid to have eaten their children, and children their parents, or to have fold them to buy bread. One author (Petrius) ſays, that he himſeli ſaw a woman bite ſeveral pieces out of a child’s arm as ſhe was carrying it along; and captain Margaret relates, that four women having ordered <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  peaſant to come to one of their houſes, under pretence of paying him for ſome wood, killed and eat up both him and his horſe. This dreadful calamity laſted three years, notwithſtand-ing all the means which Boris could uſe to alleviate it ; and in this time upwards of 500,000 people periſhed ia the city.</p><p>In 1604 a young man appeared, who pretended to be Demetrius, whom Boris had cauſed to ſhe murdered, as we have already ſeen. Being ſupported by the Poles, he .proved very troubleſome to Boris all his lifetime ; and after his death deprived Theodore Boriflbvitz, the new Czar, of the empire ; after which he aſcended the throne himſelf, and married a Poliſh princeſs. However, he held the empire but a iħort time, being killed in an inſurrection of his ſubjectsj and the unhappy Czarina was ſent priſoner to Jaroflaw.</p><p>After the death of Demetrius, Ztrflti, who had conſpired againſt him, was choſen Czar; but rebellions continually taking place, and the empire being perpetually haraffed by the Poles and Swedes, in 1610 Zuſki was depoſed, and Uladi∏aus ſon of Sigiſmund king of Poland was elected. However, the Poles repreſenting to Sigiſmund, that it would be more glorious for him to be the conqueror of Ruſſia, than only the father of its ſovereign, he carried on the war with ſuch fury, that the Ruffians-in deſpair fell upon the Poles, who refided in great numbers at Moſcow.
