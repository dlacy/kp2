      " The sounds denoted by the same symbol r differ con-siderably. First, there is the true consonantal r—our English r in reed, &c.—produced by raising the tip only of the tongue towards the front palate ; the voice escapes by this aperture, the side passages between the tongue and the palate being closed ; the mechanism, therefore, is just the opposite to that which produces I (see letter L). Secondly, there is the vowel r ; this is due to the space between the tip of the tongue and the palate being suffi-ciently great to allow the voice to escape without any friction ; the difference between this and consonantal r is parallel to that between u and w, or between i and y. This vowel-sound, though not heard regularly in any modern language, is not unfrequent in several in certain combina-tions; for example, it is quite possible to articulate “father” as “fath-r,” where the r alone forms a syllable and is there-fore vocalic. This vowel-sound was a regular sound in Sans-krit, and was probably also heard in the parent language ; but in the derived languages (except Sanskrit) it became consonantal r with an independent vowel preceding or following; thus a presumed original “krd” ( = heart), where r denotes the vocalic r, gave in Sanskrit “hrd,” in Greek κραδ-ίη, in Latin “ cor(d).” Thirdly, r may denote a trill,—that is to say, a sound produced by the vibration of the tongue when laid loosely against the palate and set in motion by a strong current of breath or voice. When the point of the tongue is laid loosely in this way against the palate just behind the gums and made to trill as voice passes over it, we hear the Scotch and the French r, each of which is a trill, not a consonantal r. The same sound, but unvoiced, is heard in the French “ théâtre,” &c., and is also the Welsh rh. A similar trill at the back part of the palate gives the Northumbrian “burr.”\n",

      " Rabbi (רבי, ραββεί, Matt, xxiii. 7, &c.), “my teacher,” is the title of a teacher fully ordained in Pales-tine. Rabbän, “our teacher” or “our lord,” but also “ their,” i.e., all Israel’s, teacher (רבן, later form of רבם), was the title of the prince (president of the synedrium) from the time of Gamliel I. (the Gamaliel of St Paul) and onward. If a prince-president sprang from any other house than Hillels, who was a descendant of David through the female line (as, for example, R. El'azar b. 'Azaryah), he was not called by this highest title of honour. The only ex-ception to this rule was Rabbän Yohanan b. Zakkai, to whom Jewish traditional lore owes so much,—nay, its very existence. For he not merely had a distinguished circle of pupils of his own (Aboth, ii. 8, 9), but he saved the lives of the members of the synedrium and secured its free activity. Vespasian, who knew him to have been friendly to the cause of Rome, granted him “ Yamnia and its sages” at his request (T. B., Gittin, 56b). In Babylonia, again, Rabbana (Rab-bono) was the title of the Rêsh Gäluthä, or “ head of the captivity.” He who bore it was always the reigning de-scendant of the house of David in the male line. The only person on whom this title was bestowed, though he was not Rêsh Gäluthä, was Rab Ashe (T. B., Kethuboth, 22a), the principal editor of the Babylonian Talmud, who is reported to have united in his person riches, learning, and virtues such as no man had possessed since the time of “ Rabbi,” the principal editor of the Mishnah (T. B., Gittin, 59a).\n",

Abbä Arëkhâ was the most successful teacher of the Law and interpreter of the Mishnah in Babylonia, having brought the latter with him from Palestine, where he had received it orally and directly from Rabbi Yehudah Hannasi ; he taught it to more than 1200 pupils, whom he is related to have housed, fed, and clothed (T. B., Kethuboth, 106a). He introduced many religious and moral reforms, notably in connexion with marriage, which are law among the Jews of all countries to this day. His Hebrew prose approaches the sublimity of the Old Testa-ment poetry, as may be seen from the tripartite “addi-tional service ” recited by all Rabbinic Jews on the two days of the “ New Year.” He is also in Babylonia the sole representative of the sublime Palestinian Agadöth, which so closely resemble the words of the Founder of Christianity. In patience with others, and especially with his shrewish wife, he surpassed Job himself. He died as the first head of the academy of Sürä (somewhat later identified with Mäthä Mehasyä) in 247 a.d., more than eighty years old.\n",

In this classical work the whole of the subject is treated throughout in a scientific manner ; the species are described with a clear discernment of really distinctive characters, the description being generally accompanied with a faithful outline figure of the head, and with a critical examination of the literature. Schlegel, besides, has the merit of having recognized the great importance of exactness with regard to localities, and of giving a general account of the geographical distribution of Snakes. The principle of classification adopted by Schlegel, indeed, is not one which will be recognized as final or even as legitimate at the present time, but it is one which is preferable to that employed by Müller, Duméril, and Bibron, which led, as we shall see presently, to the most artificial grouping of species. He divided the Snakes into families according to their “ physiognomy,” that is “ Pimpression totale que fait sur nous l’ensemble d’un être quelconque, impression que Pon peut sentir, mais qu’il est impossible de rendre au moyen de paroles ; elle est le résultat de l’harmonie de toutes les parties isolées, dont on embrasse la confirmation d’un coup d’oeil, et dans leurs rapports mutuels.” Schlegel had no training in, or knowledge of, anatomy; he, therefore, ignored Müller’s researches which appeared a few years before his work ; yet it is noteworthy that his classification stands in the main, and has not yet been superseded. He divides Snakes as follows :—\n",

      " The progress made in ophiology from the time of the appearance of this work down to the present period consists rather in the increase of our knowledge of the great variety of species and genera than in the further development of the system. Gray, Reinhardt, Peters, Günther, Cope, Bocage, Jan, Krefft, and others described a large number of forms, so that the number of those known to Duméril and Bibron has now been perhaps trebled or quadrupled.

The classification, which was much behind its time, was fixed by the former of the two authors, so that the latter had to accommodate the arrangement of his part to that of his predecessor. However, he strongly opposed the application of the character of grooved posterior teeth to the formation of large sections, and generally adopted the principle advocated by Schlegel, whose generic groups were raised into families. A great number of Snakes unknown to Duméril are described in these catalogues, whilst others which happened not to be represented in the British Museum are omitted.\n",
