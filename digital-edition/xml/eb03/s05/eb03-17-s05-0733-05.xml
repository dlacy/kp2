is the name given in our language to the viſible moiſt vapour which ariſes nom all bodies which contain juices eaſily expelled from them by heats not sufficient for their combustion. Thus we say, the ſteam of boiling water, of malt, of a tan-bed, &amp;c. It is distinguiſhed from smoke by its not having been produced by combuſtion, by not containing any soot, and by its being condenſible by cold into water, oil, inflammable ſpirits, or liquids compoſed of theſe.</p><p>We ſee it riſe in great abundance from bodies when they are heated, forming a white cloud, which diffuſes itſelf and diſappears at no very great diſtance from the body from which it was produced. In this cafe the ſurrounding air is found loaded with the water or other juices which seem to have produced it, and the steam ſeems to be completely soluble in air, as ſalt is in water, compoſing while thus united a transparent elaſtic fluid.</p><p>But in order to its appearance in the form of an opaque white cloud, the mixture with or disſemination in air ſeem abſolutely neceſſary. If a tea-kettle boils violently, ſo that the ſteam is formed at the ſpout in great abundance, it may be obſerved, that the viſible cloud is not formed at the very mouth of the ſpout, but at a ſmall diſtance before it, and that the vapour is perfectly tranſparent at its first emiſſion. This is rendered ſtill more evident by fitting to the ſpout of the tea-kettle a glaſs pipe of any length, and of as large a diameter as we please. The fleam is produced as copiouſly as without this pipe, but the vapour is tranſparent through the whole length of the pipe. Nay, if this pipe communicate with a glaſs velſel terminating in another pipe, and if the vesſel be kept ſufficiently hot, the ſteam will be as abundantly produced at the mouth of this second pipe as before, and the veſſel will be quite tranſparent. The viſibility therefore of the matter which constitutes the ſteam is an accidental or extraneous circumſtance, and requires the admixture with air ; yet this quality again leaves it when united with air by ſolution. It appears therefore to require a <hi rend="italic">diſſemination</hi> in the air. The appearances are quite agreeable to this notion : for we know that one perfectly tranſparent body, when minutely divided and diffused among the parts of another tranſparent body, but not diſſolved in it, makes a maſs which is viſible. Thus oil beat up with water makes a white opaque maſs.</p><p>In the mean time, as ſteam is produced, the water gradually waſtes in the tea kettle, and will ſoon be totally expended, if we continue it on the fire. It is reaſonable therefore to ſuppoſe, that this ſteam is nothing but water changed by heat into an aerial or elaſtic form. If ſo, we ſhould expect that the privation of this heat would leave it in the form of water again. Accordingly this is fully verified by experiment ; for if the pipe fitted to the ſpout oſ the tea-kettle be ſurrounded with cold water, no ſteam will issue, but water will continually trickle from it in drops ; and if the proceſs be conducted with the proper precautions, the water which we thus obtain from the pipe will be found<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0740.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0734"/>
equal in quantity to that which diſappears from the teakettle.</p><p>This is evidently the common proceſs for diſtilling ; and the whole appearances may be explained by ſayin'g, that the water is converted by heat into an elaſtic vapour, and that this, meeting with colder air, imparts to it the heat which it carried off as it aroſe from the heated water, and being deprived of its heat it is again water. The particles of this water being vaſtly more remote from each other than when they were in the teakettle, and thus being diſſeminated in the air, become viſible, by reflecting light from their anterior and poſterior ſurfaces, in the ſame manner as a tranſparent ſalt becomes viſible when reduced to a fine powder. This diſſeminated water being preſented to the air in a very -extended ſurface, is quickly diſſolved by it, as pounded salt is in water, and again becomes a tranſparent fluid, but of a different nature from what it was before, being no longer convertible into water by depriving it of its heat.</p><p>Accordingly this opinion, or ſomething very like it, has been long entertained. Muſchenbroeck expreſsly ſays, that the water in the form of vapour carries off with it all the heat which is continually thrown in by the fuel. But Dr Black was the first who attended minutely to the whole phenomena, and enabled us to form diſtinct notions of the ſubject. He had diſcovered that it was not sufficient for converting ice into water that it be raiſed to that temperature in which it can no longer remain in the form of ice. A piece of ice of the temperature 32⁰ of Fahrenheit’s thermometer will remain a very long while in air of the temperature 50 <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> before it be all melted, remaining all the while of the temperature 32⁰, and therefore continually absorbing hear from the ſurrounding air. By comparing the time in which the ice had its temperature changed from 28⁰ to 32⁰ with the ſubſequent time of its complete liquefaction, he found that it abſorbed about 130 or 140 times as much heat as would raiſe its temperature one degree ; and he found that one pound of ice, when mixed with one pound of water 140 degrees warmer, was just melted, but without riſing in its temperature above 32⁰. Hence he juſtly concluded, that water differed from ice of the fame temperature by containing, as a conſtituent ingredient, a great quantity of fire, or of the cauſe of heat, united with it in ſuch a way as r.ot to quit it for another colder body, and therefore ſo as not to go into the liquor of the thermometer and expand it. Conſidered therefore as the poſſible cauſe of heat, it was latent, which Dr Black expreſſed by the abbreviated term <hi rend="smallcaps">latent heat.</hi> If any more heat was added to the water it was not latent, but would readily quit it for the thermometer, and, by expanding the thermometer, would ſhow what is the degree of this r <hi rend="italic">edundant</hi> heat, while fluidity alone is the indication of the <hi rend="italic">combined</hi> and latent heat</p><p>Dr Black, in like manner, concluded, that in order to convert water into an elaſtic vapour, it was neceſſary, not only to increaſe its uncombined heat till its temperature is 212⁰, in which ſtate it is just ready to become elaſtic ; but alſo to pour into it a great quantity of fire, or the cauſe of heat, which combines with every particle of it, ſo as to make it repel, or to recede from, ſt3 adjoining particles, and thus to make it a particle ot an elastic fluid. He ſuppoſed that this additional heat might be combined with it ſo as not to quit it for the thermometer; and therefore ſo as to be in a latent ſtate, having elaſtic fluidity for its sole indication.</p><p>This opinion was very conſiſtent with the phenomenon of boiling off a quantity of water. The application of heat to it cauſes it gradually to rife in its temperature till it reaches the temperature 212⁰. It then begins to ſend off elaſtic vapour, and is ſlowly expended in this way, continuing all the while of the ſame temperature. The fleam alſo is of no higher temperature, as appears by holding a thermometer in it. We muſt conclude that this fleam contains all the heat which is expended in its formation. Accordingly the ſealding power of steam is well known ; but it is extremely difficult to obtain preciſe meaſures of the quantity of heat abſorbed by water during its converſion into fleam. Dr Black endeavoured to aſcertain this point, by comparing the time of railing its temperature a certain number of degrees with the time of boiljng it off by the ſame external heat ; and he found that the heat latent in ſteam, which balanced the preſſure of the at- moſphere, was not less than 80o degrees. He alſo directed Dr Irvine of Glaſgow to the form of an experiment for meaſuring the heat actually extricated from ſuch ſteam during its condenſation in the refrigeratory ot a Hill, which was found to be not leſs than 774 degrees. Dr Black was afterwards informed by Mr Watt, that a courſe of experiments, which he had made in each oſ theſe ways with great preciſion, determined the latent heat of fleam under the ordinary preſſure of the atmosphere to be about 948 or 950 degrees. Mr Watt alſo found that water would distil with great eaſe <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> when of the temperature 70°; and that in this cafe the latent heat of the fleam is not leſs than 1200 or 1300 degrees : and a train of experiments, which he had made by diſtilling in different temperatures, made him conclude that the ſum of the ſenſible and latent heats is a confiant quantity. This is a curious and not an improbable circumstance ; but we have no information of the particulars of theſe experiments. The con- cluſion evidently preſuppoſes a knowledge of that particular temperature in which the water has no heat ; but this is a point which is still <hi rend="italic">ſub judice.</hi></p><p>This converſion of liquids (for it is not confined to water, but obtains alſo in ardent ſpirits, oils, mercury, &amp;c.) is the cauſe of their boiling. The heat is applied to the bottom and fiées of the veſſel, and gradually accumulates ,in the fluid, in a ſenſible ftate, uncombined, and ready to quit it and to enter into any body that is colder, and to diffuſe itſelf between them. Thus it enters into the fluid of a thermometer, expands it, and thus gives us the indication of the degree in which it has been accumulated in the. water ; for the thermometer ſwells as long as it continues to abſorb ſenſible heat from the water : and when the ſenſible heat in both is in equilibrio, in a proportion depending on the nature of the two fluids, the thermometer rises no more, becauſe it abſorbs no more heat or fire from the water ; for the particles of water which are in immediate contact with the bottom, are now (by this gradual expansion of liquidity) a ſuch distance from each other, that their laws of attraction for each other and for heat are totally changed Each particle ei her no longer attracts, or perhaps it repels its adjoining particle, and now accumulates round itſelf a great number of the particles of<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0741.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0735"/>
heat, and forms a particle of elaſtic fluid, ſo related to the adjoining new formed particles, as to repel them to a diſtance at leaſt a hundred times greater than their distances in the ſtate of water. Thus a maſs of elaſtic vapour of ſenſible magnitude is formed. Being at leaſt ten thouſand times lighter than an equal bulk of water, it muſt riſe up through it, as a cork would do, in form of a tranſparent ball or bubble, and getting to the top, it diſſipates, filling the upper part of the veſſel with vapour or steam. Thus, by toſſing the liquid into bubbles, which are produced all over the bottom and sides of the veſſel, it produces the phenomenon of ebullition or boiling. Obſerve, that during its paſſage up through the water, it is not changed or condenſed ; for the ſurrounding water is already ſo hot that the ſenſible or uncombined beat in it, is in equilibrio with that in the vapour, and therefore it is not diſpoſed to abſorb any of that heat which is combined as an ingredient of this vapour, and gives it its elaſticity. For this reaſon, it happens that water will not boil till its whole maſs be heated up to 212⁰ ; for if the upper part be colder, it robs the riſing bubble of that heat which is neceſſary for its elaſticity, ſo that it immediately collapſes again, and the ſurface of the water remains ſtill. This may be perceived by holding water in a Florence flaſk over a lamp or choſſer. It will be obſerved, ſome time before the real ebullition, that ſome bubbles are formed at the bottom, and get up a very little way, and then diſappear. The diſtances which they reach before collapſing increaſe as the water continues to warm farther up the maſs, till at laſt it breaks cut into boiling. If the handle of a tea-kettle be graſped with the hand, a tremor will be felt for ſome little time before boiling, ariſing from the little ſuccuſſions which are produced by the collapſing of the bubbles of vapour. This is much more violent, and is really a remarkable phenomenon, if we ſuddenly plunge a lump of red hot iron into a veſſel of cold water, taking care that no red part be near the ſurface. If the hand be now applied to the side of the veſſel, a moſt violent tremor is felt, and ſometimes ſtrong thumps : theſe ariſe from the collapſing of very large bubbles. If the upper part of the iron be too hot, it warms the ſurrounding water ſo much, that the bubbles from below come up through it uncondenſed, and produce ebullition without this ſuccuſſion. The great reſemblance of this tremor to the feeling which we have during the ſhock of an earthquake has led many to ſuppoſe that theſe laſt are produced in the ſame way, (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Earthquake,</hi> n⁰ 88 — 98); and their hypothesis, notwithſtanding the objections which we have elſewhere ſtated to it, is by no means unfeaſible.</p><p>It is owing to a similar cauſe that violent thumps are ſometimes felt on the bottom of a tea-kettle, eſpecially one which has been long in uſe. Such are frequently crusted on the bottom with a ſtony concretion. This ſometimes is detached in little ſcales. When one of theſe is adhering by one end to the bottom, the water gets between them in a thin film. Here it may be heated conſiderably above the boiling temperature, and it ſuddenly riſes up in a large bubble, which collapſes immediately. A ſmooth ſhilling lying on the bottom will produce this appearance very violently, or a thimble with the mouth down.</p><p>In order to make water boil, the fire muſt be applied to the bottom or sides of the veſſel. If the heat be applied at the top of the water, it will waste away without boiling ; for the very ſuperficial particles are firſt ſupplied with the heat neceſſary for rendering them elaſtic, and they fly off without agitating the rest<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> We explained the opaque and cloudy appearance of steam, by ſaying that the vapour is condenſed by coming into contact with the cooler air. There is ſomething in the form of this cloud which is very inexplicable. The particles of it are ſometimes very diſtinguiſhable by the eye ; but they have not the ſmart ſtar like brilliancy of very ſmall drops of water, but give the fainter reflection of a very thin film or veſicle like a ſoap-bubble. If we attend also to their motion, we ſee them deſcending very ſlowly in compariſon with the deſcent of a ſolid drop ; and this vesicular conſtitution is establiſhed beyond a doubt by looking at a candle through a cloud of steam. It is ſeen ſurrounded by a faint halo with priſmatical colours, preciſely ſuch as we can demonstrate by optical laws to belong to a collection of veſicles, but totally different from the halo which would be produced by a collection of ſolid drops. It is very difficult to conceive how theſe veſicles can be formed of watery particles, each of which was ſurrounded with many particles of fire, now communicated to the air, and how each of theſe veſicles ſhall include within it a ball of air ; but we cannot refuſe the fact. We know, that if, while linſeed- oil is boiling or nearly boiling, the ſurface be obliquely struck with the ladle, it will be daſhed into a prodigious number of exceedingly ſmall veſicles, which will float about in the air ſor a long while. Mr Sauſſure was (we think) the firſt who diſtinctly obſerved this veſicular form of miſts and clouds ; and he makes considerable uſe of it in explaining ſeveral phenomena of the atmoſphere.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>Since this diſengagement of vapour is the effect of its elaſticity, and ſince this elaſticity is a determined force when the temperature is given, it follows, that fluids cannot boil till the elaſticity of the vapour overcomes the preſſure of the incumbent fluid and of the atmoſphere. Therefore, when this preſſure is removed or diminiſhed, the fluids muſt ſooner overcome what remains, and boil at a lower temperature. Accordingly it is obſerved that water will boil in an exhauſted receiver when of the heat of the human body. If two glaſs balls A and B (fig. 1.) be connected by a ſlender tube, and one of them A be filled with water (a ſmall opening or pipe <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being left at top of the other), and this be made to boil, the vapour produced from it will drive all the air out of the other, and will at laſt come out itſelf, producing ſteam at the mouth of the pipe. When the ball B is obſerved to be occupied by tranſparent vapour, we may conclude that the air is completely expelled. Now ſhut the pipe by sticking it into a piece of tallow or bees-wax ; the vapour in B will ſoon condenſe, and there will be a vacuum. The flame of a lamp and blow-pipe being directed to the little pipe, will cauſe it immediately to cloſe and ſeal hermetically. We now have a pretty inſtrument or toy called a <hi rend="smallcaps">Pulse glass.</hi> Graſp the ball A in the hollow of the hand ; the heat of the hand will immediately expand the bub-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0742.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0736"/>
ble of vapour which may be in it, and this vapour will drive the water into B, and then will blow up through it for a long while, keeping it in a ſtate of violent ebullition, as long as there remains a drop or film of water in A. But care muſt be taken that B is all the while kept cold, that it may condenſe the vapour as faſt as it riſes through the water. Touching B with the hand, or breathing warm on it, will immediately ſtop the ebullition in it. When the water in A has thus been diſſipated, graſp B in the hard ; the water will be driven into A, and the ebullition will take place there as it did in B. Putting one of the balls into the mouth will make the ebullition more violent in the other, and the one in the mouth will feel very cold. This is a pretty illuſtration of the rapid abſorption of the heat by the particles of water which are thus converted into elaſtic vapour. We have ſeen this little toy ſuſpended by the middle of the tube like a balance, and thus placed in the inſide of a window, having two holes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> cut in the pane, in ſuch a ſituation that when A is full of water and preponderates, B is oppoſite to the hole <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Whenever the room became ſufficiently warm, the vapour was formed in A, and immediately drove the water into B, which was kept cool by the air coming into the room through the hole <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> By this means B was made to preponderate in its turn, and A was then oppoſite to the hole <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the proceſs was now repeated in the oppoſite direction ; and this amuſement continued as long as the room was warm enough.</p><p>We know that liquors differ exceedingly in the temperatures neceſſary for their ebullition. This forms the great chemical diſtinction between volatile and fixed bodies. But the difference of temperature in which they boil, or are converted into permanently elaſtic vapour, under the preſſure of the atmoſphere, is not a certain meaſure of their differences of volatility. The natural boiling point of a body is that in which it will be converted into elaſtic vapour under no pressure, or <hi rend="italic">in vacuo.</hi> The boiling point in the open air depends on the law of the elaſticity oſ the vapour in relation to its heat. A fluid A may be leſs volatile, that is, may require more heat to make it boil <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> than a fluid B : But it the elaſticity of the vapour of A be more increaſed by an increaſe of temperature than that of the vapour of B, A may boil at as low, or even at a lower temperature, in the open air, than B does ; for the increaſed elaſticity of the vapour of A may ſooner overcome the preſſure of the atmoſphere. Few experiments have been made on the relation between the temperature and the elaſticity of different vapours. So long ago as the year 1765, we had occaſion to examine the boiling points of all ſuch liquors as we could manage in an air-pump ; that is, ſuch as did not produce vapours which deſtroyed the valves and the leathers of the piſtons : and we thought that the experiments gave us reaſon to conclude, that the elaſticity of all the vapours was affected by heat nearly in the ſame degree. For we found that the difference between their boiling points in the air and <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> was nearly the ſame in all, namely, about 120 degrees lof Fahrenheit’s thermometer. It is exceedingly difficult to make experiments ot this kind : The vapours are ſo condenſible, and change their elaſticity ſo prodigiouſly by a trifling change of temperature, that it is almoſt impoſſible to examine this point with preciſion. It is, however, as we ſhall ſee by and by, a ſubject of conſiderable practical importance in the mechanic arts ; and an accurate knowledge of the relation would be of great uſe alſo to the diſtiller : and it would be no leſs important to diſcover the relation of their elaſticity and denſity, by examining their compreſſibility, in the ſame manner as we have aſcertained the relation in the case of what we call <hi rend="italic">aerial fluids,</hi> that is, ſuch as we have never obſerved in the form of liquids or ſolids, except in conſequence of their union with each other or with other bodies. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics</hi> we took notice of it as ſomething like a natural law, that all theſe airs, or gaſes as they are now called, had their elaſtſeity very nearly, if not exactly proportional to their denſity. This appears from the experiments or Achard, of Fontana, and others, on vital air, inflammable air, fixed air, and ſome others. It gives us ſome preſumption to ſuppoſe that it holds in all elaſtic vapours whatever, and that it is connected with their elaſticity ; and it renders it ſomewhat probable that they are all elaſtic, only becauſe the cauſe of heat (the matter of fire if you will) is elaſtic, and that their law of elaſticity, in reſpect of denſity, is the ſame with that of fire. But it muſt be obſerved, that although we thus aſſign the elaſticity of fire as the immediate cauſe of the elaſticity of vapour, in the ſame way, and on the ſame grounds, that we aſcribe the fluidity of brine to the fluidity of the water which holds the ſolid salt in ſolution, it does not follow that this is owing, as is commonly ſuppoſed, to a repulſion or tendency to recede from each other exerted by the particles of fire. We are as much entitled to infer a repulſion of unlimited extent between the particles of water ; for we ſee that by its means a ſingle particle of ſea-ſalt becomes diſſeminated through the whole of a very large vessel. If water had not been a viſible and palpable ſubſtance, and the ſalt only had been viſible and palpable, we might have formed a ſimilar notion of chemical ſolution. But we, on the contrary, have conſidered the <hi rend="italic">quaquaverſum</hi> motion or expanſion of the ſalt as a diſſemination among the particles of water; and we have aſcribed it to the ſtrong attraction of the atoms of ſalt for the atoms of water, and the attraction of theſe laſt for each other, thinking that each atom of ſalt accumulates round itſelf a multitude of watery atoms, and by ſo doing muſt recede from the other ſaline atoms. Nay, we farther ſee, that by forces which we naturally conſider as attractions, an expanſion may be prodiiced of the whole maſs, which will act againſt external mechanical forces. It is thus that wood ſwells with almoſt insuperable force by imbibing moiſture ; it is thus that a ſponge immerſed in water becomes really an elaſtic compreſſible body, reſembling a blown bladder; and there are appearances which warrant us to apply this mode of conception to elaſtic fluids.— When air is ſuddenly compreſſed, a thermometer included in it ſhows a rise of temperature ; that is, an appearance of heat now redundant which was formerly combined. The heat ſeems to be ſqueezed out as the water from the sponge.</p><p>Accordingly this opinion, that the elaſticity of ſteam and other vapours is owing merely to the attraction for fire, and the consequent diſſemination of their particles through the whole maſs of fire, has been entertained by many naturaliſts, and it has been aſcribed entirely to attraction. We by no means pretend to decide ; but we think the analogy by far too flight to found any<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0743.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0737"/>
confident opinion on it. The aim is to ſolve phenomena by attraction only, as if it were of more eaſy conception than repulsion. Conſidered merely as facts, they are quite on a par. The appearances of nature in which we obſerve actual receſſes of the parts oſ body from each other, are as diſtinct, and as frequent and familiar, as the appearances of actual approach. And if we attempt to go farther in our contemplation, and to conceive the way and the forces by which either the approximations or receſſes of the atoms are produced, we muſt acknowledge that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have no conception of the matter ; and we can only say, that there is a cauſe of theſe motions, and we call it a force, as in every caſe of the production of motion. We call it attraction or repulſion juſt as we happen to contemplate an access or a receſs. But the analogy here is not only flight, but imperfect, and fails moſt in thoſe caſes which are moſt ſimple, and where we ſhould expect it to be moſt complete. We can ſqueeze water out of a ſponge, it is true, or out of a piece of green wood ; but when the white of an egg, the tremella, or ſome gums, ſwell to a hundred times their dry dimenſions by imbibing water, we cannot ſqueeze out a particle. If fluidity (for the reaſoning muſt equally apply to this as to vaporouſneſs) be owing to an accumulation of the extended matter of fire, which gradually expanded the ſolid by its very minute additions; and if the accumulation round a particle of ice, which is neceſſary for making it a particle of water, be ſo great in compariſon of what gives it the expanſion of one degree, as experiment obliges us to conclude—it ſeems an inevitable conſequence that all fluids ſhould be many times rarer than the ſolids from which they were produced. But we know that the difference is trifling in all caſes, and in ſome (water, for inſtance, and iron) the ſolid is rarer than the fluid. Many other arguments (each of them perhaps of little weight when taken alone, but which are all syſtematically connected) concur in rendering it much more probable that the matter of fire, in cauſing elaſticity, acts immediately by its own elaſticity, which we cannot conceive in any other way than as a mutual tendency in its particles to recede from each other ; and we doubt not but that, if it could be obtained alone, we ſhould find it an claſtic fluid like air. We even think that there are caſes in which it is obſerved in this ſtate. The elaſtic force of gunpowder is very much beyond the elaſticity of all the vapours which are produced in its deflagration, each of them being expanded as much as we can reaſonably ſuppoſe by the great heat to which they are expoſed. The writer of this article exploded ſome gunpowder mixed with a conſiderable portion of finely powdered quartz, and another parcel mixed with fine filings of copper. The elaſticity was meaſured by the penetration of the ball which was diſcharged, and was great in the degree now mentioned. The experiment was ſo conducted, that much of the quartz and copper was collected ; none of the quartz had been melted, and ſome of the copper was not melted. The heat, therefore, could not be ſuch as to explain the elaſticity by expansion of the vapours ; and it became not improbable that fire was acting here as a detached chemical fluid by its own elaſticity. But to return to our ſubject.</p><p>There is one circumſtance in which we think our own experiments show a remarkable difference (at leaſt in degree) between the condenſible and incondensible vapours. It is well known, that when air is very ſuddenly expanded, cold is produced, and heat when it is ſuddenly condenſed. When making experiments with the hopes of diſcovering the connection between the elaſticity and denſity of the vapours of boiling water, and alſo of boiling spirits of turpentine, we found the change of denſity accompanied by a change of temperature vaſtly greater than in the caſe of incoercible gaſes. When the vapour of boiling water was ſuddenly allowed to expand into five times its bulk, we obſerved the depreſſion of a large and ſensible air thermometer to be at leaſt four or five times greater than in a ſimilar expanſion of common air of the ſame temperature. The chemical reader will readily ſee reasons for expecting, on the contrary, a ſmaller alteration of temperature, both on account of the much greater rarity of the fluid, and on account of a partial condenſation of its water, and the conſequent diſengagement of combined heat.</p><p>This difference in the quantity of fire which is combined in vapours and gaſes is ſo considerable as to authorize us to ſuppoſe that there is ſome difference in the chemical conſtitution of vapours and gaſes, and that the connection between the specific baſes of the vapour and the fire which it contains is not the ſame in air, for inſtance, as in the vapour of boiling water ; and this difference may be the reaſon why the one is eaſily condensible by cold, while the other has never been exhibited in a liquid or ſolid form, except by means of its chemical union with other ſubſtances. In this particular inſtance we know that there is an eſſential difference—that in vital or atmoſpheric air there is not only a prodigious quantity of fire which is not in the vapour of water, but that it alſo contains light, or the cauſe of light, in a combined ſtate. This is fully evinced by the great discovery of Mr Cavendiſh of the composition of water. Here we are taught that water ( and conſequently its vapour) conſiſts of air from which the light and greateſt part of the fire have been ſeparated. And the ſubſequent diſeoveries of the celebrated Lavoisier ſhow, that almoſt all the condenſible gaſes with which we are acquainted consist either of airs which have already lost much of their fire (and perhaps light too), or of matters in which we have no evidence of fire or light being combined in this manner.</p><p>This consideration may go far in explaining this difference in the condenſibility of theſe different ſpecies of aerial fluids, the gaſes and the vapours ; and it is with this qualification only that we are diſpoſed to allow that all bodies are condenſible into liquids or ſolids by abſtracting the heat. In order that vital air may become liquid or ſolid, we hold that it is not sufficient that a body be preſented to it which ſhall simply abſtract its heat. This would only abſtract its uncombined fire.— But another, and much larger portion remains chemically combined by means of light. A chemical affinity muſt be brought into action which may abſtract, not the fire from the oxygen (to ſpeak in the language of Mr Lavoiſier), but the oxygen from the fire and light.

We ſhall therefore conclude this article with some other obſervations, which are also general, with reſpect to the different kinds of coercible vapours, but which have a particular relation to the following article.</p><p>Steam or vapour is an elastic fluid, whoſe elaſticſty balances the preſſure of the atmoſphere ; and it has been produced from a ſolid or liquid body raiſed to a sufficient temperature for giving it this elasticity ; that is, for causing the fluid to boil. This temperature muſt vary with the preſſure of the air. Accordingly it is found, that when the air is light (indicated by the barometer being low), the fluid will boil ſooner. When the barometer ſtands at 30 inches, water boils at the temperature 212⁰. If it ſtand ſo low as 28 inches, water will boil at 208½. In the plains of Quito, or at Gondar in Abyſſinia, where the barometer ſtands at about 21 inches, water will boil at 195⁰. Highly rectified alcohol will boil at 160⁰, and vitriolic aether will boil at 88⁰ or 89⁰. This is a temperature by no means uncommon in theſe places ; nay, the air is frequently warmer. Vitriolic aether, therefore, is a liquor which can hardly be known in thoſe countries. It is hardly poſſible to preſerve it in that form. If a phial have not its ſtopper firmly tied down, it will be blown out, and the liquor will boil and be diſſipated in ſteam. On the top of Chimboracao, the human blood muſt be diſpoſed to give out air-bubbles.</p><p>We ſaid ſome time ago, that we had concluded, from ſome experiments made in the receiver of an air-pump, that fluids boil <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> at a temperature nearly 120 degrees lower than that neceſſary for their boiling in the open air. But we now ſee that this muſt have been but a groſs approximation ; for in theſe experiments the fluids were boiling under the preſſure of the vapour which they produced, and which could not be abſtracted by working the pump. It appears from the experiments of Lord Charles Cavendiſh, mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics,</hi> that water of the temperature 72 <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> was converted into elaſtic vapour, which balanced a preſſure of ¾ths of an inch of mercury, and in this ſtate it occupied the receiver, and did not allow the mercury in the gauge to sink to the level. As fast as this was abſtracted by working the air-pump, more of it was produced from the ſurface of the water, ſo that the preſſure continued the ſame, and the water did not boil. Had it been poſſible to produce a vacuum above this water, it would have boiled for a moment, and would even have continued to boil, if the receiver could have been kept very cold.</p><p>Upon reading theſe experiments, and ſome very curious ones of Mr Nairne, in the Phil. Tranſ. vol. lxvii. the writer of this article was induced to examine more particularly the relation between the temperature of the vapour and its elaſticity, in the following manner :</p><p>ABCD (fig. 2.) is the ſection of a ſmall digeſter made of copper. Its lid, which is faſtened to the body with ſcrews, is pierced with three holes, each of which had a ſmall pipe ſoldered into it. The firſt hole was furniſhed with a braſs ſafety-valve V, nicely fitted to it by grinding. The area of this valve was exactly ¼th of an inch. There reſted on the ſtalk at top of this valve the arm of a ſteelyard carrying a sliding weight. This arm had a ſcale of equal parts, ſo adjuſted to the weight that the number on the ſcale correſponded to the inches of mercury, whoſe preſſure on the under ſurface of the valve is equal to that of the ſteelyard on its top ; ſo that when the weight was at the diviſion 10, the preſſure of the ſteelyard on the valve was just equal to that of a column of mercury 10 inches high and ¼th of an inch baſe. The middle hole contained a thermometer T firmly fixed into it, ſo that no vapour could eſcape by its sides. The ball of this thermometer was but a little way below the lid. The third hole received occaſionally the end of a glaſs-pipe S G F, whoſe deſcending leg was about 36 inches long. When this ſyphon was not uſed, the. hole was properly ſhut with a plug.</p><p>The veſſel was half filled with diſtilled water which had been purged of air by boiling. The lid was then fixed on, having the third hole S plugged tip. A lamp being placed under the veſſel, the water boiled, and the ſteam iſſued copiouſly by the ſaſety-valve. The thermometer ſtood at 213, and a barometer in the room at 29,9 inches. The weight was then put on the fifth diviſion. The thermometer immediately began to riſe ; and when it was at 220, the ſteam iſſued by the ſides of the valve. The weight was removed to the 10th diviſion; but before the thermometer could be diſtinctly obſerved, the ſteam was iſſuing at the valve. The lamp was removed farther from the bottom of the veſſel, that the progreſs of heating might be more moderate ; and when the ſteam ceaſed to iſſue from the valve, the thermometer was at 227. The weight was now ſhifted to 15 ; and by gradually approaching the lamp, the ſteam again iſſued, and the thermometer was at 132½ This mode of trial was continued all the way to the 75th diviſion of the ſcale. The experiments were then repeated in the contrary order ; that is, the weight being ſuſpended at the 75th diviſion, and the ſteam iſſuing ſtrongly at the valve, the lamp was withdrawn, and the moment the ſteam ceaſed to come out, the thermometer was obſerved. The ſame was done at the 70th, 65th, diviſion, &amp;c. Theſe experiments were ſeveral times repeated both ways ; and the means of all the reſults ſor each diviſion are expreſſed in the following table, where column lſt expreſſes the elaſticity of the ſteam, being the ſunr of 29,9, and the diviſion of the ſteelyard ; column 2d expreſſes the temperature of the ſteam correſponding to this elaſticity.</p><table> <row> <cell>1.</cell> <cell>II</cell> </row> <row> <cell>35 inches.</cell> <cell>219⁰</cell> </row> <row> <cell>40</cell> <cell>226</cell> </row> <row> <cell>45</cell> <cell>232</cell> </row> <row> <cell>50</cell> <cell>257</cell> </row> <row> <cell>55</cell> <cell>242</cell> </row> <row> <cell>60</cell> <cell>247</cell> </row> <row> <cell>65</cell> <cell>251</cell> </row> <row> <cell>70</cell> <cell>255</cell> </row> <row> <cell>75</cell> <cell>239</cell> </row> <row> <cell>80</cell> <cell>263</cell> </row> <row> <cell>85</cell> <cell>267</cell> </row> <row> <cell>90</cell> <cell>270½</cell> </row> <row> <cell>95</cell> <cell>274½</cell> </row> <row> <cell>100</cell> <cell>278</cell> </row> <row> <cell>105</cell> <cell>281</cell> </row> </table><p>A very different proceſs was necessary for aſcertaining the elaſticity of the ſteam in lower temperatures, and conſequently under ſmaller preſſures than that of the atmoſphere. The glaſs ſyphon SGF was now fixed into its hole in the lid of the digeſter. The water was made to boil ſmartly for ſome time, and the ſteam iſſued copiouſly both at the valve and at the ſyphon. The<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0745.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0739"/>
lower end of the ſyphon was now immerſed into a broad ſaucer of mercury, and the lamp inſtantly removed, and every thing was allowed to grow cold. By this the ſteam was gradually condenſed, and the mercury roſe in the ſyphon, without ſenſibly sinking in the ſaucer. The valve and all the joints were ſmeared with a thick clammy cement, compoſed of oil, tallow, and roſin, which effectually prevented all ingreſs of air. The weather was clear and froſty, the barometer ſtanding at 29,84, and the thermometer in the veſſel at 42⁰. The mercury in the ſyphon ſtood at 29,7, or ſomewhat higher, thus ſhowing a very complete condenſation. The whole veſſel was ſurrounded with pounded ice, of the temperature 32⁰. This made no ſenſible change in the height of the mercury. A mark was now made at the ſurface of the mercury. One obſerver was ſtationed at the thermometer, with inſtructions to call out as the thermometer reached the diviſions 42, 47, 52, 57, and ſo on by every five degrees till it ſhould attain the boiling heat. Another obſerver noted the correſponding deſcents of the mercury by a ſcale of inches, which had its beginning placed at 29,84 from the ſurface of the mercury in the ſaucer.</p><p>The pounded ice was now removed, and the lamp placed at a considerable diſtance below the veil’d, ſo as to warm its contents very ſlowly. Theſe obſervations being very easily made, were ſeveral times repeated, and their mean reſults are ſet down in the following table : Only obſerve, that it was found difficult to note down the deſcents for every fifth degree, becauſe they ſucceeded each other ſo faſt. Every 10th was judged ſufficient for eſtabliſhing the law of variation. The firſt column of the table contains the temperature, and the ſecond the deſcent (in inches) of the mercury from the mark 29,84.</p><table> <row> <cell>32⁰</cell> <cell>☿</cell> </row> <row> <cell>40</cell> <cell>0,1</cell> </row> <row> <cell>50</cell> <cell>0,2</cell> </row> <row> <cell>60</cell> <cell>0,35</cell> </row> <row> <cell>70</cell> <cell>0,55</cell> </row> <row> <cell>80</cell> <cell>0,82</cell> </row> <row> <cell>90</cell> <cell>1,18</cell> </row> <row> <cell>100</cell> <cell>1,61</cell> </row> <row> <cell>110</cell> <cell>2,25</cell> </row> <row> <cell>120</cell> <cell>3,00</cell> </row> <row> <cell>130</cell> <cell>3,95</cell> </row> <row> <cell>140</cell> <cell>5,15</cell> </row> <row> <cell>150</cell> <cell>6,72</cell> </row> <row> <cell>160</cell> <cell>8,65</cell> </row> <row> <cell>170</cell> <cell>11,05</cell> </row> <row> <cell>180</cell> <cell>14,05</cell> </row> <row> <cell>190</cell> <cell>17,85</cell> </row> <row> <cell>200</cell> <cell>22,62</cell> </row> <row> <cell>210</cell> <cell>28,65</cell> </row> </table><p>Four or five numbers at the top of the column of elaſticities are not ſo accurate as the others, becauſe the mercury paſſed pretty quickly through theſe points. But the progreſs was extremely regular through the remaining points ; ſo that the elaſticities correſponding to temperatures above 70⁰ may be conſidered as very accurately aſcertained.</p><p>Not being altogether ſatisfied with the method employed for meaſuring the elaſticity in temperatures above that of boiling water, a better form of experiment was adopted. (Indeed it was the want of other apparatus which made it neceſſary to employ the former). A glaſs tube was procured of the form repreſented in fig. 3. having a little ciſtern L, from the top and bottom of which proceeded the ſyphons K and MN. The ciſtern contained mercury, and the tube MN was of a slender bore, and was about six feet two inches long. The end K was firmly fixed in the third hole of the lid, and the long leg of the ſyphon was furniſhed with a ſcale of inches, and firmly faſtened to an upright poſt.</p><p>The lamp was now applied at ſuch a diſtance from the veſſel as to warm it ſlowly, and make the water boil, the ſteam eſcaping for ſome time through the ſafety valve. A heavy weight was then ſuſpended on the ſteelyard ; ſuch as it was known that the veſſel would ſupport, and at the ſame time, ſuch as would not allow the ſteam to force the mercury out of the long tube. The thermometer began immediately to riſe, as alſo the mercury in the tube MN.

<p>In the memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin for 1782, there is an account of ſome experiments made by Mr Achard on the elaſtic force of ſteam, from the temperature 32⁰ to 212 . They agree extremely well with thoſe mentioned here, rarely differing more than two or three tenths of an inch. He alſo examined the elaſticity of the vapour produced from alcohol, and found, that when the elaſticity was equal to that of the vapour of water, the temperature was about 35⁰lower. Thus, when the elaſticity oſ both was measured by 28,1 inches of mercury, the temperature of the watery vapour was 209⁰, and that of the ſpirituous vapour was 173⁰∙ When the elaſticity was 18,5, the temperature of the water was 189,5, and that of the alcohol 154,6. When the elaſticity was 11,05, the water was 168⁰, and the alcohol 134⁰,4. Obſerving the difference between the temperatures of equally elaſtic vapours of water and alcohol not to be constant, but gradually to diminiſh, in Mr Achard’s experiments, along with the elaſticity, it became interesting to diſcover whether and at what temperature this difference would vaniſh altogether. Experiments were accordingly made by the writer of this article, similar to thoſe made with water. They were not made with the ſame ſcrupulous care, nor repeated as they deſerved, but they furnished rather an unexpected result. The following table will give the reader a diſtinct notion of them:</p><table> <row> <cell><p>Temp.</p><p>328</p></cell> <cell><p>Elast.</p><p>0,0</p></cell> </row> <row> <cell>40</cell> <cell>0,1</cell> </row> <row> <cell>60</cell> <cell>0,8</cell> </row> <row> <cell>80</cell> <cell>c,8</cell> </row> <row> <cell>100</cell> <cell>3’9</cell> </row> <row> <cell>120</cell> <cell>6,9</cell> </row> <row> <cell>140</cell> <cell>12,2</cell> </row> <row> <cell>160</cell> <cell>21,3</cell> </row> <row> <cell>I 80</cell> <cell>34,</cell> </row> <row> <cell>200</cell> <cell>52,4</cell> </row> <row> <cell><p>220</p><p>24.0</p></cell> <cell><p>78,5</p><p>115,</p></cell> </row> </table><p>Temp.</p><p>328</p><p>Elast.</p><p>0,0</p><p>220</p><p>24.0</p><p>78,5</p><p>115,</p><p>We say that the reſult was unexpected ; for as the natural boiling point ſeemed by former experiments to be in all fluids about 120⁰ or more below their boiling point in the ordinary preſſure of the atmoſphere, it was reaſonable to expect that the temperature at which they ceaſed to emit ſenſibly elaſtic ſteam would have ſome relation to their temperatures when emitting ſteam of any determinate elaſticity. Now as the vapour of alcohol of elaſticity 30 has its temperature about 36⁰ lower than the temperature of water equally elaſtic, it was to be expected that the temperature at which it ceaſed to be ſenſibly affected would be ſeveral degrees lower than 32⁰. It is evident, however, that this is not the caſe. But this is a point that deferves more attention, becauſe it is cloſely connected with the chemical relation between the element (if ſuch there be) of fire and the bodies into whoſe compoſition it ſeems to enter as a conſtituent part. What is the temperature 32⁰, to make it peculiarly connected with elaſticity ? It is a temperature affirmed by us for our own conveniency, on account of the familiarity of water in our experiments. Æther, we know, boils in a temperature far below this, as appears from Dr Cullen’s experiments narrated in the Eſſays Phyſical and Literary of Edinburgh. On the faith of former experiments, we may be pretty certain that it will boil in vacuo at the tem- perature—14⁰, becauſe in the air it boils at +106⁰. Therefore we may be certain, that the ſteam or vapour of aether, when of the temperature 32⁰, will be very ſenſibly elaſtic. Indeed Mr Lavoiſier ſays, that it it be expoſed in an exhauſted receiver in winter, its vapour will ſupport mercury at the height of 10 inches. A ſeries of experiments on this vapour ſimilar to the above would be very inſtructive. We even with that those on alcohol were more carefully repeated. If we draw a curve line, of which the absciſſa is the line oſ temperatures, and the ordinates are the correſponding heights of the mercury in theſe experiments on water and alcohol, we ſhall obſerve, that although they both ſenſibly coincide at 32⁰, and have the abſcissa for their common tangent, a very ſmall error of obſervation may be the cauſe of this, and the curve which expreſſes the elaſticity of ſpirituous vapour may really interſect the other, and go backwards conſiderably beyond 32⁰.</p><p>This range of experiments gives rise to ſome curious and important reflections. We now ſee that no particular temperature is necessary for water assuming the form of permanently elaſtic vapour ; and that it is highly probable that it affirmes this form even at the temperature 32⁰ ; only its elaſticity is too ſmall to afford us any ſenſible meaſure. It is well known that even ice evaporates (ſee experiments to this purpoſe by Mr Wilſon in the Philosophical Tranſactions<note anchored="false" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Vol. lxx.</p></note>, when a piece of poliſhed metal covered with hoar froſt became perfectly clear by expoſing it to a dry froſty wind).</p><p>Even mercury evaporates, or is converted into elaſtic vapour, when all external preſſure is removed. The dim film which may frequently be obſerved in the upper part of a barometer which ſtands near a ſtream of air, is found to be ſmall globules of mercury ſticking to the inside of the tube. They may be ſeen by the help of a magnifying glaſs, and are the beſt teſt of a well made barometer. They will be entirely removed by causing the mercury to rise along the tube. It will lick them all up. They conſiſt of mercury which had evaporated in the void ſpace, and was afterwards condenſed by the cold glaſs. But the elaſticity is too ſmall to occaſion a ſenſible depreſſion of the column, even when conſiderably warmed by a candle.</p><p>Many philoſophers accordingly imagine, that ſpontaneous evaporation in low temperatures is produced in this way. But we cannot be of this opinion, and muſt ſtill think that this kind of evaporation is produced by the diſſolving power of the air. When moiſt air is suddenly rarefied, there is always a precipitation of water. This is moſt diſtinctly ſeen when we work an air-pump briſkly. A miſt is produced, which we ſee plainly fall to the bottom of the receiver. But by this new doctrine the very contrary ſhould happen, becauſe the tendency of water to appear in the elaſtic form is promoted by removing the external pressure ; and we really imagine that more of it now actually becomes simple elaſtic watery vapour. But the miſt or precipitation ſhows incontrovertibly, that there had been a previous ſolution. Solution is performed by forces which act in the way of attraction ; or, to expreſs it more ſafely, ſolutions are accompanied by the mutual approaches of the particles of the menſtruum and ſolvend : all ſuch tendencies are <hi rend="italic">obſerved</hi> to increaſe by a diminution of diſtance. Hence it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> follow, that air of double denſity will diſſolve more than twice as much water. Therefore when we ſuddenly rarefy ſaturated air (even tho’<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0747.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0741"/>
its heat ſhould not diminiſh) ſome water muſt be let go. What may be its quantity we know not ; but it <hi rend="italic">may be more</hi> than what would now become elaſtic by this diminution of surrounding preſſure ; and it is not unlikely but this may have ſome effect in producing the veſicles which we found ſo difficult to explain. Theſe may be filled with pure watery vapour, and be floating in a fluid compoſed of water diſſolved in air. An experiment of Fontana’s ſeems to put this matter out or doubt. A distilling apparatus AB (fig. 4.) was ſo contrived, that the heat was applied above the ſurface of the water in the alembic A. This was done by incloſing it in another veſſel CC, filled with hot water. In the receiver B there was a sort of barometer D, with an open ciſtern, in order to ſee what preſſure there was on the ſurface of the fluid. While the receiver and alembic contained air, the heat applied at A produced no ſenſible diſtillation during ſeveral hours : But on opening a cock E in the receiver at its bottom, and making the water in the alembic to boil, steam was produced which ſoon expelled all the air, and followed it through the cock. The cock was now ſhut, and the whole allowed to grow cold by removing the fire, and applying cold water to the alembic. The barometer fell to a level nearly. Then warm water was allowed to get into the outer veſſel CC. The barometer roſe a little, and the diſtillation went on brilkly without the ſmalleſt ebullition in the alembic. The concluſion is obvious : while there was air in the receiver and communicating pipe, the diſtillation proceeded entirely by the diſſolving power of this air. Above the water in the alembic it was quickly ſaturated; and this ſaturation proceeded slowly along the ſtill air in the communicating pipe, and at laſt might take place thro’ the whole of the receiver. The ſides of the receiver being kept cold, ſhould condenſe part of the water diſſolved in the air in contact with them, and this ſhould trickle down the ſides and be collected. But any perlon who has obſerved how long a cryſtal of blue vitriol will lie at the bottom of a glaſs of ſtill water before the tinge will reach the ſurface, will ſee that it muſt be next to impoſſible for diſtillation to go on in theſe circumſtances ; and accordingly none was obſerved. But when the upper part of the apparatus was filled with pure watery vapour, it was ſupplied from the alembic as faſt as it was condenſed in the receiver, juſt as in the pulſe glaſs.</p><p>Another inference which may be drawn from theſe experiments is, that Nature ſeems to affect a certain law in the dilatation of aeriform fluids by heat. They ſeem to be dilatable nearly in proportion of their preſent dilatation. For if we ſuppoſe that the vapours reſemble air, in having their elaſticity in any given temperature proportional to their denſity, we muſt ſuppoſe that if steam of the elasticity 60, that is, ſupporting 60 inches of mercury, were ſubjected to a preſſure of 30 inches, it would expand into twice its preſent bulk. The augmentation of elaſticity therefore is the meaſure of the bulk into which it would expand in order to acquire its former elaſticity. Taking the increaſe of elaſticity therefore as a meaſure of the bulk into which it would expand under one conſtant preſſure, we ſee that equal increments of temperature produce neatly equal multiplications of bulk. Thus if a certain diminution of temperature diminiſhes its bulk ¼th, another equal dimmution of temperature will diminiſh this new bulk <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> th very nearly. Thus in our experiments, the temperatures 110⁰, 140⁰ 170⁰, 200⁰, 230 , are in arithmetical progreſſion, having equal differences ; and we ſee that the correſponding elaſticities 2,25, 5,15, 11,05, 22,62, 44,7, are very neatly in the continued proportion of 1 to 2. The elaſticity correſponding to the temperature 260 deviates conſiderably from this law, which would give 88 or 89 instead of 80 ; and the deviation increaſes in the higher temperatures. But ſtill we ſee that there is a conſiderable approximation to this law ; and it will frequently aſſiſt us to recollect, that whatever be the preſent temperature, an increaſe of 30 degrees doubles the elaſticity and the bulk of watery vapour.</p><table> <row> <cell cols="5">That 4⁰ will increaſe the elaſticity from 1 to 1⅒</cell> </row> <row> <cell>8</cell> <cell>-</cell> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1⅕</cell> </row> <row> <cell>10</cell> <cell/> <cell>1</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1¼</cell> </row> <row> <cell>12½</cell> <cell>-</cell> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1⅓</cell> </row> <row> <cell>18</cell> <cell>-</cell> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1½</cell> </row> <row> <cell>22</cell> <cell/> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1⅔</cell> </row> <row> <cell>24</cell> <cell>-</cell> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1¾</cell> </row> <row> <cell>26</cell> <cell>-</cell> <cell>I</cell> <cell>to</cell> <cell>1⅘</cell> </row> </table><p>This is ſufficiently exact for moſt practical purpoſes. Thus an engineer finds that the injection cools the cylinder of a steam-engine to 192⁰. It therefore leaves a steam whole elaſticity is <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of its full elaſticity, = 18 inches &lt;£. But it is better at all times to have recourſe to the table. Observe, too, that in the lower temperatures, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> below 110⁰, this increment of temperature does more than double the elaſticity.</p><p>This law obtains more remarkably in the incoercible vapours ; ſuch as vital air, atmoſpheric air, fixed air, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> all of which have also their elaſticity proportional to their bulk inverſely : and perhaps the deviation from the law in steams is connected with their chemical difference of conſtitution. If the bulk were always augmented in the same proportion by equal augmentations of temperature, the elaſticities would be accurately represented by the ordinates of a logarithmic curve, of which the temperatures are the correſponding absciſſae : and we might contrive such a ſcale for our thermometer, that the temperatures would be the common logarithms of the elasticities, or of the bulks having equal elaſticity ; or, with our preſent ſcale, we may find ſuch a multiplier <hi rend="italic">m for</hi> the number <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of degrees of our thermometer (above that temperature where the elaſticity is equal to unity), that this multiple ſhall be the common logarithm of the elaſticity <hi rend="italic">y</hi>; ſo that <hi rend="italic">m x</hi> = log.y.</p><p>But our experiments are not ſufficiently accurate for determining the temperature where the elaſticity is measured by 1 inch ; becauſe in theſe temperatures the elaſticities vary by exceedingly ſmall quantities. But if we take 11,04 for the unit of elaſticity, and number our temperature from 170⁰, and make <hi rend="italic">m</hi> = 0,010035, we ſhall find the product <hi rend="italic">m x</hi> to be very nearly the logarithm of the elaſticity. The deviations, however, from this law, are too great to make this equation of any uſe. But it is very practicable to frame an equation which ſhall correſpond with the experiments to any degree of accuracy ; and it has been done for air in a translation of General Roy’s Meaſurement of the Baſe at Hounſlow Heath into French by Mr Prony. It is as follows ; Let x be the degrees of Reaumur’s<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0748.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0742"/>
thermometer; let y be the expanſion of 10,000 parts of air ; let <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be = to, <hi rend="italic">m = 2,7976, n =</hi> 0,01768 : then <hi rend="italic">y = e m + nx - 627,5.</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">e</hi> being ≡≡ 10, it is plain that <hi rend="italic">e</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> <hi rend="italic">+</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> is the number, of which <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + <hi rend="italic">n x</hi> is the common logarithm. This formula is very exact as far as the temperature 6o⁰: but beyond this it needs a correction ; becauſe air, like the vapour of water, does not expand in the exact proportion of its bulk.</p><p>We obſerve this law conſiderably approximated to in the augmentation of the bulk or elasticity of elaſtic vapours ; that is, it is a fact that a given increment of temperature makes very nearly the ſame proportional augmentation of bulk and elasticity. This gives us ſome notion of the manner in which the ſuppoſed expanding cauſe produces the effect. When vapour of the bulk 4 is expanded into a bulk 5 by an addition of 10 degrees of ſensible heat, a certain quantity of fire goes into it, and is accumulated round each particle, in ſuch a manner that the temperature of each, which formerly was m <hi rend="italic">,</hi> is now m+10. Let it now receive another equal augmentation of temperature. This is now m+2c, and the bulk is — or 6¼, and the arithmetical increaſe of bulk is 1¼. The abſolute quantity of fire which has entered it is greater than the former, both on account of the greater augmentation of ſpace and the greater temperature. Consequently if this vapour be compreſsed into the bulk 5, there muſt be heat or fire in it which is not neceſſary for the temperature <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 20, far leſs for the temperature m + 10. It muſt therefore emerge, and be diſpoſed to enter a thermometer which has already the temperature <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 20: that is, the vapour muſt grow hotter by compression ; not by ſqueezing out the heat, like water out of a ſponge, but becauſe the law of attraction for heat is deranged. It would be a very valuable acquiſition to our knowledge to learn with precision the quantity of ſensible heat produced in this way; but no ſatisfactory experiments have yet been made. Μ. Lavoisier, with his chemical friends and colleagues, were buſily employed in this inquiry ; but the wickedneſs of their countrymen has deprived the world of this and many other important additions which we might have expected from this celebrated and unfortunate philoſopher. He had made, in conjunction with M. de la Place, a numerous train of accurate and expenſive experiments for meaſuring the quantity of latent or combined heat in elaſtic vapours. This is evidently a very important point to the diſtiller and practical chemiſt. This heat muſt all come from the fuel ; and it is greatly worth while to know whether any ſaving may be made of this article. Thus we know that diſtillation will go on either under the preſſure of the air, or in an alembic and receiver from which the air has been expelled by ſteam ; and we know that this laſt may be conducted in a very low temperature, even not exceeding that of the human body. But it is uncertain whether this may not employ even a greater quantity of fuel, as well as occaſion a great expence of time. We are diſpoſed to think, that when there is no air in the apparatus, and when the condenſation can be ſpeedily performed, the proportion oſ fuel expended to the fluid which comes over will diminish continually as the heat, and conſequently the density of the fleam, is augmented ; becauſe in this cafe the quantity of combined heat muſt be leſs. In the mean time, we earneſtly recommend the trial of this mode of distillation in veſſels cleared of air. It is undoubtedly of great advantage to be able to work with ſmaller fires; and it would ſecure us againſt all accidents of blowing off the head of the still, often attended with terrible conſequences<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> We earneſtly recommend this ſubject to the conſideration of the philoſopher. The laws which regulate the formation of elaſtic vapour, or the general phenomena which it exhibits, give us that link which connects chemiſtry with mechanical philoſophy. Here we ſee chemical affinities and mechanical forces ſet in immediate opposition to each other, and the one made the indication, characteriſtic, and meaſure of the other. We have not the leaſt doubt that they make but one ſcience, the Science of Univerſal Mechanics; nor do we deſpair of feeing the phenomena of ſolution, precipitation, cryſtallization, fermentation, nay animal and vegetable ſecretion and aſſimilation, succeſsfully investigated, as cases of local motion, and explained by the agency of central forces. Some thing of this kind, and that not inconsiderable, was done when Dr Cullen firſt showed how the double affinities might be illustrated by the assistance of numbers. Dr Black gave to this hint (for it was little more) that elegant preciſion which characterizes all his views. Mr Kirwan has greatly promoted this study by his numerous and ingenious examples of its application ; and the moſt valuable paſſages of the writings of Mr Lavoiſier, are thoſe where he traces with logical preciſion the balancings of force which appear in the chemical phenomena. It is from the ſimilar balancings and conſequent meaſurements, which may be obſerved and obtained in the preſent cafe, that we are to hope for admiſſion into this almoſt unbounded ſcience of contemplation. We have another link equally interesting and promiſing, viz. the production of heat by friction. This alſo highly deferves the conſideration of the mathematical philoſopher.</p></note> (B).</p><p>We muſt not conclude this article without taking notice of ſome natural phenomena which ſeem to owe their origin to the action of elaſtic fleam.</p><p>We have already taken notice of the reſemblance of the tremor and ſuccuſſions obſerved in the ſhocks of many earthquakes to thoſe which may be felt in a veſſel where water is made to boil internally, while the breaking out of the ebullition is ſtifled by the cold of the upper parts ; and we have likewiſe ſtated the objections which are uſually made to this theory of earthquakes. We may perhaps reſume the ſubject under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Volcano</hi>; but in the mean time we do not hesitate to ſay, that the wonderful appearances of the Geyzer spring in Iceland (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Huer</hi>; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Iceland,</hi> n⁰3—5.) are undoubtedly produced by the expanſion of ſteam in ignited caverns. Of theſe appearances we ſuppoſe the whole train to be produced as follows.</p><p>A cavern may be ſuppoſed of a ſhape analogous to CBDEF (fig. 5.), having a perpendicular funnel AB iſſuing from a depreſſed part of the roof. The part F may be lower than the rest, remote, and red-hot. Such places we know to be frequent <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Iceland. Water may be continually trickling into the part CD. It will fill it up to B, and even up to E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and then trickle ſlowly along into F. As ſoon as any gets into contact with an ignited part, it expands into elaſtic steam, and is partly condenſed by the cold sides of the cavern, which it gradually warms, till it condenſes no more. This<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0749.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0743"/>
production of ſteam hinders not in the ſmalleſt degree the trickling of more water into F, and the continual production of more ſteam. This now preſſes on the ſurface of the water in CD, and cauſes it to rile gradually in the funnel BA ; but slowly, becauſe its cold ſurface is condenſing an immenſe quantity of ſteam. We may eaſily ſuppoſe that the water trickles faſter into F than it is expended in the production of ſteam; ſo that it reaches farther into the ignited part, and may even fall in a ſtream into ſome deeper pit highly ignited. It will now produce ſteam in vaſt abundance, and of prodigious elaſticity; and at once puſh up the water thro’ the funnel in a ſolid jet, and to a great height. This muſt continue till the ſurface of the water sinks to BD. If the lower end of the funnel have any inequalities or notches, as is moſt likely, the ſteam will get admiſſion along with the water, which in this particular place is boiling hot, being ſuperficial, and will get to the mouth of the funnel, while water is ſtill preſſed in below. At laſt the ſteam gets in at B on all ſides ; and as it is converging to B, along the ſurface of the water, with prodigious velocity it ſweeps along with it much water, and blows it up through the funnel with great force. When this is over, the remaining ſteam blows out unmixed with water, growing weaker as it is expended, till the bottom of the funnel is again ſtopped by the water increaſing in the cavern CBD. All the phenomena above ground are perfectly conformable to the neceſſary conſequences of this very probable conſtruction of the cavern. The feeling of being lifted up, immediately before the jet, in all probability is owing to a real heaving up of the whole roof of the cavern by the firſt expanſion of the great body of ſteam. We had an accurate deſcription of the phenomena from perſons well qualified to judge of theſe matters who viſited theſe celebrated springs in 1789.</p><p><hi rend="italic">STEAM-Engine,</hi> is the name of a machine which derives its moving power ſrom the elaſticity and conden- ſibility of the fleam of boiling water. It is the moſt valuable preſent which the arts of life have ever received from the philoſopher. The mariner’s compaſs, the te- leſcope, gunpowder, and other moſt uſeful ſervants to human weakneſs and ingenuity, were the productions of chance, and we do not exactly know to whom we are indebted for them ; but the ſteam-engine was, in the very beginning, the reſult of reflection, and the production of a very ingenious mind ; and every improvement it has received, and every alteration in its conſtruction and principles, were alſo the reſults of philoſophical study.</p><p>The ſteam-engine was beyond all doubt invented by the marquis of Worceſter during the reign of Cha. II. This nobleman publiſhed in 1663 a small book intitled A <hi rend="smallcaps">Century of Inventions</hi>; giving ſome obſcure and enigmatical account of an hundred diſcoveries or contrivances of his own, which he extols as of great importance to the public. He appears to have been a perſon of much knowledge and great ingenuity : but his deſeription or accounts of theſe inventions ſeem not so much intended to inſtruct the public, as to raiſe wonder ; and his encomiums on their utility and importance are to a great degree extravagant, reſembling more the puff of an advertising tradeſman than the patriotic communications <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a gentleman. The marquis of Worceſter was indeed a projector, and very importunate and myſterious withal in his applications for public encouragement. His account, however, of the ſteam-engine, although by no means fit to give us any diſtinct notions of its ſtructure and operation, is exact as far as it goes, agreeing preciſely with what we now know of the ſubject. It is N⁰ 68. of his inventions. His words are as follow : “ This admirable method which I propoſe of raiſing water by the force of fire has no bounds if the veſſels be ſtrong enough : for I have taken a cannon, and having filled it ¾ths full of water, and ſhut up its muzzle and touch-hole, and expoſed it to the fire for 24 hours, it burſt with a great exploſion. Having afterwards diſcovered a method of fortifying veſſels internally, and combined them in ſuch a way that they filled and acted alternately, I have made the water ſpout in an uninterrupted ſtream 40 feet high; and one veſſel of rarefied water raiſed 40 of cold water. The perſon who conducted the operation had nothing to do but turn two cocks ; ſo that one veſſel of water being confirmed, another begins to force, and then to fill itſelf with cold water, and ſo on in ſucceſſion.”</p><p>It does not appear that the noble inventor could ever intereſt the public by theſe accounts. His character as a projector, and the many failures which perſons of this turn of mind daily experience, probably prejudiced peo- ple againſt him, and prevented all attention to his projects. It was not till towards the end of the century, when experimental philoſophy was proſecuted all over Europe with uncommon ardour, that theſe notions again engaged attention. Captain Savary, a perſon alſo of great ingenuity and ardent mind, ſaw the reality and practicability of the marquis of Worceſter's project. He knew the great expanſive power of ſteam, and had dilcovered the inconceivable rapidity with which it is reconverted into water by cold ; and he ſoon contrived a machine for raiſing water, in which both' of theſe properties were employed. He ſays, that it was entirely his own invention. Dr Deſaguliers inſiſts that he only copied the marquis’s invention, and charges him with groſs plagiariſm, and with having bought up and burned the copies of the marquis’s book, in order to ſecure the honour of the diſcovery to himſelf. Thia is a very grievous charge, and ſhould have been ſubſtantiated by very diſtinct evidence. Deſaguliers produces none ſuch ; and he was much too late to know what happened at that time. The argument which he gives is a very fooliſh one, and gave him no title to conſider Savaryſe experiment as a falſehood ; for it might have happened preciſely as Savary relates, and not as it happened to Defaguilſers. The fact is, that Savary obtained his patent of invention after a hearing of objections, among which the diſcovery of the marquis of Worceſter was not mentioned : and it is certain that the account given in the Century of Inventions could inſtruct no perſon who was not sufficiently acquainted’ with the properties of ſteam to be able to invent the machine himſelf.</p><p>Captain Savary obtained his patent after <hi rend="italic">having actually erected</hi> ſeveral machines, of which he gave a deſcription in a book intitled <hi rend="smallcaps">The Miner’s· Friend,</hi> publiſhed in 1696, and in another work publiſhed in 1099. Much about this time Dr Papin, a Frenchman and fellow of the Royal Society, invented a method of diſſolving bones and other animal ſolids in water, by confining<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0750.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0744"/>
them in cloſe vessels, which he called <hi rend="smallcaps">digesters,</hi> ſo as to acquire a great degree of heat. For it must be obſerved in this place, that it had been diſcovered long before (in 1684) by Dr Hooke, the moſt inquiſitive experimental philosopher of that inquiſitive age, that water could not be made to acquire above a certain temperature in the open air ; and that as ſoon as it begins to boil, its temperature remains fixed, and an increaſe of heat only produces a more violent ebullition, and a more rapid waste. But Papin’s experiments made the elaſtic power of ſteam very familiar to him : and when he left England and settled as profeſſor of mathematics at Marpurgh, he made many awkward attempts to employ this force in mechanics, and even for raising water. It appears that he had made experiments with this view in 1698, by order of Charles Landgrave of Heſſe. For this reaſon the French affect to consider him as the inventor of the ſteam-engine. He indeed publiſhed ſome account of his invention in 1707; but he acknowledges that Captain Savary had alſo, and without any communication with him, invented the ſame thing. Whoever will take the trouble of looking at the deſcription which he has given of theſe inventions, which are to be ſeen in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum, Lipsiae,</hi> and in Leupold’s <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarum,</hi> will see that they are most awkward, abſurd, and impracticable. His conceptions of natural operations were always vague and imperfect, and he was neither philoſopher nor mechanician.</p><p>We are thus anxious about the claim of thoſe gentlemen, becauſe a moſt reſpectable French author, Mr Boſſut, ſays in his <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamique,</hi> that the firſt notion of the ſteam-engine was <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> owing to Dr Papin, who had not only invented the digester, but had in 1695 published a little performance deſcribing a machine for railing water, in which the piſtons are moved by the vapour of boiling water alternately dilated and condenſed. Now the fact is that Papin’s firſt publication was in 1707, and his piſton is nothing more than a floater on the ſurface of the water, to prevent the watte of ſteam by condenſation ; and the return of the piſton is not produced, as in the ſteam-engine, by the condenſation of the ſteam, but by admitting the air and a column of water to press it back into its place. The whole contrivance is ſo awkward, and ſo unlike any diſtinct notions of the ſubject, that it cannot do credit to any perſon. We may add, that much about the ſame time Mr Amontons contrived a very ingenious but intricate machine, which he called a <hi rend="italic">fire-wheel.</hi> It conſiſted of a number of buckets placed in the circumference of a wheel, and communicating with each other by very intricate circuitous passages. One part of this circumference was expoſed to the heat of a furnace, and another to a ſtream or cittern of cold water. The communications were ſo diſpoſed, that the ſteam produced in the buckets on one side of the wheel drove the water into buckets on the other side, ſo that one side of the wheel was always much heavier than the other ; and it must, therefore turn round, and may execute ſome work. The death of the inventor, and the intricacy oſ the machine, cauſed it to be neglected. Another member of the Parisian academy of ſciences (Mr Deſlandes) alſo preſented to the academy a project of a ſteam-wheel, where the impulſive force of the vapour was employed; but it met with no encouragement. The Engliſh engineers had by this time ſo much improved Savary’s firſt invention, that it supplanted all others. We have therefore no heſitation in giving the honour of the firſt and complete invention to the marquis of Worceſter ; and we are not diſpoſed to refuse Captain Savary’s claim to originality as the construction of the machine, and even think it probable that his own experiments made him ſee the whole independent of the marquis’s account.</p><p>Captain Savary’s engine, as improved and simplified by himſelf, is as follows.</p><p>A (fig. 6.) repreſents a ſtrong copper boiler properly built up in a furnace. There proceeds from its top a large ſteam-pipe B, which enters into the top of another ſtrong veſſel R called the <hi rend="smallcaps">receiver.</hi> This pipe has a cock at C called the <hi rend="smallcaps">steam-cock.</hi> In the bottom of the receiver is a pipe F, which communicates ſidewiſe with the rising pipe KGH. The lower end H of this pipe is immerſed in the water of the pit or well, and its upper part K opens into the cittern into which the water is to be delivered. Immediately below the pipe of communication F there is a valve G, opening when preſſed from below, and ſhutting when preſſed downwards. A ſimilar valve is placed at I, immediately above the pipe of communication. Laſtly, there is a pipe ED which branches off from the rising pipe, and enters into the top of the receiver. This pipe has a cock D called the <hi rend="smallcaps">injection-cock.</hi> The mouth of the pipe ED has a nozzle f pierced with ſmall holes, pointing from a centre in every direction. The keys of the two cocks C and D are united, and the handle <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">regulator.</hi></p><p>Let the regulator be ſo placed that the ſteam-cock C is open and the injection-cock D is ſhut ; put water into the boiler A, and make it boil ſtrongly. The ſteam coming from it will enter the receiver, and gradually warm it, much ſteam being condenſed in producing this effect. When it has been warmed ſo as to condenſe no more, the ſteam proceeds into the rising pipe ; the valve G remains ſhut by its weight ; the ſteam lifts the valve I, and gets into the rising pipe, and gradually warms it. When the workman feels this to be the caſe, or hears the rattling of the valve I, he immediately turns the ſteam-cock ſo as to ſhut it, the injection-cock ſtill remaining ſhut (at leaſt we may ſuppoſe this for the preſent). The apparatus must now cool, and the ſteam in the receiver collapſes into water. There is nothing now to balance the preſſure of the atmoſphere ; the valve I remains ſhut by its weight ; but the air incumbent on the water in the pit preſſes up this water through the ſuction-pipe H G, and cauſes it to lift the valve G, and flow into the receiver R, and fill it to the top, if not more than 20 or 25 feet above the ſurface of the pit water.</p><p>The ſteam-cock is now opened. The ſteam which, during the cooling of the receiver, has been accumulating in the boiler, and acquiring a great elasticity by the action of the fire, now ruſhes in with great violence, and, preſſing on the ſurface of the water in the receiver, cauſes it to ſhut the valve G and open the valve I by its weight alone, and it now flows into the rising pipe, and would stand on a level if the elaſticity of the ſteam were no more than what would balance the atmoſpherical preſſure. But it is much more than this, and therefore is <hi rend="italic">presses</hi> the water out of the receiver into the rising<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0751.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0745"/>
pipe, and will even cauſe it to come out at K, if the elaſticity of the steam is ſufficiently great. In order to enſure this, the boiler has another pipe in its top, covered with a safety-valve V, which is kept down by a weight W ſuſpended on a steelyard L Μ. This weight is ſo adjusted that its preſſure on the ſafety-valve is ſome- what greater than the preſſure of a column of water <hi rend="italic">N k</hi> as high as the point of diſcharge K. The fire is ſo regulated that the ſteam is always issuing a little by the loaded valve V. The workman keeps the ſteam- valve open till he hears the valve I rattle. This tells him that the water is all forced out of the receiver, and that the ſteam is now following it. He immediately turns the regulator which ſhuts the ſteam-cock, and now, for the first time, opens the injection-cock. The cold water trickles at first through the holes of the nozzle <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and falling down through the ſteam, begins to condenſe it ; and then its elaſticity being leſs than the preſſure of the water in the pipe KEDf, the cold water ſpouts in all directions through the nozzle, and, quick as thought, produces a complete condenſation. The valve G now opens again by the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the water of the pit, and the receiver is ſoon filled with cold water. The injection-cock is now ſhut, and the ſteam-cock opened, and the whole operation is now repeated ; and ſo on continually.</p><p>This is the ſimple account of the proceſs, and will ſerve to give the reader an introductory notion of the operation ; but a more minute attention muſt be paid to many particulars before we can ſee the properties and defects of this ingenious machine.</p><p>The water is driven along the riſing pipe by the elaſticity of the ſteam. This muſt in the boiler, and every part of the machine, exert a preſſure on every ſquare inch of the veſſels equal to that of the upright column of water. Suppoſe the water to be raiſed 100 feet, about 25 of this may be done in the ſuction-pipe ; that is, the upper part of the receiver may be about 25 feet above the ſurface of the pit-water. The remaining 75 muſt be done by forcing, and every ſquare inch of the boiler will be ſqueezed out by a preſſure of more than 30 pounds. This very moderate height therefore requires very ſtrong veſſels ; and the Marquis of Worceſter was well aware of the danger of their burſting. A copper boiler of six feet diameter muſt be <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths of an inch thick to be juſt in equilibrio with this preſſure : and the ſoldered joint will not be able to withstand it, eſpecially in the high temperature to which the water muſt be heated in order to produce ſteam of ſufficient elaſticity. By conſulting the table of the elaſticity of ſteam deduced from our experiments mentioned in the preceding article, we ſee that this temperature muſt be at leaſt 280⁰ of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. In this heat ſoft ſolder is juſt ready to melt, and has no tenacity ; even ſpelter ſolder is conſiderably weakened by it. Accordingly, in a machine erected by Captain Savary at York Buildings in London, the workman having loaded the ſafety-valve a little more than uſual to make the engine work more briſkly, the boiler burſt with a dreadful exploſion, and blew up the furnace and adjoining parts of the building as if it had been gunpowder. Mr Savary ſucceeded pretty well in raising moderate quantities of water to ſmall heights, but could make nothing of deep mines. Many attempts were made, on the Marquis’s principle, to</p><p>ſtrengthen the veſſels from within by radiated bars and by hoops, but in vain. Very ſmall boilers or evaporators were then tried, kept red-hot, or nearly ſo, and ſupplied with a ſlender ſtream of water trickling into them ; but this afforded no opportunity of making a collection of ſteam during the refrigeration of the receiver, ſo as to have a magazine of ſteam in readiness for the next forcing operation ; and the working of ſuch machines was always an employment of great danger and anxiety.</p><p>The only ſituation in which this machine could be employed with perfect ſafety, and with ſome effect, was where the whole lift did not exceed 30 or 35 feet. In this caſe the greateſt part of it was performed by the ſuction-pipe, and a very manageable preſſure was ſufficient for the rest. Several machines of this kind were erected in England about the beginning of this century. A very large one was erected at a ſalt-work in the ſouth of France. Here the water was to be raiſed no more than 18 feet. The receiver was capacious, and it was occaſionally ſupplied with ſteam from a ſmall ſalt-pan conſtructed on purpoſe with a cover. The entry of the ſteam into the receiver merely allowed the water to run out of it by a large valve, which was opened by the hand, and the condenſation was produced by the help of a ſmall forcing pump alſo worked by the hand. In ſo particular a ſituation as this ( and many ſuch may occur in the endleſs variety of human wants), this is a very powerful engine ; and having few moving and rubbing parts, it muſt be of great durability. This circumſtance has occaſioned much attention to be given to this first form of the engine, even long after it was ſupplanted by thoſe of a much better conſtruction. A very ingenious attempt was made very lately to adapt this conſtruction to the uſes of the miners. The whole depth of the pit was divided into lifts of 15 feet, in the ſame manner as is frequently done in pump-machines. In each of theſe was a ſuction-pipe 14 feet long, having above it a ſmall receiver like R, about a foot high, and its capacity ſomewhat greater than that of the pipe. This receiver had a valve at the head of the ſuction- pipe, and another opening outwards into the little cistern, into which the next ſuction-pipe above dipped to take in water. Each of theſe receivers ſent up a pipe from its top, which all met in the cover oſ a large veſſel above ground, which was of double the capacity of all the receivers and pipes. This veſſel was cloſe on all ſides. Another veſſel of equal capacity was placed immediately above it, with a pipe from its bottom paſſing through the cover of the lower veſſel and reaching near to its bottom This upper veſſel communicates with the boiler, and conſtitutes the receiver of the ſteam-engine. The operation is as follows : The lower veſſel is full of water. Steam is admitted into the upper veſſel, which expels the air by a valve, and fills the veſſel. It is then condenſed by cold water. The preſſure of the atmoſphere would cauſe it to enter by all the ſuction-pipes of the different lifts, and press on the ſurface of the water in the lower receiver, and force it into the upper one. But becauſe each ſuction-pipe dips in a ciſtern of water, the air preſſes this water before it, raiſes it into each of the little receivers which it fills, and allows the spring of the air (which was formerly in them, but which now passes up into the lower receiver) to force the water out of the lower receiver into the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0752.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0746"/>
upper one. When this has been completed, the ſteam is again admitted into the upper receiver. This allows the water to run back into the lower receiver, and the air returns into the ſmall receivers in the pit, and allows the water to run out of each into its proper ciſtern. By this means the water of each pipe has been raiſed 15 feet. The operation may thus be repeated continually.</p><p>The contrivance is ingenious, and ſimilar to ſome which are to be met with in the hydraulics of Schottus, Sturmius, and other German writers. But the operation muſt be exceedingly slow ; and we imagine that the expence of ſteam muſt be great, becauſe it muſt fill a very large and very cold veſſel, which muſt waſte a great portion of it by condenſation. We see by ſome late publications of the very ingenious Mr Blackey, that he is ſtill attempting to maintain the reputation of this machine by ſome contrivance oſ this kind ; but we imagine that they will be ineffectual, except in ſome very particular ſituations.</p><p>For the great defect of the machine, even when we can ſecure it againſt all riſk of burſting, is the prodigious waſte of ſteam, and conſequently of fuel. Daily experience ſhows, that a few ſcattered drops of cold water is sufficient for producing an almoſt inſtantaneous condenſation of a great quantity of ſteam. Therefore when the ſteam is admitted into the receiver of Savary’s engine, and comes into contact with the cold top and cold water, it is condenſed with great rapidity ; and the water does not hin to ſubſide till its ſurface has become ſo hot that it condenſes no more ſteam. It may now begin to yield to the preſſure of the incumbent ſteam ; but as ſoon as it deſcends a little, more of the cold surface of the receiver comes into contact with the ſteam, and condenſes more of it, and the water can deſcend no farther till this addition of cold ſurface is heated up to the ſtate of evaporation. This rapid condenſation goes on all the while the water is deſeending. By ſome experiments frequently repeated by the writer of this article, it appears that no leſs than <hi rend="superscript"> 11</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> ths of the whole ſteam is uſeleſsly condenſed in this manner, and not more than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> th is employed in allowing the water to deſeend by its own weight ; and he has reaſon to think that the portion thus wasted will be conſiderably greater, if the ſteam be employed to <hi rend="italic">force</hi> the water out of the receiver to any conſiderable height.</p><p>Obſerve, too, that all this waſte muſt be repeated in every ſucceeding ſtroke ; for the whole receiver muſt be cooled again in order to fill itſelf with water.</p><p>Many attempts have been made to diminish this waſte ; but all to little purpoſe, becauſe the very filling of the receiver with cold water occaſions its ſides to condenſe a prodigious quantity of ſteam in the ſucceeding ſtroke. Mr Blackey has attempted to lessen this by uſing two receivers. In the first was oil ; and into this only the ſteam was admitted. This oil paſſed to and fro between the two receivers, and never touched the water except in a ſmall surface. But this hardly produced a ſenſible diminution of the waſte : for it muſt now be obſerved, that there is a neceſſity for the first cylinder’s being cooled to a conſiderable degree below the boiling point ; otherwiſe, though it will condenſe much ſteam, and allow the water to riſe into the receiver, there will be a great diminution of the height of ſuction, unleſs the veſſel be much cooled. This appears plainly by inspecting the table oſ elasticity. Thus, if the veſſel be cooled no lower than 180⁰, we ſhould loſe one half of the preſſure of the atmoſphere ; if cooled to 120, we ſhould ſtill loſe <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th. The inſpection of this table is of great uſe for understanding and improving this noble machine ; and without a conſtant recollection oſ the elaſticity of ſteam correſponding to its actual heat, we ſhall never have a notion oſ the niceties of its operation.</p><p>The rapidity with which the ſteam is condenſed is really aſtoniſhing. Experiments have been made on ſteam-veſſels of six feet in diameter and ſeven feet high; and it has been found, that about four ounces of water, as warm as the human blood, will produce a complete condenſation in leſs than a ſecond ; that is, will produce all the condenſation that it is capable of producing, leaving an elaſticity about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of the elaſticity of the air. In another experiment with the ſame ſteam-veſſel, no cold water was allowed to get into it, but it was made to communicate by a long pipe four inches in diameter with another veſſel immerſed in cold water. The condenſation was ſo rapid that the time could not be meaſured : it certainly did not exceed half a ſecond. Now this condenſation was performed by a very trifling ſurface of contact. Perhaps we may explain it a little in this way : When a maſs of ſteam, in immediate contact with the cold water, is condenſed, it leaves a void, into which the adjoining ſteam inſtantly expands ; and by this very expanſion its capacity for heat is increaſed, or it grows cold, that is, abſtracts the heat from the ſteam situated immediately beyond it. And in this expanſion and refrigeration it is itſelf partly condenſed or converted into water, and leaves a void, into which the circumjacent ſteam immediately expands, and produces the ſame effect on the ſteam beyond it. And thus it may happen that the abſtraction of a ſmall quantity of heat from an inconſiderable mass of ſteam may produce a condenſation which may be very extenſive. Did we know the change made in the capacity of ſteam for heat by a given change of bulk, we ſhould be able to tell exactly what would be the effect of this local actual condenſation. But experiment has not as yet given us any preciſe notions on this ſubject. We think that this rapid condenſation to a great diſtance by a very moderate actual abſtraction of heat is a proof that the capacity of ſteam for heat is prodigiouſly increaſed by expanſion. We say a <hi rend="italic">very moderate actual abstraction</hi> of heat, becauſe very little heat is neceſſary to raiſe four ounces of bloodwarm water to a boiling temperature, which will unfit it for condenſing ſteam. The remarkable phenomenon of ſnow and ice produced in the Hungarian machine, when the air condenſed in the receiver is allowed to blow through the cock (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics),</hi> ſhows this to be the caſe in moiſt air, that is, in air holding water in a ſtate of chemical ſolution. We ſee something very like it in a thunder-ſtorm. A ſmall black cloud ſometimes appears in a particular ſpot, and in a very few seconds ſpreads over many hundred acres of ſky, that is, a precipitation of water goes on with that rapid diffuſion. We imagine that this increaſe of capacity or demand for heat, and the condenſation that muſt enſue if this demand is not ſupplied, is much more remarkable ia pure watery vapours, and that this is a capital distinction of their conſtitution from vapours dissolved in air.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0753.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0747"/>
The reader muſt now be ſo well acquainted with what paſſes in the ſteam-veſſel, and with the exterior reſults from it, as readily to comprehend the propriety of the changes which we ſhall now deſcribe as having been made in the conſtruction and principle of the ſteam engine.</p><p>Of all places in England the tin-mines of Cornwall stood moſt in need of hydraulic aſſistſance; and Mr Savary was much engaged in projects for draining them by his ſteam-engine. This made its conſtruction and principles well known among the machiniſts and engineers of that neighbourhood. Among theſe were a Mr Newcomen, an iron-monger or blackſmith, and Mr Cawley a glazier at Dartmouth in Devonſhire, who had dabbled much with this machine. Newcomen was a perſon of ſome reading, and was in particular acquainted with the perſon, writings, and projects of his countryman Dr Hooke. There are to be found among Hooke’s papers, in the poſſeſſion of the Royal Society, ſome notes of obſervations, for the uſe of Newcomen his countryman, on Papin’s boaſted method of tranſmitting to a great diſtance the action of a mill by means of pipes. Papin’s project was to employ the mill to work two air- pumps of great diameter. The cylinders of theſe pumps were to communicate by means of pipes with equal cylinders furniſhed with piſtons, in the neighbourhood of a diſtant mine. Theſe piſtons were to be connected, by means of levers, with the piſton-rods of the mine. Therefore, when the piſton of the air-pump at the mill was drawn up by the mill, the correſponding piſton at the side of the mine would be preſſed down by the atmoſphere, and thus would raiſe the piſton-rod in the mine, and draw the water. It would appear from theſe notes, that Dr Hooke had diſſuaded Mr Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle, of which he had expoſed the fallacy in ſeveral diſcourſes before the Royal Society. One passage is remarkable. “ Could he (meaning Papin) make a ſpeedy vacuum under your second piſton, your work is done.”</p><p>It is highly probable that, in the courſe of this ſpeculation, it occurred to Mr Newcomen that the vacuum he ſo much wanted might be produced by ſteam, and that this gave rise to his new principle and conſtruction of the ſteam-engine. The ſpecific desideratum was in Newcomen’s mind; and therefore, when Savary’s engine appeared, and became known in his neighbourhood many years after, he would readily catch at the help which it promiſed.</p><p>Savary however claims the invention as his own ; but Switzer, who was perſonally acquainted with both, is positive that Newcomen was the inventor. By his principles (as a quaker) being averſe from contention, he was contented to ſhare the honour and the profits with Savary, whoſe acquaintance at court enabled him to procure the patent in 1705, in which all the three were aſſociated. Poſterity has done juſtice to the modeſt inventor, and the machine is univerſally called <hi rend="smallcaps">Newcomen’s Engine.</hi> Its principle and mode of operation may be clearly conceived as follows.</p><p>Let A (fig. 7.) repreſent a great boiler properly built in a furnace. At a small height above it is a cylinder CBBC of metal, bored very truly and ſmoothly. The boiler communicates with this cylinder by means of the throat or ſteam pipe NQ. The lower aperture of this pipe is ſhut by the plate N, which is ground very flat, ſo as to apply very accurately to the whole circumference of the orifice. This plate ts called the regulator or ſteam-cock, and it turns horizontally round an axis <hi rend="italic">ba</hi> which paſſes through the top of the boiler, and is nicely fitted to the ſocket, like the key of a cock, by grinding. The upper end of this axis is furniſhed with a handle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> T.</p><p>A piſton P is ſuſpended in this cylinder, and made air-tight by a packing of leather or ſoft rope, well filled with tallow ; and, for greater ſecurity, a ſmall quantity of water is kept above the piſton. The piſton-rod PD is ſuſpended by a chain which is fixed to the upper extremity F of the arched head FD of the great lever or <hi rend="smallcaps">Working Beam</hi> HK, which turns on the gudgeon O. There is a similar arched head EG at the other end oſ the beam. To its upper extremity E is fixed a chain carrying the pump-rod XL, which raiſes the water from the mine. The load on this end of the beam is made to exceed considerably the weight of the piſton P at the other extremity.</p><p>At ſome ſmall height above the top of the cylinder is a ciſtern W called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Injection Cistern.</hi> From this deſcends the <hi rend="smallcaps">Injection Pipe</hi> ZSR, which enters the cylinder through its bottom, and terminates in a ſmall hole R, or ſometimes in a nozzle pierced with many ſmaller holes diverging from a centre in all directions. This pipe has at S a cock called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Injection Cock,</hi> fitted with a handle V.</p><p>At the oppoſite side of the cylinder, a little above its bottom, there is a lateral pipe, turning upwards at the extremity, and there covered by a clack-valve f <hi rend="italic">,</hi> called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Snifting Valve,</hi> which has a little diſh round it to hold water for keeping it air-tight.</p><p>There proceeds alſo from the bottom of the cylinder a pipe <hi rend="italic">deg h</hi> (paſſing behind the boiler), of which the lower end is turned upwards, and is covered with a valve <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This part is immerſed in a ciſtern of water Y, called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hot Well,</hi> and the pipe itſelf is callcd the <hi rend="smallcaps">Eduction Pipe.</hi> Laſtly, the boiler is furniſhed with a ſafety-valve called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Puppet Clack</hi> (which is not represented in this ſketch for want of room), in the ſame manner as Savary’s engine. This valve is generally loaded with one or two pounds on the ſquare inch, ſo that it allows the ſteam to eſcape when its elaſticity is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /10th greater than that of common air. Thus all riſk of burſting the boiler is avoided, and the preſſure outwards is very moderate ; ſo alſo is the heat. For, by inſpecting the table of vaporous elaſticity, we ſee that the heat correſponding to 32 inches of elaſticity is only about 216⁰ of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p><p>Theſe are all the eſſential parts of the engine, and are here drawn in the moſt ſimple form, till our knowledge of their particular offices ſhall ſhow the propriety of the peculiar forms which are given to them. Let us now ſee how the machine is put in motion, and what is the nature of its work.</p><p>The water in the boiler being ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of ſtrong ebullition, and the ſteam iſſuing by the ſafety-valve, let us conſider the machine in a ſtate of reſt, having both the ſteam-cock and injection cock ſhut. The reſting poſition or attitude of the machine muſt be ſuch as appears in this ſketch, the pump rods preponderating, and the great piſton being drawn up to the top of the cylinder. Now open the ſteam cock by turning the handle T of the regulator. The ſteam from the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0754.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0748"/>
boiler will immediately ruſh in, and flying all over the cylinder, will mix with the air. Much of it will be condenſed by the cold ſurface of the cylinder and piſton, and the water produced from it will trickle down the ſides, and run off by the eduction-pipe. This condensation and waste of ſteam will continue till the whole cylinder and piſton are made as hot as boiling water. When this happens, the ſteam will begin to open the ſnifting valve <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and iſſue through the pipe ; ſlowly at firſt and very cloudy, being mixed with much air. The blaſt at f will grow ſtronger by degrees, and more transparent, having already carried off the greateſt part of the common air which filled the cylinder. We ſuppoſed that the water was boiling briſkly, ſo that the steam was iſſuing by the ſafety-valve which is in the top of the boiler, and through every crevice. The opening of the fteam-cock puts an end to this at once, and it has ſometimes happened that the cold cylinder abſtracts the ſteam from the boiler with ſuch aſtoniſhing rapidity, that the preſſure of the atmoſphere has burſt up the bottom of the boiler. We may here mention an accident of which we were witneſſes, which alſo ſhows the immenſe rapidity of the condenſation. The boiler was in a frail ſhed at the side of the engine-houſe ; a shoot of ſnow from the top of the houſe fell down and broke through the roof of the ſhed, and was ſcattered over the head of the boiler, which was of an oblong or oval ſhape. In an inſtant the ſides of it were ſqueezed together by the preſſure of the atmoſphere.</p><p>When the manager of the engine perceives that not only the blaſt at the ſnifting valve is ſtrong and ſteady, but that the boiler is now fully ſupplied with ſteam of a proper ſtrength, appearing by the renewal of the diſcharge at the ſaſety-valve, he ſhuts the ſteamcock, and opens the injection cock S by turning its handle V. The preſſure of the column of water in the injectionpipe ZS immediately forces ſome water through the ſpout R. This coming in contact with the pure vapour which now fills the cylinder, condenſes it, and thus makes a partial void, into which the more diſtant ſteam immediately expands, and by expanding collapſes (as has been already obſerved). What remains in the cylinder no longer balances the atmoſpherical preſſure on the ſurface of the water in the injection-ciſtern, and therefore the water ſpouts rapidly through the hole R by the joint action of the column ZS and the unbalanced preſſure of the atmoſphere ; at the ſame time the ſnifting valve <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and the eduction-valve <hi rend="italic">h</hi> are ſhut by the unbalanced preſſure of the atmoſphere. The velocity of the injection water muſt therefore rapidly increaſe, and the jet will daſh (if single) againſt the bottom of the piſton, and be ſeattered through the whole capacity of the cylinder. In a very ſhort ſpace of time, therefore, the condenſation of the ſteam becomes univerſal, and the elasticity of what remains is almoſt nothing. The whole preſſure of the atmoſphere is exerted in the upper ſurface of the piſton, while there is hardly any on its under side. Therefore, if the load on the outer end E of the working beam is inferior to this preſſure, it muſt yield to it. The piſton P muſt deſcend, and the pump piſton L muſt aſcend, bringing along with it the water of the mine, and the motion muſt continue till the great piſton reaches the bottom of the cylinder ; for it is not like the motion which would take place in a cylinder of air rarefied to the ſame degree. In this laſt case, the impelling foree would be continually diminiſhed, becauſe the capacity of the cylinder is diminiſhed by the deſcent of the piſton, and the air in it is continually becoming more denſe and elaſtic. The piſton would ſtop at a certain height, where the elaſticity of the included air, together with the load at E, would balance the atmoſpherical preſſure on the piſton. But when the contents of the cylinder are pure vapour, and the continued ſtream of injected cold water keeps down its temperature to the ſame pitch as at the beginning, the elaſticity of the remaining ſteam can never increaſe by the deſcent of the piſton, nor exceed what correſponds to this temperature. The impelling or accelerating force therefore remains the ſame, and the deſcent of the piſton will be uniformly accelerated, if there is not an increaſe of reſiſtance ariſing from the nature of the work performed by the other end of the beam. This circumſtance will come under conſideration afterwards, and we need not attend to it at preſent. It is enough for our preſent purpoſe to ſee, that if the cylinder has been completely purged of common air before the ſteam cock was ſhut, and if none has entered ſince, the piſton will deſcend to the very bottom of the cylinder. And this may be frequently obſerved in a good ſteam-engine where every part is air-tight. It sometimes happens, by the pit-pump drawing air, or ſome part of the communication between the two strains giving way, that the piſton comes down with ſuch violence as to knock out the bottom of the cylinder with the blow.</p><p>The only obſervation which remains to be made on the motion of the piſton in deſcending is, that it does not begin at the inſtant the injection is made. The piſton was kept at the top by the preponderancy of the outer end of the working beam, and it muſt remain there till the difference between the elaſticity of the ſteam below it and the preſſure of the atmoſphere exceeds this preponderancy. There muſt therefore be a ſmall ſpace of time between the beginning of the condenſation and the beginning of the motion. This is very ſmall, not exceeding the third or the fourth part of a ſecond ; but it may be very diſtinctly obſerved by an attentive ſpectator. He will ſee, that the inſtant the injection-cock is opened, the cylinder will ſenſibly riſe upwards a little by the preſſure of the air on its bottom. Its whole weight is not nearly equal to this preſſure ; and inſtead of its being neceſſary to <hi rend="italic">ſupport</hi> it by a ſtrong floor, we muſt <hi rend="italic">keep it down</hi> by ſtrong joiſts loaded by heavy walls. It is uſual to frame theſe joiſts into the ports which carry the axis of the working-beam, and are therefore loaded with the whole ſtrain of the machine. This riſing of the cylinder ſhows the inſtantaneous commencement of the condenſation ; and it is not till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> this has been diſtinctly obſerved that the piſton is ſeen to start, and begin to deſcend.</p><p>When the manager sees the piſton as low as he thinks proper, he ſhuts the injection-cock, and opens the ſteam-cock. The steam has been accumulating above the water in the boiler during the whole time of the piſton’s deſcent, and is now ruſhing violently through the puppet clack. The moment therefore that the ſteam-cock is opened, it ruſhes violently into the cylinder, having an elaſticity greater than that of the air. It therefore immediately blows open the ſnifting valve, and allows (at leaſt) the water which had come in by the former injection, and what aroſe from the conden-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0755.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0749"/>
fed steam, to deſcend by its own weight through the eduction-pipe <hi rend="italic">d e g h</hi> to open the valve <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and to run out into the hot well. And we muſt easily ſee that this water is boiling hot ; for while lying in the bottom of the cylinder, it will condenſe ſteam till it acquires this temperature, and therefore cannot run down till it condenses no more. There is ſtill a waſte of ſteam at its firſt admiſſion, in order to heat the inſide of the cylinder and the injected water to the boiling temperature : but the ſpace being ſmall, and the whole being already very warm, this is very ſoon done ; and when things are properly conſtructed, little more ſteam is wanted than what will warm the cylinder ; for the eduction-pipe receives the injection water even during the descent of the piſton, and it is therefore removed pretty much out of the way of the ſteam.</p><p>This firſt puff of the entering ſteam is of great ſervice : it drives out of the cylinder the vapour which it finds there. This is ſeldom pure watery vapour : all water contains a quantity of air in a ſtate of chemical union. The union is but feeble, and a boiling heat is sufficient for diſengaging the greateſt part oſ it by increaſing its elaſticity. It may alſo be diſengaged by ſimply removing the external pressure of the atmoſphere. This is clearly ſeen when we expoſe a glaſs of water in an exhauſted receiver. Therefore the ſmall ſpace below the piſton contains watery vapour mixed with all the air which had been diſengaged from the water in the boiler by ebullition, and all that was separated from the injection water by the diminution of external pressures. All this is blown out of the cylinder by the firſt puff of ſteam. We may obſerve in this place, that waters differ exceedingly in the quantity of air which they hold in a ſtate of ſolution. All ſpring water contains much of it : and water newly brought up from deep mines contains a great deal more, becauſe the ſolution was aided in theſe ſituations by great preſſures. Such waters ſparkle when poured into a glaſs. It is therefore of great conſequence to the good performance of a ſteam-engine to uſe water containing little air, both in the boiler and in the injection-ciſtern. The water of running brooks is preferable to all others, and the freer it is from any ſaline impregnation it generally contains leſs air. Such engines as are ſo unfortunately situated that they are obliged to employ the very water which they have brought up from great depths, are found greatly inferior in their performance to others. The air collected below the piſton greatly diminiſhes the accelerating force, and the expulsion of ſuch a quantity requires a long continued blaſt of the beſt ſteam at the beginning of every ſtroke. It is adviſable to keep ſuch water in a large ſhallow pond for a long while before uſing it.</p><p>Let us now consider the state of the piſton. It is evident that it will ſtart or begin to riſe the moment the ſteam-cock is opened ; for at that inſtant the excels of atmoſpherical pressure, by which it was kept down in opposition to the preponderancy of the outer end of the beam, is diminiſhed. The piſton is therefore <hi rend="italic">dragged</hi> upwards, and it will riſe even although the ſteam which is admitted be not ſo elaſtic as common air. Suppoſe the mercury in the barometer to ſtand at 30 inches, and that the preponderancy at the outer end of the beam is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> th of the pressure of the air on the piſton, the piſton will not riſe if the elaſticity of the ſteam is not equal to 30— <hi rend="superscript"> 30</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, that is, to 26,7 inches nearly ; but if it is juſt this quantity, the piſton will riſe as Faſt as this ſteam can be ſupplied through the ſteam-pipe, and the velocity of its aſcent depends entirely on the velocity of this ſupply. This obſervation is of great importance ; and it does not ſeem to have occurred to the mathematicians, who have paid moſt attention to the mcchaniſm of the motion of this engine. In the mean time, we may clearly ſee that the entry of the ſteam depends chiefly on the counter weight at E : for ſuppoſe there was none, ſteam no ſtronger than air would not enter the cylinder at all ; and if the ſteam be ſtronger, it will enter only by the exceſs of its ſtrengtſh. Writers on the ſteam-engine (and even ſome of great reputation) familiarly ſpeak of the ſteam giving the piſton a puſh : But this is ſcarcely poſſible. During the riſe of the piſton the ſhifting valve is never obſerved to blow; and we have not heard any well atteſted accounts of the piſton- chains. ever being ſlackened by the upward preſſure of the ſteam, even at the very beginning of the ſtroke. During the riling of the piſton the ſteam is (according to the common conception and manner of ſpeaking) s <hi rend="italic">ucked in,</hi> in the ſame way that air is sucked into a common ſyringe or pump when we draw up the piſton ; for in the ſteam-engine the piſton is really drawn up by the counter weight. But it is ſtill more sucked in, and requires a more copious ſupply, for another reaſon. As the piſton deſcended only in conſequence of the inſide of the cylinder’s being ſufficiently cooled to condenſe the ſteam, this cooled ſurface muſt again be preſented to the ſteam during the riſe of the piſton, and muſt condenſe ſteam a ſecond time. The piſton cannot rise another inch till the part of the cylinder which the piſton has already quitted has been warmed up to the boiling point, and ſteam muſt be expended in this warming. The inner ſurface of the cylinder is not only of the heat of boiling water while the piſton riſes, but is also perfectly dry ; for the film of water left on it by the aſcending piſton muſt be completely evaporated, otherwise it will be condenſing ſteam. That the quantity thus waſted is conſiderable, appears by the experiments of Mr Beighton. He found that five pints of water were boiled off in a minute, and produced 16 ſtrokes of an engine whoſe cylinder contained 113 gallons of 282 inches each ; and he thence concluded that ſteam was 2886 times rarer them water. But in no experiment made with ſcrupulous care on the expanſion of boiling water</p><p>does it appear that the denſity of ſteam exceeds 1/10,000th of the denſity of water. Deſaguliers ſays that it is above 14,000 times rarer than water. We have frequently attempted to meaſure the weight of ſteam which filled a very light vessel, which held 12,600 grains of water, and found it always leſs than one grain ; ſo that we have no doubt of its being much more than 10,000 times rarer than water. This being the caſe, we may ſafely ſuppoſe that the number of gallons of ſteam, inſtead of being 16 times 113, were nearly five times as much ; and that only <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th were employed in allowing the piſton to riſe, and the remaining <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths were employed to warm the cylinder.</p><p>The moving force during the aſcent of the piſton muſt be conſidered as reſulting chiefly, if not ſolely, from the preponderating weight of the pit piſton-rods. The office of this is to return the ſteam-piſton to the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0756.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0750"/>
top of the cylinder, where it may again be preſſed down by the air, and make another working ſtroke by raiſing the pump rods. But the counter-weight at E has another ſervice to perform in this uſe of the engine ; namely, to return the pump piſtons into their places at the bottom of their reſpective working barrels, in order that they alſo may make a working ſtroke. This requires force independent of the friction and inertia of the moving parts ; for each piſton muſt be pulhed down through the water in the barrel, which muſt riſe through the piſton with a velocity whoſe proportion to the velocity of the piſton is the ſame with that of the bulk of the piſton to the bulk of the perforation through which the water riſes through the piſton. It is enough at preſent to mention this in general terms : we ſhall conſider it more particularly afterwards, when we come to calculate the performance of the engine, and to deduce from our acquired knowledge maxims of conſtruction and improvement.</p><p>From this general conſideration of the aſcent of the piſton, we may see that the motion differs greatly from the deſcent. It can hardly be ſuppoſed to accelerate, even if the ſteam in the cylinder were in a moment annilated. For the reſiſtance to the deſcent of the piſton is the ſame with the weight of the column of water, which would cauſe it to flow through the box of the pump piſton with the velocity with which it really riſes through it, and muſt therefore increaſe as the ſquare of that velocity increaſes ; that is, as the ſquare of the velocity of the piſton increaſes. Independent oſ friction, therefore, the velocity of deſcent through the water muſt ſoon become a maximum, and the motion become uniform. We ſhall ſee by and by, that in ſuch a pump as is generally uſed this will happen in leſs than the 10th part of a ſecond. The friction of the pump will diminiſh this velocity a little, and retard the time of its attaining uniformity. But, on the other hand, the supply of ſteam which is neceſſary for this motion, being ſuſceptible of no acceleration from its previous motion, and depending entirely on the briſkneſs of the ebullition, an almoſt inſtantaneos ſtop is put to acceleration.</p><p>Accordingly, any perſon who obſerves with attention the working of a ſteam-engine, will ſee that the rise of the piſton and deſcent of the pump-rods is extremely uniform, whereas the working ſtroke is very ſenſibly accelerated. Before quitting this part of the ſubject, and left it ſhould afterwards eſcape our recollection, we may obſerve, that the counter weight is different during the two motions of the pump-rods. While the machine is making a working ſtroke, it is lifting not only the column of water in the pump, but the abſolute weight of the piſtons and piston-rods alſo: but while the pump-rods are descending, there is a diminution of the counter weight by the whole weight loſt by the immerſion of the rod in water. The wooden rods which are generally uſed, ſoaked in water, and joined by iron ſtraps, are heavier, and but a little heavier than water, and they are generally about one third of the bulk of the water in the pumps.</p><p>Theſe two motions complete the period of the operation ; and the whole may be repeated by ſhutting the ſteam-cock and opening the injection-cock whenever the piſton has attained the proper height. We have been very minute in our attention to the different circumstances, that the reader may have a diſtinct notion of the ſtate of the moving forces in every period of the operation. It is by no means ſufficient that we know in general that the injection of cold water makes a void which allows the air to preſs down the piſton, and that the readmiſſion of the ſteam allows the piſton to rise again. This lumping and ſlovenly way of viewing it has long prevented even the philoſopher from seeing the defects of the conſtruction, and the methods of removing them.</p><p>We now ſee the great difference between Savary’s and Newcomen’s engine in reſpect ot principle. Savary’s was really an engine which raiſed water by the force of ſteam ; but Newcomen’s raiſes water entirely by the preſſure of the atmoſphere, and ſteam is employed merely as the moſt expeditious method of producing a void, into which the atmospherical preſſure may impel the <hi rend="italic">first mover</hi> of his machine. The elaſticity of the ſteam is not the firſt mover.</p><p>We ſee alſo the great ſuperiority of this new machine. We have no need of ſteam of great and dangerous elaſticity ; and we operate by means of very moderate heats, and conſequently with much ſmaller quantities of fuel ; and there is no bounds to the power of this machine. How deep ſoever a mine may be, a cylinder may be employed of ſuch dimenſions that the preſſure of the air on its piſton may exceed in any degree the weight of the column of water to be raiſed. And laſtly, this form of the machine renders it applicable to almoſt every mechanical purpoſe ; because a skilful mechanic can readily find a method of converting the eciprocating motion of the working beam into a motion of any kind which may suit his purpoſe. Savary’s engine could hardly admit of such an immediate application, and ſeems almoſt reſtricted to raising water.</p><p>Inventions improve by degrees. This engine was firſt offered to the public in 1705. But many difficulties occurred in the execution, which were removed one by one ; and it was not till 1712 that the engine ſeemed to give confidence in its efficacy. The moſt exact and unremitting attention of the manager was required to the preciſe moment of opening and ſhutting the cocks; and neglect might frequently be ruinous, by beating out the bottom of the cylinder, or allowing the piſton to be wholly drawn out of it. Stops were contrived to prevent both of theſe accidents ; then ſtrings were uſed to connect the handles of the cocks with the beam, ſo that they ſhould be turned whenever it was in certain positions. Theſe were gradually changed and improved into detents and catches oſ different ſhapes ; at last, in 1717, Mr Beighton, a very ingenious and well informed artiſt, simplified the whole of thele ſubordinate movements, and brought the machine into the form in which it has continued, without the ſmalleſt material change, to the preſent day. We ſhall now deſcribe one of theſe improved engines, copying almoſt exactly the drawings and deſcription given by Boſſut in his <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamique</hi>; theſe being by far the moſt accurate and perſpicuous of any that have been publiſhed.</p><p>Fig. 8. n⁰ 1. is a perſpective view of the boiler cylinder, and all the parts neceſſary for turning the cocks. Fig. 8. n⁰ 2. is a vertical ſection of the ſame ; and the ſame pieces of both are marked with the ſame letters of reference.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0757.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0751"/>
The rod X of the piſton P is ſuſpended from the arch oſ the wot king-beam, as was repreſented in the preceding ſketch (fig. 7). An upright bar of timber FG is also ſeen hanging by a chain. This is ſuſpended from a concentric arch of the beam, as may be ſeen alſo in the ſketch at φδ. This bar is called the p <hi rend="italic">lug-beam,</hi> and it must riſe and fall with the piſton, but with a flower motion. The uſe of this plug-beam is to give motion to the different pieces which turn the cocks.</p><p>The ſteam-pipe K is of one piece with the bottom of the cylinder, and riſes within it an inch or two, to prevent any of the cold injection water from falling into the boiler. The lower extremity Z of the ſteam- pipe penetrates the head of the boiler, projecting a little way. A flat plate of brass, in ſhape resembling a racket or battledore, called the <hi rend="italic">regulator,</hi> applies itſelf exactly to the whole circumference of the ſteam-pipe, and completely excludes the ſteam from the cylinder. Being moveable round an upright axis, which is repreſented by the dotted lines at the fide of the ſteam-pipe in the profile, it may be turned aſide by the handle <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> η I. The profile ſhows in the lection oſ this plate a protuberance in the middle. This refis on a ſtrong flat ſpring, which is fixed below it athwart the mouth of the ſteam-pipe. This ſpring preſſes it ſtrongly towards the ſteam-pipe, cauſing it to apply very cloſe ; and this knob Aides along the ſpring, while the regulator turns to the right or left.</p><p>We have ſaid that the injection water is ſurniſhcd from a ciſtern placed above the cylinder. When this ciſtern cannot be ſupplied by pipes from ſome more elevated ſource, its water is railed by the machine itſelf. A ſmall lifting pump <hi rend="italic">ik</hi> (fig. 7.), called the <hi rend="italic">jackhead</hi> or <hi rend="italic">jacquette,</hi> is worked by a rod γι <hi rend="italic">,</hi> ſuſpended from a concentric arch ε γ near the outer end of the working beam. This forces a ſmall portion of the pit water along the riſing pipe <hi rend="italic">i</hi> LM into the injection ciſtern.</p><p>In figure 8. n⁰ 1. and 2. the letters QM 3' repre- ſent the pipe which brings down the water from the injection ciſtern. This pipe has a cock at R to open or shut the paſſage of this water. It ſpouts through the jet 3', and daſhing againſt the bottom or the piſton, it is disperſed into drops, and ſcattered through the whole capacity of the cylinder, ſo as to produce a rapid condenſation oſ the ſteam.</p><p>An upright post A may be obſerved in the perſpective view of the cylinder, &amp;c. This ſupports one end B of a horizontal iron axis BC. The end C is ſupported by a ſimilar poſt, of which the place only is marked by the dotted lines A, that the pieces connected with this axis may not be hid by it. A kind of stirrup <hi rend="italic">abcd</hi> hangs from this axis, ſupported by the hooks <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This ſtirrup is croffed near the bottom by a round bolt or bar <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which passes through the eyes or rings that are at the ends of the horizontal fork <hi rend="italic">bfg,</hi> whoſe long tail <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is double, receiving between its branches the handle <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of the regulator. It is plain from this conſtruction, that when the ſtirrup is made to vibrate round the horizontal axis BC, on which it hangs freely by its hooks, the bolt <hi rend="italic">e</hi> muſt pull or puſh the long fork h <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> backwarks and forwards horizontally, and by ſo doing will move the regulator round its axis by means of the handle 2. Both the tail of the fork and the handle of the regulator are pierced with ſeveral holes, and a pin is put through them which unites them by a joint. The motion of the handle may be increa- ſed or diminiſhed by choosing for the joint a hole near to the axis or remote from it ; and the exact poſition at which the regulator is to ſtop on both ſides is determined by pins ſtuck in the horizontal bar on which the end of the handle appears to rest.</p><p>This alternate motion oſ the regulator to the right and left is produced as follows : There is fixed to the axis BC a piece of iron <hi rend="italic">ok l,</hi> called the Y, on account of its reſemblance to that letter of the alphabet inverted. The stalk <hi rend="italic">o</hi> carries a heavy lump <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of lead or iron; and a long leather ſtrap <hi rend="italic">qpr</hi> is faſtened to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> by the middle, and the two ends are faſtened to the beam above it, in ſuch a manner that the lump may be alternately catched and held up to the right and left of the perpendicular. By adjuſting the length of the two parts of the ſtrap, the Y may be flopped in any desired. poſition. The two, claws <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> spread out from each other, and from the line of the ſtalk, and they are of such length as to reach the horizontal bolt <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which croffes the ſtirrup below, but not to reach the bottom of the fork <hi rend="italic">hfg.</hi> Now ſuppoſe the ſtirrup hanging perpendicularly, and the ſtalk of the Y alſo held perpendicular ; carry it a little outward from the cylinder, and then let it go. It will tumble farther out by its weight, without affecting the ſtirrup till the claw Z ſtrikes on the horizontal bolt <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and then it pushes the ſtirrup and the fork towards the cylinder, and opens the regulator. It lets it in motion with a ſmart jerk, which is an effectual way of overcoming the cohesion and friction of the regulator with the mouth of the ſteam-pipe. This puſh is adjuſted to a proper length by the ſtrap <hi rend="italic">q ρ,</hi> which ſtops the Y when it has gone far enough. If we now take hold of the ſtalk of the Y, and move it up to the perpendicular, the width between its claws is ſuch as to permit this motion, and ſomething more, without affecting the ſtirrup. But when puſhed ſtill nearer to the cylinder, it tumbles towards it by its own weight, and then the claw <hi rend="italic">k</hi> ſtrikes the bolt <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and drives the ſtirrup and fork in the oppoſite direction, till the lump <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is catched by the ſtrap <hi rend="italic">rp,</hi> now ſtretched to its full length, while <hi rend="italic">qp</hi> hangs flack. Thus by the motion of the Y the regulator is opened and ſhut. Let us now ſee how the motion of the Y is produced by the machine itſelf. To the horizontal axis BC are attached two ſpanners or handles <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">η.</hi> The ſpanner <hi rend="italic">m</hi> paſſes through a long slit in the plugbeam, and is at liberty to move upwards or downwards by its motion round the axis BC. A pin π which goes through the plug-beam catches hold of m when the beam riſes along with the piſton; and the pin is ſo placed, that when the beam is within an inch or two of its higheſt riſe, the pin has lifted m and thrown the ſtalk of the Y paſt the perpendicular. It therefore tumbles over with great force, and gives a ſmart blow to the fork, and immediately ſhuts the regulator. By this motion the ſpanner <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is removed out of the neigh, bourhood of the plug-beam. But the ſpanner <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> moving along with it in the same direction, now comes into the way of the pins of the plug-beam. Therefore, when the piſton deſcends again by the condenſation of the ſteam in the cylinder, a pin marked &amp; in the side oſ the plug-beam catches hold of the tail of the ſpanner n, and by preſſing it down raiſes the lump on the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0758.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0752"/>
ſtalk of the Y till it paſſes the perpendicular, and it then falls down, outwards from the cylinder, and the claw <hi rend="italic">l</hi> again drives the fork in the direction <hi rend="italic">h l,</hi> and opens the ſteam valve. This opening and ſhutting of the ſteam valve is executed in the preciſe moment that is proper, by placing the pins π and Ϭ at a proper height in the plug-beam. For this reaſon, it is pierced through with a great number of holes, that the places of theſe pins may be varied at pleaſure. This, and a proper curvature of the ſpanners <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and n, make the adjuſtment as nice as we pleaſe.</p><p>The injection-cock R is managed in a ſimilar manner. On its key may be obſerved a forked arm <hi rend="italic">s t,</hi> like a crab’s claw ; at a little diſtance above it is the gudgeon or axis <hi rend="italic">u</hi> of a piece <hi rend="italic">y u z ,</hi> called the hammer or the F, from its reſemblance to that letter. It has a lump of metal <hi rend="italic">y</hi> at one end, and a ſpear <hi rend="italic">u s</hi> projects from its middle, and paſſes between the claws <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the arm of the injection-cock. The hammer <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is held up by a notch in the underside of a wooden lever DE, moveable round the centre D, and ſupported at a proper height by a ſtring <hi rend="italic">r</hi> E made faſt to the joiſt above it.</p><p>Suppoſe the injection-cock ſhut, and the hammer in the poſition repreſented in the figure. A pin s oſ the plug-frame riſes along with the piſton, and catching hold of the detent DE, raiſes it, and diſengages the hammer <hi rend="italic">y</hi> from its notch. This immediately falls down, and ſtrikes a board L put in the way to stop it. The ſpear us takes hold pf the claw <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and forces it aſide towards <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and opens the injection-cock. The piſton immediately deſcends, and along with it the plug-frame. During its deſcent the pin <hi rend="italic">β</hi> meets with the tail <hi rend="italic">u z</hi> of the hammer, which is now raiſed considerably above the level, and brings it down along with it, raising the lumpy, and gradually shutting the injection-cock, becauſe the ſpear takes hold of the claw s of its arm. When the beam has come to its loweſt situation, the hammer is again engaged in the notch of the detent DE, and ſupported by it till the piſton again reaches the top of the cylinder.</p><p>In this manner the motions of the injection cock are alſo adjuſted to the preciſe moment that is proper for them. The different pins are ſo placed in the plugframe, that the ſteam-cock may be completely ſhut before the injection cock is opened. The inherent motion of the machine will give a ſmall addition to the aſcent of the piſton without expending ſteam all the while ; and by leaving; the ſteam rather leſs elaſtic than before, the ſubſequent deſcent of the piſton is promoted. There is a considerable propriety in the gradual ſhutting of the injection-cock. For after the firſt daſh of the cold water against the bottom of the piſton, the condenſation is nearly complete, and very little more water is needed; but a continual acceſſion of some is abſolutely neceſſary for completing the condenſation, as the capacity of the cylinder diminiſhes, and the water warms which is already injected.</p><p>In this manner the motion of the machine will be repeated as long as there is a ſupply of ſteam from the boiler, and of water from the injection ciſtern, and a diſcharge procured for what has been injected. We proceed to conſider how theſe conditions alſo are provided by the machine itſelf.</p><p>The injection ciſtern is ſupplied with water by the jackhead-pump, as we have already obſerved. From this ſource all the parts of the machine receive their reſpective ſupplies. In the firſt place, a ſmall branch 13, 13, is taken off from the injection-pipe immediately below the ciſtern, and conducted to the top of the cylinder, where it is furniſhed with a cock. The ſpout is ſo adjuſted, that no more runs from it than what will keep a constant ſupply of a foot of water above the piston to keep it tight. Every time the piſton comes to the top of the cylinder, it brings this water along with it, and the ſurplus of its evaporation and leakage runs off by a waste pipe 14, 14. This water neceſſarily becomes almost boiling hot, and it was thought proper to employ its overplus for ſupplying the waste of the boiler. This was accordingly practiced for ſome time. But Mr Beighton improved this economical thought, by ſupplying the boiler from the eduction-pipe 2, <hi rend="italic">2,</hi> the water of which muſt be ſtill hotter than that above the piſton. This contrivance required attention to many circumſtances, which the reader will understand by considering the perſpective and profile. The eduction pipe comes out of the bottom of the cylinder at 1 with a perpendicular part, which bends sidewiſe below, and is ſhut at the extremity 1, A deep cup 5 communicates with it, holding a metal valve nicely fitted to it by grinding, like the key of a cock. To secure its being always air-tight, a ſlender ſtream of water trickles into it from a branch 6 of the waſte pipe from the top of the cylinder. The eduction-pipe branches off at 2, and goes down to the hot well, where it turns up, and is covered with a valve. In the perſpective view may be obſerved an upright pipe 4, 4, which goes through the head of the boiler, and reaches to within a few inches of its bottom. This pipe is called the <hi rend="italic">feeder,</hi> and riſes about three or four feet above the boiler. It is open at both ends, and has a branch 3, 3, communicating with the bottom of the cup 5, immediately above the metal valve, and alſo a few inches below the level of the entry 2 of the eduction-pipe. This communicating branch has a cock by which its paſſage may be diminiſhed at pleaſure. Now ſuppoſe the ſteam in the boiler to be very ſtrong ; it will cauſe the boiling water to riſe in the feeding pipe above 3, and coming along this branch, to riſe alſo in the cup 5, and run over. But the height of this cup above the ſurface of the water in the boiler is ſuch, that the ſteam is never ſtrong enough to produce this effect. Therefore, on the contrary, any water that may be in the cup 5 will run off by the branch 3,3, and go down into the boiler by the feeding-pipe.</p><p>Theſe things being understood, let us ſuppoſe a quantity of injected water lying at the bottom of the cylinder. It will run into the eduction pipe, fill the crooked branch 1, 1, and open the valve in the bottom of the cup (its weight being ſupported by a wire hanging from a ſlender ſpring), and it will fill the cup to the level of the entry 2 of the eduction-pipe, and will then flow along 3, 3, and ſupply the boiler by the feeder 4, 4. What more water runs in at 1 will now go along the eduction-pipe 2, 2, to the hot well. By properly adjuſting the cock on the branch 3,3, the boiler may be ſupplied as faſt as the waste in ſteam requires. This is a moſt ingenious contrivance, and does great hoqour to Mr Beighton It is not, however, of much importance. The ſmall quantity which the boiler requires<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0759.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0753"/>
may be immediately taken even from a cold ciſtern, without ſenſibly diminiſhing the production of ſteam: for the quantity of heat neceſſary for raiſing the ſenſible heat of cold water to the boiling temperature is quite inſignificant, when compared with the quantity of heat which muſt then be combined with it in order to convert the water into ſteam. No difference can be obſerved in the performance of ſuch engines and of thoſe which have their boilers ſupplied from a brook. It has, however, the advantage of being purged of air ; and when an engine muſt derive all its ſupplies from pit water, the water from the eduction-pipe is vaſtly preferable to that from the top of the cylinder.</p><p>We may here obſerve, that many writers (among them the Abbé Boſſut), in their deſcriptions of the ſteam-engine, have drawn the branch of communication 3, 3, from the feeding pipe to a part of the crooked pipe 1, 1, lying below the valve in the cup 5. But this is quite erroneous ; for, in this caſe, when the injection is made into the cylinder, and a vacuum produced, the water from the boiler would immediately ruſh up through the pipes 4, 3, and ſpout up into the cylinder : ſo would the external air coming in at the top of the feeder.</p><p>This contrivance has alſo enabled us to form ſome judgment of the internal ſtate of the engine during the performance. Mr Beighton paid a minute attention to the ſituation of the water in the feeders and eduction-pipe of an engine, which ſeems to have been one of the beſt which has yet been erected. It was lifting a column of water whole weight was <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ths of the preſſure of the air on its piſton, and made 16 ſtrokes, of 6 feet each, in a minute. This is acknowledged by all to be a very great performance of an engine of this form. He concluded that the elaſticity of the ſteam in the cylinder was never more than one-tenth greater or leſs than the elaſticity of the air. The water in the ſeeder never roſe more than three feet and a half above the ſurface of the boiling water, even though it was now lighter by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 27</hi> th than cold water. The eduction-pipe was only 44 feet long (vertically), and yet it always diſcharged the injection water completely, and allowed ſome to paſs into the feeder. This could not be if the ſteam was much more than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th weaker than air. By graſping this pipe in his hand during the rise of the piſton, he could gueſs very well whereabouts the ſurface of the hot water in it reſted during the motion, and he never found it ſupported ſo high as four feet. Therefore the ſteam in the cylinder had at leaſt <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> ths of the elaſticity of the air. Mr Buat, in his examination of an engine which is erected at Montrelaix, in France, by an Engliſh engineer, and has always been conſidered as the pattern in that country, finds it neceſſary to ſuppoſe a much greater variation in the ſtrength of the ſteam, and ſays that it muſt have been <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th ſtronger and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th weaker than common air. But this engine has not been nearly ſo perfect. Its list was not more than ½ of the preſſure of the atmoſphere, and it made but nine ſtrokes in a minute.— At W is a valve covering the mouth of a ſmall pipe, and ſurrounded with a cup containing water to keep it air-tight. This allows the air to eſcape which had been extricated from the water of laſt injection. It is driven out by the firſt ſtrong puff of ſteam which is admitted into the cylinder, and makes a noiſe in its exit. This valve is therefore called the ſnifting valve.</p><p>To finish our description, we obſerve, that besides the ſafety valve 9 (called the <hi rend="smallcaps">puppet clack),</hi> which is loaded with about 3 pounds on the ſquare inch (though the engine will work very well with a load of 1 or 2 pounds), there is another <hi rend="smallcaps">discharger</hi> 10,10, having a clack at its extremity ſupported by a cord. Its uſe is to diſcharge the ſteam without doors, when the machine gives over working. There is alſo a pipe S I near the bottom of the boiler, by which it may be emptied when it needs repairs or cleansing.</p><p>There are two ſmall pipes 11,11,and 12,12, with cocks called <hi rend="smallcaps">gage-pipes;</hi> The firſt deſcends to within two inches of the ſurface of the water in the boiler, and the second goes about 2 inches below that ſurface. If both cocks emit ſteam, the water is too low, and requires a recruit. If neither give ſteam, it is too high, and there is not sufficient room above it for a collection of ſteam. Laſtly, there is a filling pipe by which the boiler may be filled when the machine is to be let to work.</p><p>The engine has continued in this form for many years. The only remarkable change introduced has been the manner of placing the boiler. It is no longer placed below the cylinder, but at one side, and the ſteam is introduced by a pipe from the top of the boiler into a flat box immediately below the cylinder. The uſe of this box is merely to lodge the regulator, and give room for its motions. This has been a very conſiderable improvement. It has greatly reduced the height of the building. This was formerly a tower. The wall which ſupported the beam could hardly be built with sufficient ſtrength for withſtanding the violent ſhocks which were repeated without ceaſing ; and the buildings ſeldom laſted more than a very lew years. But the boiler is now ſet up in an adjoining ſhed, and the gudgeons of the main beam rest on the top of upright poſts, which are framed into the joiſts which ſupport the cylinder. Thus the whole moving parts of the machine are contained in one compact frame of carpentry, and have little or no connection with the flight walls of the building, which is merely a caſe to hold the machine, and protect it from the weather.</p><p>It is now time to inquire what is to be expected from ; this machine, and to aſcertain the moſt advantageous ; proportion between the moving power and the load that is to be laid on the machine.</p><p>It may be conſidered as a preat pulley, and is indeed ſometimes ſo conſtructed, the arches at the ends <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the t working beam being completed to a circle. It muſt be unequally loaded that it may move. It is loaded, during the working ſtroke, by the pressure of the atmoſphere on the piſton side, and by the column of water to be raised and the pump-gear on the pump side.— During the returning ſtroke it is loaded, on the piſton side, by a ſmall part of the atmospheric preſſure, and on the pump side by the pump gear acting as a counter weight. The load during the working ſtroke muſt therefore consiſt of the column of water to be raiſed and this counter weight. The performance of the machine is to be meaſured only by the quantity of water raiſed in a given time to a given height, lt varies, therefore, in the joint proportion of the weight of the column of water in the pumps, and the number of ſtrokes made by the machine in a minute. Each ſtroke conflits of two parts, which we have called the working and the returning ſtroke. It does not, therefore, depend ſimply on the velocity of the working ſtroke and the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0760.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0754"/>
quantity of water raiſed by it. Iſ this were all that is to be attended to, we know that the weight of the column of water ſhould be nearly <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of the preſſure of the atmoſphere, this being the proportion which gives the maximum in the common pulley. But the time of the returning ſtroke is a neceſſary part of the whole time elapſed, and therefore the velocity of the returning ſtroke equally merits attention. This is regulated by the counter weight. The number of ſtrokes <hi rend="italic">per</hi> minute does not give an immediate proof of the goodneſs of the engine. A ſmall load of water and a great counter weight will enſure this, becauſe theſe conditions will produce a briſk motion in both directions.— The proper adjuſtment of the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the piſton, the column of water to be raiſed, and the counter weight, is a problem of very great difficulty ; and mathematicians have not turned much of their attention to the subject, although it is certainly the moſt intereſting queſtion that practical mechanics affords them.</p><p>Mr Boſſut has ſolved it very ſhortly and simply, upon this ſuppoſition, that the working and returning ſtroke ſhould be made in equal times. This, indeed, is generally aimed at in the erection of theſe machines, and they are not reckoned to be well arranged if it be otherwise. We doubt oſ the propriety of the maxim. Supposing, however, this condition for the preſent, we may compute the loadings of the two ends of the beam as follows. Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the length of the inner arm of the working beam, or that by which the great piſton is ſupported. Let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the outer arm carrying the pump rods, and let W be a weight equivalent to all the load which is laid on the machine. Let <hi rend="italic">c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> be the area of the piſton ; let H be the height of a column of water having c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> for its baſe, and being equal in weight to the preſſure exerted by the ſteam on the under side of the piſton ; and let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the ſame area, or the height oſ a column of water of equal weight. It is evident that both ſtrokes will be performed in equal times, if <hi rend="italic">h c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">a</hi> — W <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be equal to (h — H) <hi rend="italic">c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">a +</hi> W <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The first of theſe quantities is the energy of the machine during the working ſtroke, and the second expreſſes the ſimilar energy during the returning ſtroke. This equation gives us W = 2 <hi rend="italic">h c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">a —</hi> H <hi rend="italic">c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">a (2h —</hi> H) c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> a</p><p>2 <hi rend="italic">b 2 b</hi></p><p>the arms of the lever equal and H ≡ <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> we have W <hi rend="italic">h</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">= c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">—</hi>; that is, the whole weight of the outer end</p><p>of the beam ſhould be half the preſſure of the air on the great piſton. This is nearly the uſual practice ; and the engineers expreſs it by ſaying, that the engine is loaded with ſeven or eight pounds on the ſquare inch. This has been found to be nearly the moſt advantageous load. This way of expreſſing the matter would do well enough, if the maxim were not founded on erroneous notions, which hinder us from ſeeing the ſtate of the machine, and the circumſtances on which its improvement depends. The piſton bears a preſſure of 15 pounds, it is ſaid, on the ſquare inch, if the vacuum below it be perfect ; but as this is far from being the caſe, we muſt not load it above the power of its vacuum, which very little exceeds eight pounds. But this is very far from the truth. When the cylinder is tight, the vacuum is not more than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> th deficient, when the cylinder is cooled by the injection to the degree that is every day practicable, and the piſton really bears during its deſcent a preſſure very near to 14 pounds on the inch. The load muſt be diminiſhed, not on account of the imperfect vacuum, but to give the machine a reaſonable motion. We muſt conſider not only the moving force, but alſo the quantity of matter to be put in motion. This is ſo great in the ſteam engine, that even if it were balanced, that is, if there were ſuſpended on the piſton arm a weight equal to the whole column of water and the counter weight, the full preſſure of the atmoſphere on the ſteam piſton would not make it move twice as faſt as it does.</p><p>This equation by Mr Boſſut is moreover eſſentially faulty in another reſpect. The W in the first member is not the ſame with the W in the second. In the first it is the column of water to be raiſed, together with the counter weight. In the second it is the counter weight only. Nor is the quantity H the ſame in both cases, as is moſt evident. The proper equation for enſuring the equal duration of the two ſtrokes may be had in the following manner. Let it be determined by experiment what portion of the atmoſpheric preſſure is exerted on the great piſton during its deſcent. This depends on the remaining elaſticity of the ſteam. Suppose it <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths: this we may expreſs by ah, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being = <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths. Let it alſo be determined by experiment what portion of the atmoſpheric preſſure on the piſton remains unbalanced by the ſteam below it during its aſcent. Suppoſe this <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th, we may expreſs this by <hi rend="italic">b h.</hi> Then let W be the weight of the column of water to be raiſed, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the counter weight. Then, if the arms of the beam are equal, we have the energy during the working ſtroke =ah <hi rend="italic">—</hi> W — c, and during the returning ſtroke it is = <hi rend="italic">c — b h.</hi> Therefore <hi rend="italic">c — b h zz a h —</hi> W — <hi rend="italic">c</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">c h(a + b) - W</hi>; which, on the above ſuppoſition of the values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> gives us <hi rend="italic">c = h-W/2.</hi> We ſhall make ſome uſe of this equation afterwards ; but it affords us no information concerning the moſt advantageous proportion of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and W, which is the material point.</p><p>We muſt conſider this matter in another way : And that we may not involve ourſelves in unneceſſary difficulties, let us make the caſe as simple as poſſible, and ſuppoſe the arms of the working-beam to be of equal length.</p><p>We ſhall first conſider the adjuſtment of things at the outer end of the beam.</p><p>Since the ſole uſe of the ſteam is to give room for the action of the atmoſpheric preſſure by its rapid condensibility, it is admitted into the cylinder only to allow the piſton to riſe again, but without giving it any impulſe. The pump-rods muſt therefore be returned to the bottom of the working barrels by means of a preponderancy at the outer end of the beam. It may be the weight of the pump, rods themſelves, or may be conſidered as making part of this weight. A weight at the end of the beam will not operate on the rods which are ſuſpended there by chains, and it muſt therefore be attached to the rods themſelves, but above their reſpective pump-barrels, ſo that it may not loſe part of its efficacy by immerſion in the water. We may conſider the whole under the notion of the pump-gear, and call it p. Its office is to depreſs the-pump-rods with ſuffi-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0761.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0755"/>

It will be ſo much the greater as the work done is greater, and the power employed is leſs ; and will therefore be properly measured by the quotient of the work done divided by the power employed.</p><p>The work immediately done is the lifting up the weight L. In order to accompliſh this, we muſt employ a preſſure P, which is greater than L. Let it be — L + <hi rend="italic">y ;</hi> alſo let <hi rend="italic">s</hi> be the length of the ſtroke.</p><p>If the maſs L were urged along the ſpace <hi rend="italic">s</hi> by the force L+y, it would acquire a certain velocity, which we may expreſs by s ; but it is impelled only by the force <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the rest of P being employed in balancing L. The velocities which different forces generate by impelling a body along the ſame space are as the ſquare roots of the forces. Therefore √L + y : √ <hi rend="italic">y =</hi> √s : √sy. The fourth term of this analogy expreſſes the</p><p>√L+y velocity of the piſton at the end of the ſtroke. The quantity of motion produced will be had by multiplying this velocity by the maſs L. This gives</p><p>L=y and this, divided by the power expended, or by L+y', gives us the meaſure of the performance ; namely, L (sy) That this may be a maximum, conſider <hi rend="italic">y</hi> as the va-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0762.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0756"/>
riable quantity, and make the fluxion oſ this formula</p><p>= o. This will give us y = L/2.</p><p>Now P=L+y, =L+1/2 , = 3/2L. Therefore the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> load on the outer end of the beam, conſiſting of the water and the counter weight, muſt be <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ds of the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the ſteam piſton.</p><p>We have here ſuppoſed that the expenditure is the atmoſpheric preſſure ; and ſo it is if we conſider it mechanically. But the expenditure of which we are ſensible, and which we are anxious to employ to the beſt advantage, is fuel. Suppoſing this to be employed with the ſame judgment in all caſes, we are almoſt intitled, by what we now know of the production oſ ſteam, to ſay that the ſteam produced is proportional to the fuel expended. But the ſteam requiſite for merely filling the cylinder is proportional to the area of the piſton, and therefore to the atmoſpheric preſſure. The reſult of our inveſtigation therefore is ſtill juſt ; but the ſteam wasted by condenſation on the ſides of the cylinder does not follow this ratio, and this is more than what is neceſſary for merely filling it. This deranges our calculations, and is in favour of large cylinders; but this advantage muſt be in a great meaſure compenſated by a ſimilar variation in the production of the ſteam ; for in ſimilar boilers of greater dimenſions the fuel is leſs advantageouſly employed, becauſe the ſurface to which the fuel is applied does not increaſe in the ratio of the capacity, juſt as the ſurface of the cylinder which waſtes the ſteam. The rule may therefore be confided in as pretty exact.</p><p>It is a ſatissactory thing to obſerve theſe reſults agree very well with the moſt ſucceſsful practice. By many changes and trials engineers have eſtabliſhed maxims of conſtruction, which are probably not very far from the beſt. It is a pretty general maxim, that the load of water ſhould be ½ of the atmoſpheric preſſure. They call this loading the engine with 7½pounds on the inch, and they ſay that ſo ſmall a load is neceſſary on account of the imperfect vacuum. But we have now ſeen that it is neceſſary for giving a reaſonable velocity of motion. Since, in this practice, w is made 1/2 or 6/12ths of P, and L ſhould be 8/11ths of P, and L is <hi rend="italic">≡ w</hi> + p ; it follows, that the counter weight ſhould be 1/6th of P; and we have found this to be nearly the caſe in ſeveral very good engines.</p><p>It muſt be remarked, that in the preceding inveſtigation we introduced a quantity M to expreſs the reſiſtances to the motion of the engine. This was done in order to avoid a very troubleſome inveſtigation. The resiſtances are of ſuch a nature as to vary with the velocity, and moſt of them as the ſquare of the velocity. This is the caſe with the resiſtance arising from the motion of the water through the piſtons of the pumps, and that arising ſrom the friction in the long lift during the working ſtroke. Had we taken the direct method, which is ſimilar to the determination of the motion thro’ a medium which resiſts in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, we muſt have uſed a very intricate exponential calculus, which few of our readers would have the patience to look at.</p><p>But the greateſt part of the quantity <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ſuppoſes a motion already known, and its determination depends on this motion. We muſt now ſhow how its different component parts may be computed.</p><p>I. What ariſes from the inertia of the moving parts is by far the moſt conſiderable portion of it. To obtain it, we muſt find a quantity of matter which, when placed at the end of the beam, will have the ſame momentum of inertia with that of the whole moving parts in their natural places. Therefore (in the returning ſtroke) add together the weight of the great piſton with its rod and chains ; the pit pump-rods, chains, and any weight that is attached to them ; the arch-heads and iron-work at the ends of the beam, and 4/9ths of the weight of the beam itſelf ; alſo the plug-beam with its arch-head and chain, multiplied by the ſquare of its diſtance from the axis, and divided by the ſquare of half the length of the beam ; alſo the jack-head pump-rod, chain, and arch-head, multiplied by the ſquare of its diſtance from the axis, and divided by the ſquare of the half-length of the beam. Theſe articles added into one ſum may be called M, and may be ſuppoſed to move with the velocity of the end of the beam. Suppoſe this beam to have made a six-foot ſtroke in two ſeconds, with an uniformly accelerated motion. In one ſecond it would have moved 1½ feet, and would have acquired the velocity of three feet per ſecond. But in one ſecond gravity would have produced a velocity of 32 feet in the ſame maſs. Therefore the accelerating force which has produced the velocity of three feet is nearly M</p><p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi> th of the weight. Therefore — is the first constituent of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in the above inveſtigation. If the obſerved velocity is greater or leſs than three feet per ſecond, this value muſt be increaſed or diminiſhed in the ſame proportion.</p><p>The ſecond cauſe of refiſtance, viz. the immerſion of the pump rods in water, is eaſily computed, being the weight of the water which they diſplace.</p><p>The third cauſe, the friction of the piſtons, &amp;c. is almoſt insignificant, and muſt be diſcovered by experiment.</p><p>The fourth cauſe depends on the structure of the pumps. Theſe pumps, when made of a proper ſtrength, can hardly have the perforation of the piſton more than a fourth part of the area of the working barrel ; and the velocity with which the water paſſes through it is increaſed at leaſt 1/4th by the contraction (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Pump).</hi> The velocity of the water is therefore five times greater than that of the piſton. A piſton 12 inches diameter, and moving one foot per ſecond, meets with a refiſtance equal to 20 pounds; and this increaſes as the ſquare of the diameter and as the ſquare of the velocity. If the whole depth of the pit be divided into ſeveral lifts, this refiſtance muſt be multiplied by the number of lifts, becauſe it obtains in each pump.</p><p>Thus we make up the value of <hi rend="italic">m ;</hi> and we must acknowledge that the method is still indirect, becauſe it ſuppoſes the velocity to be known.</p><p>We may obtain it more eaſily in another way, but ſtill with this circumstance of being indirect. We found that <hi rend="italic">p</hi> was equal to √L <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and conſequently <hi rend="italic">m = p</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">/L.</hi> Now in any engine L and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> can always be had ; and unleſs <hi rend="italic">p</hi> deviates greatly from the proportion which we determined to be the beſt, the value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> thus obtained will not be very erroneous.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0763.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0757"/>
It was farther preſumed in this inveſtigation, that the motions both up and down were uniformly accelerated ; but this cannot be the case when the reſiſtances increaſe with the velocity. This circumſtance makes very little change in the working-ſtroke, and therefore the theorem which determines the beſt relation oſ P to L may be confided in. The reſiſtances which vary with the velocity in this caſe are a mere trifle when compared with the moving power <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> Theſe reſiſtances are, 1st, The ſtrangling of the water at the entry and at the standing valve of each pump. This is about 37 pounds for a pump 12 inches diameter, and the velocity one foot per second, increaſing in the duplicate ratio of the diameter and velocity ; and, 2d, The friction of the water along the whole lift. This for a pump of the ſame ſize and with the ſame velocity, lifting 20 fathoms, is only about 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> pounds, and varies in the simple proportion of the diameter and the depth, and in the duplicate proportion of the velocity. The reſiſtance ariſing from inertia is greater than in the returning ſtroke; because the M in this caſe muſt contain the momentum of the water both of the pit-pumps and the jackheadpump : but this part of the reſiſtance does not affect the uniform acceleration. We may therefore confide in the propriety of the formula <hi rend="italic">y —L/2.</hi> And we may obtain the velocity of this ſtroke at the end of a second with great accuracy as follows. Let 2 <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be the velocity communicated by gravity in a ſecond, and the velocity at the end of the firſt ſecond of the ſteam piſton’s <hi rend="italic">y</hi></p><p>deſcent will be ſomewhat leſs than <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> M</hi> 2g; where <hi rend="italic">M</hi> expreſſes the inertia of all the parts which are in motion during the deſcent of the ſteam piſton, and therefore includes L. Compute the two reſiſtances juſt mentioned</p><p><hi rend="italic">y—1/2r</hi> for this velocity. Call this r. Then y-1/2r/M 2 <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will give another velocity infinitely near the truth.</p><p>But the caſe is very different in the returning ſtroke, and the proper ratio of p to L is not aſcertained with the ſame certainty : for the moving force <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is not ſo great in proportion to the reſiſtance <hi rend="italic">m</hi>; and therefore the acceleration of the motion is considerably affected by it, and the motion itſelf is conſiderably retarded, and in a very moderate time it becomes ſenſibly uniform: for it is preciſely ſimilar to the motion of a heavy body falling through the air, and may be determined in the manner laid down in the article <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Resistance</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Fluids,</hi> viz. by an exponential calculus. We ſhall content ourſelves here with ſaying, that the reſiſtances in the preſent caſe are ſo great that the motion would be to all ſenſe uniform before the piſtons have deſcended 1/3d of their ſtroke, even although there were no other circumſtance to affect it.</p><p>But this motion is affected by a circumſtance quite unconnected with any thing yet considered, depending on conditions not mechanical, and ſo uncertain, that we are not yet able to aſcertain them with any preciſion ; yet they are of the utmoſt importance to the good performance and improvement of the engine, and therefore deserve a particular consideration.</p><p>The counter weight has not only to puſh down the pump rods, but alſo to <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> up the great piſton. This it cannot do unless the ſteam be admitted into the cylinder. If the ſteam be no ſtronger than common air, it cannot enter the cylinder except <hi rend="italic">in conſequence</hi> of the piſton’s being dragged up. If common air were admitted into the cylinder, ſome force would be required to drag up the piſton, in the ſame manner as it is required to draw up the piſton of a common ſyringe ; for the air would ruſh through the ſmall entry of the cylinder in the ſame manner as through the ſmall nozzle of the ſyringe. Some part of the atmoſpheric preſſure is employed in driving in the air with sufficient velocity to fill the ſyringe, and it is only with the remainder that the admitted air preſſes on the under ſurface of the ſyringe. Therefore ſome of the atmoſpheric preſſure on its upper ſurface is not balanced. This is felt by the hand which draws it up. The ſame thing muſt happen in the ſteam-engine, and ſome part of the counter weight is expended in drawing up the ſteam-piſton. We could tell how much is thus expended if we knew the denſity of the ſteam ; for this would tell us the velocity with which its elaſticity would cauſe it to fill the cylinder. If we ſuppoſe it 12 times rarer than air, which it certainly is, and the piſton rises to the top of the cylinder in two seconds, we can demonſtrate that it will enter with a velocity not leſs than 1400 feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ſecond, whereas 500 feet is enough to make it maintain a denſity <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths of that of ſteam in equilibrio with the air. Hence it follows, that its elaſticity will not be leſs than 2/3 9ths of the elaſticity of the air, and therefore not more than 1/30th of counter weight will be expended in drawing up the ſteam-piſton.</p><p>But all this is on the ſuppoſition that there is an unbounded ſupply of ſteam of undiminiſhed elaſticity. This is by no means the caſe. Immediately before opening the ſteam-cock, the ſteam was iſſuing through the ſafety-valve and all the crevices in the top of the boiler, and (in good engines) was about 1/10th ſtronger or more elaſtic than air. This had been gathering during ſomething more than the deſeent of the piſton, viz. in about three seconds. The piſton riſes to the top in about two seconds; therefore about twice and a half as much ſteam as fills the dome of the boiler is now ſhared between the boiler and cylinder. The dome is commonly about six times more capacious than the cylinder. If therefore no ſteam is condenſed in the cylinder, the denſity of the ſteam, when the piſton has reached the top, muſt be about 15/10ths of its former denſity, and ſtill more elaſtic than air. But as much ſteam is condenſed by the cold cylinder, its elaſticity muſt be leſs than this. We cannot tell how much leſs, both becauſe we do not know how much is thus condenſed, and becauſe by this diminution of its preſſure on the ſurface of the boiling water, it muſt be more copiously produced in the boiler; but an attentive obſervation of the engine will give us ſome information. The moment the ſteam-cock is opened we have a ſtrong puff of ſteam through the ſnifting valve. At this time, therefore, it is ſtill more elaſtic than air ; but after this, the ſniſting valve remains ſhut during the whole riſe of the piſton, and no ſteam any longer iſſues through the ſafety-valve or crevices ; nay, the whole dome of the boiler may be obſerved to sink.</p><p>Theſe facts give abundant proof that the elaſticity of the ſteam during the alcent of the piſton is greatly diminiſhed, and therefore much of the counter weight is expended in dragging up the ſteam-piſton in opposition to the unbalanced part of the atmoſpheric preſſure. The<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0764.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0758"/>
motion of the returning ſtroke is therefore ſo much deranged by this foreign and inappreciated circumſtance, that it would have been quite uſeleſs to engage in the intricate exponential inveſtigation, and we muſt sit down contented with a leſs perfect adjuſtment of the counter weight and weight of water. — Any perſon who attends to the motion of a ſteam-engine will perceive that the deſcent of the pump-rods is ſo far from being accelerated, that it is nearly uniform, and frequently it is ſenſibly retarded towards the end. We learn by the way, that it is of the utmoſt importance not only to have a quick production of ſteam, but alſo a very capacious dome, or empty ſpace above the water in the boiler. In engines where this ſpace was but four or five times the capacity of the cylinder, we have always obſerved a very ſenſible check given to the deſcent of the pump rods after having made half their stroke. This obliges us to employ a greater counter weight, which diminiſhes the column of water, or retards the working ſtroke ; it alſo obliges us to employ a ſtronger ſteam, at the riſk of burſting the boiler, and increaſes the expence of fuel.</p><p>It would be a moſt deſirable thing to get an exact knowledge of the elaſticity of the ſteam in the cylinder; and this is by no means difficult. Take a long glaſs tube exactly calibered, and cloſe at the farther end. Put a ſmall drop of ſome coloured fluid into it, so as to ſtand at the middle nearly.—Let it be placed in a long box filled with water to keep it of a constant temperature. Let the open end communicate with the cylinder, with a cock between. The moment the ſteam-cock is opened, open the cock of this infiniment. The drop will be puſhed towards the cloſe end. of the tube, while the steam in the cylinder is more elaſtic than the air, and it will be drawn the other way while it is leſs elaſtic, and, by a ſeale properly adapted to it, the elaſticity of the fleam correſponding to every poſition of the piſton may be diſcovered. The ſame thing may be done more accurately by a barometer properly conſtructed, ſo as to prevent the oſcillations of the mercury.</p><p>It is equally neceſſary to know the ſtate of the cylinder during the deſcent of the ſteam-piſton. We have hitherto ſuppoſed P to be the full preſſure of the atmosphere on the area of the piſton, ſuppoſing the vacuum below it to be complete. But the inſpection of our table of elaſticity ſhows that this can never be the caſe, becauſe the cylinder is always of a temperature far above 32⁰. We have made many attempts to diſcover its temperature. We have employed a thermometer in cloſe contact with the side of the cylinder, which ſoon acquired a ſteady temperature : this was never leſs than 145⁰. We have kept a thermometer in the water which lies on the piſton: this never ſunk below 135⁰. It is probable that the cylinder within may be cooled somewhat lower; but for this opinion we cannot give any very satisfactory reaſon. Suppoſe it cooled down to 120⁰; this will leave an elaſticity which would support three inches of mercury. We cannot think therefore that the unbalanced preſſure of the atmoſphere exceeds that of 27 inches of mercury, which is about 134d pounds on a ſquare inch, or 10½ on a circular inch. And this is the value which we ſhould employ in the equation P — L+y This queſtion may be decided in the ſame way as the other, by a barometer connected with the inſide of the cylinder.</p><p>And thus we ſhall learn the ſtate of the moving forces in every moment of the performance, and the machine will then be as open to our examination as any water or horſe mill ; and till this be done, or ſomething equivalent, we can only gueſs at what the machine is actually performing, and we cannot tell in what particulars we can lend it a helping hand. We are informed that Meſſrs Watt and Boulton have made this addition to ſome of their engines ; and we are perſuaded that, from the information which they have derived from it, they have been enabled to make the curious improvements from which they have acquired ſo much reputation and profit.</p><p>There is a circumſtance of which we have as yet taken no notice, viz. the quantity of cold water injected. Here we confeſs ourſelves unable to give any preciſe inſtructions. It is clear at first fight that no more than is absolutely neceſſary ſhould be injected. It muſt generally be ſupplied by the engine, and this expends part of its power. An exceſs is much more hurtful by cooling the cylinder and piſton too much, and therefore wasting steam during the next riſe of the piſton. But the determination of the proper quantity requires a knowledge, which we have not yet acquired, of the quantity of heat contained in the ſteam in a latent form. As much water muſt be injected as will abſorb all this without riling near to the boiling temperature. But it is of much more importance to know how far we may cool the cylinder with advantage ; that is, when will the loſs of ſteam, during the next riſe of the piſton, compenſate for the diminution of its elaſticity during its preſent deſcent ? Our table of elaſticities ſhows us, that by cooling the cylinder to 120⁰, we ſtill leave an elaſticity equal to 1/10th of the whole power of the engine; if we cool it only to 140, we leave an elaſticity of 8/5th ; if we cool it to a blood-heat, we leave an elaſticity of 1/20th. It is extremely difficult to chooſe among theſe varieties. Experience, however, informs us, that the beſt engines are thoſe which uſe the ſmalleſt quantities of injection water. We know an exceedingly good engine having a cylinder of 30 inches and a six-foot ſtroke, which works with ſomething leſs than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of a cubic foot of water at each injection ; and we imagine that the quantity ſhould be nearly in the proportion of the capacity of the cylinder. Deaguliers obſerved, that a very good engine, with a cylinder of 32 inches, worked with 300 inches of water at each injection, which does not much exceed 1/6th of a cubic foot. Mr Watt’s obſervations, by means of the barometer, muſt have given him much valuable information in this particular, and we hope that he will not always withhold them from the public.</p><p>We have gone thus far in the examination, in order ſeemingly to aſcertain the motion of the engine when loaded and balanced in any known manner, and in order to diſcover that proportion between the moving power and the load which will produce the greateſt quantity of work. The reſult has been very unſatisfactory, becauſe the computation of the returning ſtroke is acknowledged to be beyond our abilities. But it has given us the opportunity of directing the reader’s attention to the leading circumſtances in this inquiry. By knowing the internal ſtate of the cylinder in machines of very different goodneſs, we learn the connection between the ſtate of the steam and the performance of the machine ; and it is very poſſible that the result of a full examination may be, that in ſituations where fuel is expensive, it may be proper to employ a weak ſteam which will expend leſs fuel, although leſs work is per<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0765.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0759"/>
formed by it. We ſhall ſee this confirmed in the cleareſt manner in ſome particular employments of the new engines invented by Watt and Boulton.</p><p>In the mean time, we ſee that the equation which we gave from the celebrated Abbé Boſſut is in every respect erroneous even for the purpoſe which he had in view. We alſo ſee that the equation which we ſubſtituted in its place, and which was intended for determining that proportion between the counterweight and the moving force, and the load which would render the working ſtroke and returning ſtroke of equal duration, is alſo erroneous, becauſe theſe two motions are extremely different in kind, the one being nearly uniform, and the other nearly uniformly accelerated. This being ſuppoſed true, it ſhould follow that the counter weight ſhould be reduced to one half ; and we have found this to be very nearly true in ſome good engines which we have examined.</p><p>We ſhall add but one obſervation more on this head. The practical engineers have almoſt made it a maxim, that the two motions are of equal duration. But the only reaſon which we have heard for the maxim, is, that it is aukward to ſee an engine go otherwiſe. But w <hi rend="italic">e</hi> doubt exceedingly the truth of this maxim, and, without being able to give any accurate determination, we think that the engine will do more work if the working ſtroke be made flower than the returning ſtroke. Suppoſe the engine ſo conſtructed that they are made in equal times ; an addition to the counter weight will accelerate the returning ſtroke and retard the working ſtroke. But as the counter-weight is but ſmall in proportion to the unbalanced portion of the atmoſpheric preſſure, which is the moving force of the machine, it is evident that this addition to the counter weight muſt bear a much greater proportion to the counter weight than it does to the moving force, and muſt therefore accelerate the returning ſtroke much more than it retards the working ſtroke, and the time of both ſtrokes taken together muſt be diminiſhed by this addition and the performance of the machine improved ; and this muſt be the cafe as long as the machine is not extravagantly loaded. The best machine which we have ſeen, in respect of performance, raiſes a column of water whoſe weight is very nearly 2/3ds of the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the piſton, making 11 ſtrokes of six feet each <hi rend="italic">per</hi> minute, and the working ſtroke was almoſt twice as flow as the other. This engine had worked pumps of 12 inches, which were changed for pumps of 14 inches, all other things remaining the ſame. In its former ſtate it made from 12½ to 13½ ſtrokes <hi rend="italic">per</hi> minute, the working ſtroke being conſiderably flower than the returning ſtroke. The load was encreaſed, by the change of the pumps, nearly in the proportion of 3 to 4. This had retarded the working ſtroke ; but the performance was evidently increaſed in the proportion of 3×13to4×11, or of 39 to 44. About 300 pounds were added to the counterweight, which increaſed the number of ſtrokes to more than 12 <hi rend="italic">per</hi> minute. No ſenſible change could be obſerved in the time of the working ſtroke. The performance was therefore increaſed in the proportion of 39 to 48. We have therefore no heſitation in ſaying, that the ſeemly equality of the two ſtrokes is a ſacrifice to fancy. The engineer who obſerves the working ſtroke to be flow, rears that his engine may be thought feeble and unequal to its work; a ſimilar notion has long miſſed him in the conſtruction of water-mills, eſpecially of overſhot mills ; and, even now, he is ſubmitting with heſitation and fear to the daily correction of experience.</p><p>It is needleſs to engage more deeply in ſcientiſic calculations in a ſubject where ſo many of the data are ſo very imperfectly underſtood.</p><p>We venture to recommend as a maxim of conſtruction (ſuppoſing always a large boiler and plentiful ſupply of pure ſteam unmixed with air), that the load of work be not leſs than 10 pounds for every ſquare inch of the piſton, and the counterweight ſo proportioned that the time of the returning ſtroke may not exceed 2/3ds of that of the working ſtroke. A ſerious objection may be made to this maxim, and it deserves mature conſideration. Such a load requires the utmoſt care of the machine, that no admiſſion be given to the common air ; and it precludes the poſſibility of its working in cafe the growth of water, or deepening the pit, ſhould make a greater load abſolutely neceſſary. Theſe conſiderations muſt be left to the prudence of the enginneer. The maxim now recommended relates only to the best actual performance of the engine.</p><p>Before quitting this machine, it will not be amiss to give ſome eaſy rules, sanctioned by ſucceſsful practice, for computing its performance. Theſe will enable any artiſt, who can go through ſimple calculations, to fuit the ſize of his engine to the talk which it is to perform.</p><p>The circumſtance on which the whole computation muſt be founded is the quantity of water which muſt be drawn in a minute and the depth of the mine ; and the performance which may be expected from a good engine is at leaſt 12 ſtrokes per minute of fix feet each, working againſt a column of water whoſe weight is equal to half of the atmoſpheric preſſure on the ſteam- piſton, or rather to 7,6'4 pounds on every ſquare inch of its ſurface.</p><p>It is moſt convenient to eſtimate the quantity of water in cubic feet, or its weight in pounds, recollecting that a cubic foot of water weighs <hi rend="italic">62</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> <hi rend="italic">/</hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> pounds. The depth of the pit- is uſually reckoned in fathoms of fix feet, and the diameter of the cylinder and pump is uſually reckoned in inches·.</p><p>Let Q be the quantity of water to be drawn per minute in cubical feet, and f the depth of the mine in fathoms; let <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the diameter of the cylinder, and p that of the pump ; and let us ſuppoſe the arms of the beam to be of equal length.</p><p>1st, To find the diameter of the pump, the area of 0,7854</p><p>the piſton in ſquare feet is p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x(0,7854/144) The length of the column drawn in one minute is 12 times 6 or 72 feet, and therefore its ſolid contents is p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (72x0,7854/144) cubical feet, or p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x0,3927 cubical feet. This muſt be equal to Q; therefore p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> muſt be Q/0,3927 or nearly Qx2½. Hence this practical rule: Multiply the cubic feet of water which muſt be drawn in a minute by 2½, and extract the ſquare root of the product : this will be the diameter of the pump in inches.</p><p>Thus ſuppoſe that 58 cubic feet muſt be drawn every minute ; 58 multiplied by 2½ gives 145, of which the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0766.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0760"/>
ſquare root is 12, which is the required diameter of the pump.</p><p>2. To find the proper diameter of the cylinder.</p><p>The piſton is to be loaded with 7,64 pounds on every ſquare inch. This is equivalent to six pounds on a circular inch very nearly. The weight of a cylinder of water an inch in diameter and a fathom in height is 2 1/24pounds, or nearly 2 pounds. Hence it follows that <hi rend="italic">6 c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> muſt be made equal to 2fp <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">c</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> is equal to 2fp <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /6, or to fp <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /3.</p><p>Hence the following rule : Multiply the ſquare of the diameter of the pump-piſton (found as above) by the fathoms of lift, and divide the product by 3, the ſquare root oſ the quotient is the diameter of the cylinder.</p><p>Suppoſe the pit to which the foregoing pump is to be applied is 24 fathoms deep ; then 24 x 144/3 gives 1152, of which the ſquare root is 34 inches very nearly.</p><p>This engine conſtructed with care will certainly do the work.</p><p>Whatever is the load of <hi rend="italic">water</hi> propoſed for the engine, let 10 be the pounds on every circular inch of the ſteam-piſton, and make c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x 2f/m and the ſquare root will be the diameter of the ſteam-piſton in inches.</p><p>To free the practical engineer as much as poſſible from all trouble of calculation, we ſubjoin the following <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Table</hi> <hi rend="italic">of the Dimensions and Power of the Steam Engine,</hi> drawn up by Mr Beighton in 1717, and fully verified by practice since that time.

In a line with this, under the depth of 50 yards, which is ⅛th of loo fathoms, we find 20⅛, the double of which 1341 inches for the diameter of the cylinder.</p><p>It is almoſt impoſſible to give a general rule for ſtrokes of different lengths, &amp;c. but any one who pro- feſſes the ability to erect an engine, ſhould ſurely know as much arithmetic as will accommodate the rule now given to any length of ſtroke.</p><p>We venture to ſay, that no ordinary engineer can tell <hi rend="italic">à priori</hi> the number per minute which an engine will give. We took ιz ſtrokes of fix feet each fora ſtandard, which a careful engineer may ealily accom- pliſh, and which an employer has a right to expect, the engine being loaded with <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> water to half the preſſure of the atmoſphere : if the load be leſs, there is ſome fault — an improper counter weight, or too little boiler, or leaks, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><p>Such is the ſtate in which Newcomen’s ſteam-engim· had continued in uſe for 60 years neglected by thepbi- loſopher, although it is the moſt curious object vzhich human ingenuity has yet offered to his contemplation, and abandoned to the efforts of the unlettered artiſt. Its uſe has been entirely confined to the raffing of water. Mr Keane Fitzgerald indeed publiſhed in the Philoſophi- cal T raiTſactions a method of converting its recipt ocating motion into a continued rotatory motion by employing the great beam to work a crank or a train of wheel-work. As the real action of the machine is confined to its working ſtroke, to accompliſh this, it became neceſſary to connect with the crank or wheeled work a very large and heavy fly, which ſhould accumulate in itſelf the whole pr eſſure of the machine during its time of action, and therefore continue in motion, and urge forward the working machinery while the ſteam engine was going through its inactive returning ſtroke. This will be the caie, provided that the refiſtance exerted by the working machine during the whole period of the working and returning ſtroke of the ſteam-engine, together<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0767.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0761"/>
with the friction of both, does not exceed the whole preſſure exerted by the ſteam-engine during its working ſtroke; and provided that the momentum of the fly, ariſing from its great weight and velocity, be very great, ſo that the reſiſtance of the work during one returning ſtroke of the ſteam engine do not make any very ſensible diminution of the velocity of the fly. This is evidently poſſible and eaſy. The fly may be made of any magnitude ; and being exactly balanced round its axis, it will ſoon acquire any velocity conſiſtent with the motion of the ſteam-engine. During the working ſtroke of the engine it is uniformly accelerated, and by its acquired momentum it produces in the beam the movement of the returning ſtroke; but in doing this, its momentum is ſhared with the inert matter of the ſteam-engine, and conſequently its velocity diminiſhed, but not entirely taken away. The next working ſtroke therefore, by preſſing on it afreſh, increaſes its remaining velocity by a quantity nearly equal to the whole that it acquired during the firſt ſtroke. We say <hi rend="italic">nearly,</hi> but not quite equal, becauſe the time of the second working ſtroke muſt be ſhorter than that of the firſt, on account of the velocity already in the machine. In this manner the fly will be more and more accelerated every ſucceeding ſtroke, becauſe the preſſure of the engine during the working ſtroke does more than reſtore to the fly the momentum which it loſt in producing the returning movement of the ſteam-engine. Now suppoſe the working part of the machine to be added. The acceleration of the fly during each working ſtroke of the ſteam-engine will be leſs than it was before, becauſe the impelling preſſure is now partly employed in driving the working machine, and becauſe the fly will lose more of its momentum during the returning ſtroke of the ſteam- engine, part of it being expended in driving the working machine. It is evident, therefore, that a time will come when the ſucceſſive augmentation of the fly’s velocity will ceaſe ; for, on the one hand, the continual acceleration diminiſhes the time of the next working ſtroke, and therefore the time of action of the accelerating power. The acceleration muſt diminiſh in the ſame proportion ; and on the other hand, the reſiſtance of the working machine generally, though not always, increaſes with its velocity. The acceleration ceaſes whenever the addition made to the momentum of the fly during a working ſtroke of the ſteam-engine is juſt equal to what it loſes by driving the machine, and by producing the returning movement of the ſteam-engine.</p><p>This muſt be acknowledged to be a very important addition to the engine, and though ſufficiently obvious, it is ingenious, and requires conſiderable ſkill and addreſs to make it effective<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> We do not recollect at preſent the date of this propoſal of Mr Fitzgerald ; but in 1781 the Abbé Arnal, canon of Alais in Languedoc, entertained a thought of the ſame kind, and propoſed it for working lighters in the inland navigations ; a ſcheme which has been ſucceſsfully practiſed (we are told) in America. His brother, a major of engineers in the Auſtrian ſervice, has carried the thing much farther, and applied <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to manufactures ; and the Aulic Chamber of Mines at Vienna has patronized the project : (See <hi rend="italic">Journal Encyclopedique,</hi> 1781). But theſe ſchemes are long poſterior to Mr Fitzgerald’s patent, and are even later than the erection of ſeveral machines driven by steam engines which have been erected by Meſſrs Watt and Boulton. We think it our duty to ſtate theſe particulars, becauſe it is very uſual for our neighbours on the continent to allume the credit of British inventions.</p></note> (<hi rend="smallcaps">b).</hi></p><p>The movement oſ the working machine, or mill of whatever kind, muſt be in ſome degree hobbling or unequal. But this may be made quite inſenſible, by making the fly exceedingly large, and dispoſing the greatest part of its weight in the rim. By theſe means its momentum may be made ſo great, that the whole force required for driving the mill and producing the returning movement of the engine may bear a very ſmall proportion to it. The diminution of its velocity will then be very trifling.</p><p>No counter weight is neceſſary here, becauſe the returning movement is produced by the inertia of the fly. A counter weight may, however, be employed, and ſhould be employed, viz. as much as will produce the returning movement of the ſteam-engine. It will do this better than the ſame force accumulated in the fly ; for this force muſt be accumulated in the fly by the intervention of rubbing parts, by which ſome of it is loſt ; and it muſt be afterwards returned to the engine with a ſimilar loss. But, for the ſame reaſon, it would be improper to make the counter weight alſo able to drive the mill during the returning ſtroke.</p><p>By this contrivance Mr Fitzgerald hoped to render the ſteam-engine of moſt extenſive uſe; and he, or others aſſociated with him, obtained a patent excluding all others from employing the ſteam-engine for turning a crank. They alſo publiſhed propoſals for erecting mills of all kinds driven by ſteam-engines, and ſtated very fairly their powers and their advantages. But their propoſals do not ſeem to have acquired the confidence of the public ; for we do not know of any mill ever having been erected under this patent.</p><p>The great obſtacle to this extenſive uſe of the ſteam- engine is the prodigious expenſe of fuel. An engine having a cylinder of four feet diameter, working night and day, conſumes about 3400 chaldron (London) of good coals in a year.</p><p>This circumſtance limits the uſe of ſteam-engines exceedingly. To draw water from coal-pits, where they can be flocked with unſaleable ſmall coal, they are of univerſal employment : alſo for valuable mines, for ſupplying a great and wealthy city with water, and a few other purpoſes where a great expence can be borne, they are very proper engines ; but in a thouſand caſes where their unlimited powers might be vaſtly ſerviceable, the enormous expenſes of fuel completely excludes them. We cannot doubt but that the attention of engineers was much directed to every thing that could promiſe a diminution of this expenſe. Every one had his particular noſtrum for the conſtruction of his furnace, and ſome were undoubtedly more ſucceſsful than others. But ſcience was not yet ſufficiently advanced : It was not till Dr Black had made his beautiful diſcovery of latent heat, that we could know the intimate relation between the heat expended in boiling off a quantity of water and the quantity of ſteam that is produced.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0768.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0762"/>
Mitch about the time of this diſcovery, viz. 1763, Mr James Watt, eſtabliſhed in Glaſgow in the commercial line, was amusing himſelf with repairing a working; model of the ſteam-engine which belonged to the philoſophical apparatus of the univerſity. Mr Watt was a perſon of a truly philoſophical mind, eminently converſant in all branches of natural knowledge, and the pupil and intimate friend of Dr Black. In the courſe of the above-mentioned amuſement many curious facts in the production and condenſation of steam occurred to him; and among others, that remarkable fact which is always appealed to by Dr Black as the proof of the immenſe quantity of heat which is contained in a very minute quantity of water in the form of elaſtic ſteam. When a quantity of water is heated ſeveral degrees above the boiling point in a cloſe digeſter, if a hole be opened, the ſteam ruſhes out with prodigious violence, and the heat of the remaining water is reduced, in the courſe of three or four seconds, to the boiling temperature. The water of the ſteam which has iſſued amounts only to a very few drops ; and yet theſe have carried off with them the whole exceſs of heat from the water in the digeſter.</p><p>Since then a certain quantity of ſteam contains ſo great a quantity of heat, it muſt expend a great quantity of fuel ; and no conduction of furnace can prevent this. Mr Watt thereſore ſet his invention to work to diſcover methods of husbanding this heat. The cylinder of his little model was heated almoſt in an inſtant, ſo that it could not be touched by the hand. It could not be otherwiſe, becauſe it condenſed the vapour by abſtracting its heat. But all the heat thus communicated to the cylinder, and waſted by it on ſurrounding bodies, contributed nothing to the performance of the engine, and muſt be taken away at every injection, and again communicated and waſted. Mr Watt quickly underſtood the whole proceſs which was going on within the cylinder, and which we have considered ſo minutely, and ſaw that a very conſiderable portion of the ſteam muſt be waſted in warming the cylinder. His first attempts were made to aſcertain how much was thus waſted, and he found that it was not leſs than three or four times as much as would fill the cylinder and work the engine. He attempted to diminiſh this waſte by uſing wooden cylinders. But though this produced a ſensible diminution of the waſte, other reasons forced him to give them up. He then caſed his metal cylinders in a wooden cafe with light wood aſhes between. By this, and uſing no more injection than was abſolutely neceſſary for the condenſation, he reduced the waſte almoſt one half. But by uſing ſo ſmall a quantity of cold, water, the inside of the cylinder was hardly brought below the boiling temperature ; and there conſequently remained in it a ſteam of very considerable elaſticity, which robbed the engine of a proportional part of the atmoſpherical preſſure. He ſaw that this was unavoidable as long as the condenſation was performed in the cylinder; The thought struck him to attempt the condenſation in another place. His firſt experiment was made in the simpleſt manner. A globular veſſel communicated by means of a long pipe of one inch diameter with the bottom of his little cylinder of four inches diameter and 30 inches long. This pipe had a ſtop-cock, and the globe was immerſed in a veſſel of cold , water. When the piſton was at the top, and the cylinder filled with ſtrong ſteam, he turned the cock. It was ſcarcely turned, nay he did not think it completely turned, when the ſides of his cylinder (only ſtrong tin-plate) were cruſhed together like an empty bladder. This ſurpriſed and delighted him. A new cylinder was immediately made of braſs ſufficiently thick, and nicely bored. When the experiment was repeated with this cylinder, the condenſation was ſo rapid, that he could not ſay that any time was expended in it. But the moſt valuable diſeovery was, that the vacuum in the cylinder was, as he hoped, almoſt perfect. Mr Watt found, that when he uſed water in the boiler purged of air by long boiling, nothing that was very ſenſibly inferior to the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the piſton could hinder it from coming quite down to the bottom of the cylinder. This alone was gaining a great deal, for in moſt engines the remaining elaſticity of the ſteam was not leſs than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of the atmoſpherical preſſure, and therefore took away <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of the power of the engine.</p><p>Having gained this capital point, Mr Watt found many difficulties to ſtruggle with before he could get the machine to continue its motion. The water produced from the condenſed ſteam, and the air which was extricated from it, or which penetrated through unavoidable leaks, behoved to accumulate in the condensing veſſel, and could not be voided in any way similar to that adopted in Newcomen’s engine. He took another method : He applied pumps to extract both, which were worked by the great beam. The contrivance is eaſy to any good mechanic ; only we muſt obſerve,that the piſton of the water-pump muſt be under the ſurface of the water in the condenſer, that the water may enter the pump by its own weight, becauſe there is no atmoſpherical preſſure there to force it in. We muſt alſo obſerve, that a conſiderable force is neceſſarily expended here, becauſe, as there is but one ſtroke for rarefying the air, and this rarefaction muſt be nearly complete, the air-pump muſt be of large dimenſions, and its piſton muſt act againſt the whole preſſure of the atmoſphere. Mr Watt, however, found that this force could be easily ſpared from his machine, already ſo much improved in reſpect of power.</p><p>Thus has the ſteam-engine received a very considerable improvement. The cylinder may be allowed to remain very hot ; nay, boiling hot, and yet the condenſation be completely performed. The only elaſtic ſteam that now remains is the ſmall quantity in the pipe of communication. Even this ſmall quantity Mr Watt at laſt got rid of, by admitting a ſmall jet of cold water up this pipe to meet the ſteam in its paſſage to the condenſer. This both cooled this part of the apparatus in a ſituation where it was not neceſſary to warm it again, and it quickened the condenſation. He found at laſt that the ſmall pipe of communication was of itſelf ſufficiently large for the condenſation, and that no ſeparate veſſel, under the name of condenſer, was neceſsary. This circumſtance ſhows the prodigious rapidity of the condenſation. We may add, that unleſs this had been the caſe, his improvement would have been vaſtly diminiſhed ; for a large condenſer would have required a much larger air-pump, which would have expended much of the power of the engine. By theſe means the vacuum below the piſton is greatly improved : for it will appear clear to any perſon who underſtands the ſubject, that as long as any part of the condenſer is<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0769.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0763"/>
kept of a low temperature, it will abſtract and condenſe the vapour from the warmer parts, till the whole acquires the elaſticity correſponding to the coldeſt part. By the ſame means much of the waſte is prevented, becauſe the cylinder is never cooled much below the boiling temperature. Many engines have been erected by Mr Watt in this form, and their performance gave uniuniversal ſatisfaction.</p><p>We have contented ourſelves with giving a very slight deſcription without a figure oſ this improved engine, becauſe we imagine it to be of very eaſy comprehenſion, and becauſe it is only a preparation ſor ſtill greater improvements, which, when underſtood, will at the ſame time leave no part of this more simple form unexplained.</p><p>During the progreſs of theſe improvements Mr Watt made many experiments on the quantity and denſity of the ſteam of boiling water. Theſe fully convinced him, that although he had greatly diminiſhed the waſte of ſteam, a great deal yet remained, and that the ſteam expended during the riſe of the piſton was at leaſt three times more than what would fill the cylinder. The cauſe of this was very apparent. In the ſubſequent deſcent of the piſton, covered with water much below the boiling temperature, the whole cylinder was neceſſarily cooled and expoſed to the air. Mr Watt’s fertile genius immediately ſuggeſted to him the expedient of employing the elaſticity of the ſteam from the boiler to impel the piſton down the cylinder, in place of the preſſure of the atmoſphere ; and thus he restored the engine to its first principles, making it an engine <hi rend="italic">really moved by steam.</hi> As this is a new epoch in its hiſtory, we ſhall be more particular in the deſcription ; at the ſame time ſtill reſtricting ourſelves to the eſſential circumſtances, and avoiding every peculiarity which is to be found in the prodigious varieties which Mr Watt has introduced into the machines which he has erected, every individual of which has been adapted to local circumſtances, or diverſified by the progreſs of Mr Watt’s improvements.</p><p>Let A (fig. 9.) repreſent the boiler. This has received great improvements from his complete acquaintance with the procedure of nature in the production of ſteam. In ſome of his engines the fuel has been placed in the midſt of the water, ſurrounded by an iron or copper veſſel, while the exterior boiler was made of wood, which tranſmits, and therefore waſtes the heat very slowly. In others, the flame not only plays round the whole outside, as in common boilers, but alſo runs along ſeveral flues which ate conducted through the midſt of the water. By ſuch contrivances the fire is applied to the water in a moſt extenſive ſurface, and for a long time, ſo as to impart to it the greateſt part of its heat. So ſkilfully was it applied in the Albion Mills, that although it was perhaps the largeſt engine in the kingdom, its unconſumed ſmoke was inferior to that of a very ſmall brew-houſe. In this second engine of Mr Watt, the top of the cylinder is ſhut up by a ſtrong metal plate <hi rend="italic">g h,</hi> in the middle of which is a collar or box of leathers <hi rend="italic">k</hi> l, formed in the uſual manner of a jackhead pump, through which the piſton rod P D, nicely turned and poliſhed, can move up and down, without allowing any air to paſs by its sides. From the dome of the boiler proceeds a large pipe B C I O Q, which, after reaching the cylinder with its horizontal part BC, deſcends parallel to its side, ſending off two branches, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> I M to the top of the cylinder, and O N to its bottom. At I is a puppet valve opening from below upwards. At L, immediately below this branch, there is a ſimilar valve, alſo opening from below upwards. The pipe deſcends to Q, near the bottom of a large ciſtern <hi rend="italic">c de f,</hi> filled with cold water conſtantly renewed. The pipe is then continued horizontally along the bottom of this ciſtern (but not in contact), and terminates at R in a large pump S T. The piſton S has clack valves opening upwards, and its rod S <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> paſſing through a collar of leathers at T, is ſuſpended by a chain to a ſmall arch head on the outer arm of the beam. There is a valve R in the bottom of this pump, as uſual, which opens when preſſed in the direction Q_R, and ſhuts againſt a contrary preſſure. This pump delivers its contents into another pump X Y, by means of the ſmall pipe <hi rend="italic">t</hi> X, which proceeds from its top. This second pump has a valve at X, and a clack in its piſton Z as uſual, and the piſton rod Z z is ſuſpended from another arch head on the outer arm of the beam. The two valves I and L are opened and ſhut by means of ſpanners and handles, which are put in motion by a plug frame, in the ſame manner as in Newcomen’s engine.</p><p>Laſtly, there may be obſerved a crooked pipe a <hi rend="italic">b o,</hi> which enters the upright pipe laterally a little above Q. This has a ſmall jet hole at o ; and the other end <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is conſiderably under the ſurface of the water of the condenſing ciſtern, is covered with a puppet valve <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> whoſe long ſtalk <hi rend="italic">v u</hi> riſes above the water, and may be railed or lowered by hand or by the plug beam. The valves R and X and the clacks in the pillons S and Z are opened or ſhut by the preſſures to which they are immediately expoſed.</p><p>This figure is not an exact copy of any of Mr Watt’s engines, but has its parts ſo diſpoſed that all may come diſtinctly into view, and exactly perform their various functions. It is drawn in its quieſcent poſition, the outer end of the beam preponderating by the counter weight, and the piſton P at the top of the cylinder, and the piſtons S and Z in their lowest ſituations.</p><p>In this ſituation let us ſuppoſe that a vacuum is (by any means) produced in all the ſpace below the piſton, the valve I being ſhut. It is evident that the valve R will alſo be ſhut, as alſo the valve <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Now let the valve I be opened. The ſteam from the boiler, as elaſtic as common air, will ruſh into the ſpace above the piſton, and will exert on it a preſſure as great as that of the atmoſphere. It will therefore preſs it down, raiſe the outer end of the beam, and cauſe it to perform the ſame work as an ordinary engine.</p><p>When the piſton P has reached the bottom of the cylinder, the plug frame ſhuts the valve I, and opens L. By ſo doing the communication is open between the top and bottom of the cylinder, and nothing hinders the ſteam which is above the piſton from going along the paſſage M L O N. The piſton is now equally affected on both sides by the ſteam, even though a part of it is continually condenſed by the cylinder, and in the pipe I O Q. Nothing therefore hinders the piston from being dragged up by the counter weight, which acts with its whole force, undiminiſhed by any remaining unbalanced elaſticity of ſteam. Here therefore this form of the engine has an advantage (and by no means<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0770.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0764"/>
a small one) over the common engines, in which a great part of the counter weight is expended in overcoming unbalanced atmoſpheric preſſure.</p><p>Whenever the piſton P arrives at the top of the cylinder, the valve L is shut by the plug frame, and the valves I and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> are opened. All the ſpace below the piſton is at this time occupied by the ſteam which came from the upper part of the cylinder. This being a little waſted by condenſation, is not quite a balance for the preſſure of the atmosphere. Therefore, during the aſcent of the piſton, the valve R was ſhut, and it remains ſo. When, therefore, the valve <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is opened, the cold water of the cistern muſt spout up through the hole o, and condenſe the ſteam. To this muſt be added the coldneſs of the whole pipe O Q_S. As faſt as it is condenſed, its place is ſupplied by ſteam from the lower part of the cylinder. We have already remarked, that this ſucceſſive condenſation is accompliſhed with aſtoniſhing rapidity. In the mean time, ſteam from the boiler preſſes on the upper ſurface of the piſton. It muſt therefore deſcend as before, and the engine muſt perform a second working ſtroke.</p><p>But in the mean time the injection water lies in the bottom of the pipe O Q R, heated to a considerable degree by the condenſation of the ſteam ; alſo a quantity of air has been diſengaged from it and from the water in the boiler. How is this to be diſcharged ?— This is the office of the pumps ST and XY.The capacity of ST is very great in proportion to the ſpace in which the air and water are lodged. When, therefore, the piſton S has got to the top of its courſe, there muſt be a vacuum in the barrel of this pump, and the water and air muſt open the valve R and come into it. When the piſton S comes down again in the next returning ſtroke, this water and air gets through the valve of the piston ; and in the next working ſtroke they are diſcharged by the piſton into the pump XY, and raiſed by its piſton. The air eſcapes at Y, and as much of the water as is neceſſary is delivered into the boiler by a ſmall pipe Y y to ſupply its waſte. It is a matter of indifference whether the pillons S and Z. rise with the outer or inner end of the beam, but it is rather better that they riſe with the inner end. They are otherwiſe drawn here, in order to detach them from the rest and ,ſhow them more diſtinctly.</p><p>Such is Mr Watt’s ſecond engine. Let us examine its principles, that we may ſee the cauſes of its avowed and great ſuperiority over the common engines.</p><p>We have already ſeen one ground of superiority, the full operation of the counter weight. We are authorized by careful examination to ſay, that in the common engines at leaſt one-half of the counter weight is expended in counteracting an unbalanced preſſure of the air on the piſton during its aſcent. In many engines, which are not the worst, this extends to 1/5th of the whole preſſure. This is evident from the examination of the engine at Montrelais by Bossut. This makes a very great counter weight neceſſary, which exhauſts a proportional part of the moving force.</p><p>But the great advantage of Mr Watt’s form is the almoſt total annihilation of the waſte of ſteam by condenſation in the cylinder. The cylinder is always boiling hot, and therefore perfectly dry. This muſt be evident to any perſon who underſtands the ſubject. By the time that Mr Watt had completed his improvements, his experiments on the production of ſteam had given him a pretty accurate knowledge of its denſity ; and he found himſelf authorized to ſay, that the quantity of ſteam employed did not exceed twice as much as would fill the cylinder, ſo that not above one-half was unavoidably waſted. But before he could bring the engine to this degree of perfection, he had many difficulties to overcome : He incloſed the cylinder in an outer wooden caſe at a ſmall diſtance from it. This diminiſhed the expence of heat by communication to ſurrounding bodies. Sometimes he allowed the ſteam from the boiler to occupy this interval. This undoubtedly prevented all diſſipation from the inner cylinder : but in its turn it diſſipated much heat by the outer caſe, and a very ſenſible condensation was obſerved between them. This has occaſioned him to omit this circumſtance in ſome of his beſt engines. We believe it was omitted in the Albion Mills.</p><p>The greateſt difficulty was to make the great piſton tight. The old and effectual method, by water lying on it, was inadmiſſible. He was therefore obliged to have his cylinders moſt nicely bored, perfectly cylindrical, and finely poliſhed; and he made numberleſs trials of different soft ſubſtances for packing his piſton, which ſhould be tight without enormous friction, and which ſhould long remain so, in a ſituation perfectly dry, and hot almoſt to burning.</p><p>After all that Mr Watt has done in this reſpect, he thinks that the greateſt part of the waſte of ſteam which he ſtill perceives in his engines ariſes from the unavoidable eſcape by the ſides of the piſton during its deſcent.</p><p>But the fact is, that an engine of this conſtruction, of the ſame dimenſions with a common engine, making the ſame number of ſtrokes of the ſame extent, does not conſume above one fourth part of the fuel that is con fumed by the beſt engines of the common form. It is alſo a very fortunate circumflante, that the performance of the engine is not immediately deſtroyed, nor indesed ſenſibly diminiſhed, by a ſmall want of tightneſs in the piſton. In the common engine, if air get, in, in this way, it immediately puts a stop to the work ; but although even a conſiderable quantity of ſteam get paſt the piſton during its deſcent, the rapidity of condenſation is ſuch, that hardly any diminution of preſſure can be obſerved, and the waſte of ſteam is the only inconvenience.</p><p>Mr Watt’s penetration ſoon diſcovered another moſt valuable property of this engine. When an engine of the common form is erected, the engineer muſt make an accurate eſtimate of the work to be performed, and muſt proportion his engine accordingly. He muſt be careful that it be f <hi rend="italic">ully</hi> able to execute its taſk ; but its power muſt not exceed its load in any extravagant degree. This would produce a motion which is too rapid, and which, being alternately in oppoſite directions, would occaſion jolts which no building or machinery could withſtand. Many engines have been ſhattered by the pumps drawing air, or a pump-rod breaking ; by which accidents the ſteam-piſton deſcends with ſuch rapidity that every thing gives way. But in moſt operations of mining, the taſk of the engine increaſes, and it muſt be ſo constructed at firſt as to be able to bear this addition. It is very difficult to manage an engine that is much ſuperior to its taſk; and die easieſt way is,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0771.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0765"/>
to have it almoſt full loaded, and to work it only during a few hours each day, and allow the pit water to accumulate during its repoſe. This increaſes the first cost, and waſtes fuel during the inaction of the engine.</p><p>But this new engine can at all times be exactly fitted (at leaſt during the working ſtroke) to the load of work that then happens to be on it. We have only to adminiſter ſteam of a proper elaſticity. At the first erection the engine may be equal to twice its taſk, if the ſteam admitted above the cylinder be equal to that of common boiling water ; but when once the ebullition is fairly commenced, and the whole air expelled from all parts of the apparatus, it is evident, that by damping the fire, ſteam of half this elaſticity may be continually ſupplied, and the water will continue boiling although its temperature does not exceed 185⁰ of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. This appears by inſpecting our table of vaporous elaſticity, and affords another argument for rendering that table more accurate by new experiments. We hope that Mr Watt will not withhold from the public the knowledge which he has acquired on this ſubject. It may very poſſibly reſult from an accurate inveſtigation, that it would be advisable to work our ſteam-engines with weak ſteams, and that the diminution of work may be more than compenſated by the diminution of fuel. It is more probable indeed, and it is Mr Watt’s opinion, that the contrary is the caſe, and that it is much more economical to employ great heats. At any rate, the deciſion of this queſtion is of great importance for improving the engine ; and we ſee, in the mean time, that the engine can at all times be fitted ſo as to perform its taſk with a moderate and manageable motion, and that as the taſk increaſes we can increaſe the power of the engine.</p><p>But the method now proposed has a great inconvenience. While the ſteam is weaker than the atmoſphere, there is an external force tending to ſqueeze in the ſides and bottom of the boiler. This could not be reſiſted when the difference is conſiderable, and common air would ruſh in through every crevice of the boiler and ſoon choke the engine : it muſt therefore be given up.</p><p>But the ſame effect will be produced by drminiſhing the paſſage for the ſteam into the cylinder. For this purpoſe, the puppet valve by which the ſteam enters the cylinder was made in the form of a long taper ſpigot, and it was lodged in a cone of the ſame ſhape ; conſequently the paſſage could be enlarged or contracted at pleaſure by the diſtance to which the inner cone was drawn up.</p><p>In this way ſeveral engines were conſtructed, and the general purpoſe of suiting the power of the engine to its taſk was completely answered ; but ( as the mathematical reader will readily perceive) it was extremely difficult to make this adjuſtment preciſe and confiant. In a great machine like this, going by jerks, it was hardly poſſible that every ſucceſſive motion of the valve ſhould be preciſely the same. This occaſioned very ſenſible irregularities in the motion of the engine, which increaſed and became hazardous when the joints worked looſe by long uſe.</p><p>Mr Watt’s genius, always fertile in reſources, found out a complete remedy for all theſe inconveniences. Making the valve of the ordinary form of a puppet clack, he adjuſted the button oſ its ſtalk or tail io that it ſhould always open full to the ſame height. He then regulated the pins of the plug-frame, in ſuch a manner that the valve ſhould ſhut the moment that the piſton had deſcended a certain proportion (ſuppoſe one-fourth, one-third, one-half, &amp;c. ) of the cylinder. So far the cylinder was occupied by ſteam as elaſtic as common air. In preſſing the piſton farther down, it behoved the ſteam to expand, and its elaſticity to diminiſh. It is plain that this could be done in any degree we pleaſe, and that the adjuſtment can be varied in a minute, according to the exigency of the caſe, by moving the plug pins.</p><p>In the mean time, it muſt be obſerved, that the preſſure on the piſton is continually changing, and consequently the accelerating force. The motion therefore will no longer be uniformly accelerated : it will approach much faſter to uniformity ; nay, it may be retarded, becauſe although the preſſure on the piſton at the beginning of the ſtroke may exceed the reſiſtance of the load, yet when the piſton is near the bottom the resiſtance may exceed the preſſure. Whatever may be the law by which the preſſure on the piſton varies, an ingenious mechanic may contrive the connecting machinery in ſuch a way that the chains or rods at the outer end of the beam ſhall continually exert the ſame preſsure, or ſhall vary their preſſure according to any law he finds moſt convenient. It is in this manner that the watchmaker, by the form of the fuzee, produces an equal preſſure on the wheel-work by means of a very unequal action of the main-ſpring. In like manner, by making the outer arch heads portions of a proper ſpiral inſtead of a circle, we can regulate the force of the beam at pleaſure.</p><p>Thus we ſee how much more manageable an engine is in this form than Newcomen’s was, and alſo more eaſily inveſtigated in reſpect of its power in its various poſitions. The knowledge of this laſt circumſtance was of mighty conſequence, and without it no notion could be formed of what it could perform. This ſuggeſted to Mr Watt the uſe of the barometer communicating with the cylinder ; and by the knowledge acquired by theſe means has the machine been ſo much improved by its ingenious inventor.</p><p>We muſt not omit in this place one deduction made by Mr Watt from his obſervations, which may be called a diſcovery of great importance in the theory of the engine.</p><p>Let ABCD (fig. 10.) repreſent a ſection of the cylinder of a ſteam-engine, and EF the ſurface of its piſton. Let us ſuppoſe that the ſteam was admitted while EF was in contact with AB, and that as ſoon as it had preſſed it down to the ſituation EF the ſteam cock is ſhut. The ſteam will continue to press it down, and as the ſteam expands its preſſure diminiſhes, We may expreſs its pressure (exerted all the while the piſton moves from the ſituation AB to the ſituation EF) by the line EF. If we ſuppoſe the elaſticity of the ſteam proportional to its denſity, as is nearly the caſe with air, we may express the preſſure on the piſton in any other poſition, ſuch as KL or DC, by K7 and D <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the ordinates of a rectangular hyperbola F l <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> of which AE, A B are the aſsymptotes, and A the centre. The accumulated preſſure during the motion of the piſton from EF to DC will be expreſſed by the area EF <hi rend="italic">c</hi> DE, and the preſſure during the whole motion by the area ABF <hi rend="italic">c</hi> DA,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0772.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0766"/>
Now it is well known that the area EF <hi rend="italic">e</hi> DE is equal to ABFE multiplied by the hyperbolic logarithm of AD/AE, = L. AD/AE, and the whole area ABFc DA is = ABFE x (1 + L. AD/AE). Thus let the diameter of the piſton be 24 inches, and the preſſure of the atmoſphere on a ſquare inch be 14 pounds ; the preſſure on the piſton is 6333 pounds. Let the whole ſtroke be 6 feet, and let the ſteam be ſtopped when the piſton has deſcended 18 inches, or <hi rend="italic">1,5</hi> feet. The hyperbolic logarithm of 6/1,5 is 1,3862943. Therefore the accumulated preſſure ABF <hi rend="italic">c</hi> DA is = 6333 × 2,3862943, = 15114 pounds.</p><p>As few profeſſional engineers are posseſſed of a table of hyperbolic logarithms, while tables of common logarithms are or ſhould be in the hands of every perſon who is much engaged in mechanical calculations, let the following method be practiſed. Take the common logarithm of AD/AE, multiply it by 2,3026 ; the product is the hyperbolic logarithm of AD/AE. The accumulated preſſure while the piſton moves from AB to EF is 6333 × 1, or simply 6333 pounds. Therefore the ſteam while it expands into the whole cylinder adds a preſſure of 8781 pounds.</p><p>Suppoſe that the ſteam had got free admiſſion during the whole deſcent of the piſton, the accumulated presſure would have been 6333 × 4, or 25332 pounds.</p><p>Here Mr Watt obſerved a remarkable reſult. The ſteam expended in this caſe would have been four times greater than when it was ſtopped at 1/4th, and yet the accumulated preſſure is not twice as great, being nearly <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ds. One-fourth of the ſteam performs nearly 3/5ths of the work, and an equal quantity performs more than twice as much work when thus admitted during 1/4th of the motion.</p><p>This is a curious and an important information, and the advantage of this method of working a steam-engine increaſes in proportion as the ſteam is ſooner ſtopped ; but the increaſe is not great after the ſteam is rarefied four times. The curve approaches near to the axis, and ſmall additions are made to the area. The expenſe of ſuch great cylinders is considerable, and may Sometimes compenſate this advantage.</p><table> <row> <cell>Let the fleam be flopped at</cell> <cell>Its performance is mult.</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/2</cell> <cell>1,7</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/3</cell> <cell>2,1</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/4</cell> <cell>2,4</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/5</cell> <cell>2,6</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/6</cell> <cell>• 2,8</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/7</cell> <cell>3,</cell> </row> <row> <cell>1/8</cell> <cell>3,2</cell> </row> <row> <cell>&amp;C.</cell> <cell>&amp;c.</cell> </row> </table><p>It is very pleaſing to obſerve ſo many unlooked- for advantages reſulting from an improvement made with the ſole view of leſſening the waſte of steam by condenſation. While this purpoſe is gained, we learn how to husband the ſteam which is not thus wasted. The engine becomes more manageable, and is more eaſily adapted to every variation in its taſk, and all its powers are more eaſily computed.</p><p>The active mind of its ingenious inventor did not stop here : It had always been matter of regret that one-half of the motion was unaccompanied by any work. It was a very obvious thing to Mr Watt, that as the ſteam admitted above the piſton preſſed it down, ſo ſteam admitted below the piſton preſſed it up with the ſame force, provided that a vacuum were made on its upper side. This was eaſily done, by connecting the lower end of the cylinder with the boiler and the upper end with the condenſer.</p><p>Fig. 11. is a repreſentation of this conſtruction exactly copied from Mr Watt’s figure accompanying his ſpecification. Here BB is a ſection of the cylinder, ſurrounded at a ſmall diſtance by the caſe 1111. The ſection of the piſton A, and the collar of leathers which embraces the piſton rod, gives a diſtinct notion of its conſtruction, of the manner in which it is connected with the piston-rod, and how the packing of the piſton and collar contributes to make all tight.</p><p>From the top of the cylinder proceeds the horizontal pipe. Above the letter D is obſerved the seat of the ſteam valve, communicating with the box above it. In the middle of this may be obſerved a dark ſhaded circle. This is the mouth of the upper branch of the ſteam pipe coming from the boiler. Beyond D, below the letter N, is the ſeat of the upper condenſing valve. The bottom of the cylinder is made ſpherical, fitting the piſton, ſo that they may come into entire contact. Another horizontal pipe proceeds from this bottom. Above the letter E is the ſeat of the lower steam valve, opening into the valve box. This box is at the extremity of another ſteam pipe marked C, which branches off from the upper horizontal part, and deſcends obliquely, coming forward to the eye. The lower part is repreſented as cut open, to ſhow its interior conformation. Beyond this steam valve, and below the letter F, may be obſerved the ſeat of the lower condenſing valve. A pipe deſcends from hence, and at a ſmall distance below unites with another pipe GG, which comes down from the upper condenſing valve N. Theſe two eduction-pipes thus united go downwards, and open at L into a rectangular box, of which the end is ſeen at L. This box goes backward from the eye, and at its farther extremity communicates with the air pump K, whoſe piston is here repreſented in ſection with its butterfly valves. The piſton delivers the water and air laterally into another rectangular box M, darkly ſhaded, which box communicates with the pump I. The piſton-rods of this and of the air-pump are ſuſpended by chains from a ſmall arch head on the inner arm of the great beam. The lower part of the eduction-pipe, the horizontal box L, the air-pump K, with the communicating box M between it and the pump I, are all immerſed in the cold water of the condensing ciſtern. The box L is made flat, broad, and shallow, in order to increaſe its ſurface and accelerate the condenſation. But that this may be performed with the greateſt expedition, a ſmall pipe H, open below (but occasionally ſtopped by a plug valve), is inſerted laterally into the eduction-pipe G, and then divides into two branches ; one of which reaches within a foot or two of the upper valve N, and the other approaches as near to the valve F.</p><p>As it is intended by this conſtruction to give the piston a ſtrong impulſe in both directions, it will not be<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0773.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0767"/>
proper to ſuſpend its rod by a chain from the great beam ; for it muſt not only pull down that end of the beam, but alſo puſh it upwards. It may indeed be ſuſpended by double chains like the piſtons of the engines for extinguiſhing fires; and Mr Watt has accordingly done ſo in ſome of his engines. But in his drawing from which this figure is copied, he has communicated the force of the piſton to the beam by means of a toothed rack OO, which engages or works in the toothed ſector QQ on the end of the beam. The reader will underſtand, without any farther explanation, how the impulſe given to the piſton in either direction is thus transmitted to the beam without diminution. The fly XX, with its pinion Y, which alſo works in the toothed arch QQ, may be ſuppoſed to be removed for the preſent, and will be conſidered afterwards.</p><p>We ſhall take the preſent opportunity of deſcribing Mr Watt’s method <hi rend="italic">of</hi> communicating the force of the ſteam-engine to any machine of the rotatory kind. VV repreſents the rim and arms of a very large and heavy metalline fly. On its axis is the concentric toothed wheel U. There is attached to the end of the great beam a ſtrong and ſtiff rod TT, to the lower end of which a toothed wheel W is firmly fixed by two bolts, ſo that it cannot turn round. This wheel is of the ſame size and in the ſame vertical plane with the wheel U ; and an iron link or ſtrap (which cannot be ſeen here, becauſe it is on the other side of the two wheels) connects the centres of the two wheels, ſo that the one cannot quit the other. The engine being in the position repreſented in the figure, suppoſe the fly to be turned once round by any external force in the direction of the darts. It is plain, that since the toothed wheels cannot quit each other, being kept together by the link, the inner half (that is, the half next the cylinder) of the wheel U will work on the inner half of the wheel W, ſo that at the end of the revolution of the fly the wheel W muſt have got to the top of the wheel U, and the outer end of the beam muſt be raiſed to its higheſt position. The next revolution of the fly will bring the wheel W and the beam connected with it to their firſt positions ; and thus every two revolutions of the fly will make a complete period of the beam’s reciprocating movements. Now, inſtead oſ ſupposing the fly to drive the beam, let the beam drive the fly. The motions muſt be perfectly the ſame, and the aſcent or deſcent of the piſton will produce one revolution of the fly.</p><p>A side view of this apparatus is given in fig 12. marked by the ſame letters of reference. This ſhows the ſituation of parts which were fore-ſhortened in fig. 11, particularly the deſcending branch C of the ſteam pipe, and the ſituation and communications of the two pumps K and I. 8, 8 is the horizontal part oſ the ſteam pipe. 9 is a part of it whoſe box is repreſented by the dark circle of fig. 11. D is the box of the ſteam clack, and the little circle at its corner repreſents the end of the axis which turns it, as will be described afterwards. N is the place of the upper eduction valve. A part only of the upper eduction-pipe G is repreſented, the rest being cut off, becauſe it would have covered. the deſcending ſteam pipe CC. When continued down, it comes between the eye and the box E of the lower ſteam valve, and the box F of the lower eduction valve.</p><p>Let us now trace the operation of this machine through all its ſteps. Recurring to fig. 11, let us ſuppoſe that the lower part of the cylinder BB is exhauſted of all elaſtic fluids; that the upper ſteam valve D and the lower eduction valve F are open, and that the lower ſteam valve E and upper eduction valve N are ſhut. It is evident that the piſton muſt be preſſed toward the bottom of the cylinder, and muſt pull down the end of the working beam by means of the toothed rack OO and ſector QQ cauſing the other end of the beam to urge forward the machinery with which it is connected. When the piſton arrives at the bottom of the cylinder, the valves D and F are ſhut by the plug frame, and E and N are opened. By this laſt paſſage the ſteam gets into the eduction-pipe, where it meets with the injection water, and is rapidly condenſed. The ſteam from the boiler enters at the ſame time by E, and preſſing on the lower side of the piſton, forces it upwards, and by means of the toothed rack OO and toothed ſector QQ forces up that end of the working beam, and cauſes the other end to urge forward the machinery with which it is connected : and in this manner the operation of the engine may be continued for ever.</p><p>The injection water is continually running into the eduction-pipe, becauſe condenſation is continually going on, and therefore there is a continual atmoſpheric preſſure to produce a jet. The air which is diſengaged from the water, or enters by leaks, is evacuated only during the riſe of the piſton of the air-pump K. When this is very copious, it renders a very large air-pump neceſſary ; and in ſome ſituations Mr Watt has been obliged to employ two air-pumps, one worked by each arm of the beam. This in every caſe expends a very conſiderable portion of the power, for the air-pump is always working againſt the whole preſſure of the atmoſphere.</p><p>Is is evident that this form of the engine, by maintaining an almoſt conſtant and uninterrupted impulſion, is much fitter for driving any machinery of continued motion than any of the former engines, which were inactive during half of their motion. It does not, however, ſeem to have this ſuperiority when employed to draw water ; But it is equally fitted for this task. Let the engine be loaded with twice as much as would be proper for it if a single ſtroke engine, and let a fly be connected with it. Then it is plain that the power of the engine during the riſe of the ſteam piſton will be accumulated in the fly; and this, in conjunction with the power of the engine during the deſcent of the ſteam piſton, will be equal to the whole load of water.</p><p>In ſpeaking of the ſteam and eduction-valves, we ſaid that they were all puppet valves. Mr Watt employed cocks, and alſo sliding valves, ſuch as the regulator or ſteam-valve, and the old engines. But he found them always loſe their tightneſs after a ſhort time. This is not ſurpriſing, when we conſider that they are always perfectly dry, and almoſt burning hot. He was therefore obliged to change them all for puppet clacks, which, when truly ground and nicely fitted in their motions at firſt, are not found to go out of order by any length of time. Other engineers now universally uſe them in the old form of the ſteam-engine, without the ſame. reaſons, and merely by ſervile and ignorant imitation.</p><p>The way in which Mr Watt opens and ſhuts theſe valves is as follows. Fig. 13. repreſents a clack with<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0774.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0768"/>
its ſeat and box. Suppoſe it one of the eduction valves. RH is part of the pipe which introduces the ſteam, and GG is the upper part of the pipe which communicates with the condenſer. At EE maybe obſerved a piece more faintly ſhaded than the ſurrounding parts. This is the ſeat of the valve, and is a braſs or bell-metal ring turned conical on the outſide, ſo as to fit exactly into a conical part of the pipe GG. Theſe two pieces are fitted by grinding; and the cone being of a long taper, the ring flicks firmly in it, eſpecially after having been there for ſome time and united by ruſt. The clack itſelf is a ſtrong braſs plate D, turned conical on the edge, ſo as to fit the conical or ſtoping inner edge of the ſeat. Theſe are very nicely ground on each other with emery. This conical joining is much more obtuſe than the outer side of the ring ; ſo that although the joint is air-tight, the two pieces do not ſtick ſtrongly together. The clack has a round tail DG, which is freely moveable up and down in the hole of a croſs piece FF, On the upper side of the valve is a ſtrong piece of metal DC firmly joined to it, one side of which is formed into a toothed rack. A is the ſection of an iron axle which turns in holes in the oppoſite sides of the valve-box, where it is nicely fitted by grinding, ſo as to be air-tight. Collets of thick leather., well ſoaked in melted tallow and roſin, are ſcrewed on the outſide of theſe holes to prevent all ingreſs of air. One end of this axis projects a good way without the box, and carries a ſpanner or handle, which is moved by the plug-frame. To this axis is fixed a ſtrong piece of metal B, the edge of which is formed into an arch of a circle having the axis A in its centre, and is cut into teeth, which work in the teeth of the rack DC. K is a cover which is fixed by ſcrews to the top of the box H J J H, and may be taken off in order to get at the valve when it needs repairs.</p><p>From this deſcription it is eaſy to see that by turning the handle which is on the axis A, the ſector B muſt lift up the valve by means of its toothed rack DC, till the upper end of the rack touch the knob or button K. Turning the handle in the oppoſite direction brings the valve down again to its ſeat.</p><p>This valve is extremely tight. But in order to open it for the passage of the ſteam, we muſt exert a force equal to the preſſure of the atmoſphere. This in a large engine is a very great weight. A valve of six inches diameter ſuſtains a preſſure not leſs than 400 pounds. But this force is quite momentary, and hardly impedes the motion of the engine ; for the inſtant the valve is detached from its ſeat, although it has not moved the tooth part of an inch, the preſſure is over. Even this little inconvenience has been removed by a delicate thought of Mr Watt. He has put the ſpanner in ſuch a poſition when it <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to raiſe the valve, that its mechanical energy is almoſt infinitely great. Let Q_R (fig. 14.) be part of the plug-frame deſcending, and P one of its pins just going to lay hold of the ſpanner N O moveable round the axis N. On the ſame axis is another arm NM connected by a joint with the leader ML, which is connected alſo by a joint with the ſpanner L A that is on the axis A of the ſector within the valve-box. Therefore when the pin P puſhes down the ſpanner NO, the arm N M moves ſidewiſe and pulls down the ſpanner A L by means of the connecting rod. Things are ſo dispoſed, that when the cock is ſhut, L M and MN are in one ſtraight line. The intelligent mechanic will perceive that, in this poſition, the force of the lever O N M is inſuperable. It has this further advantage, that if any thing ſhould tend to force open the valve, it would be ineffectual ; for no force exerted at A, and tranſmitted by the rod L M, can possibly puſh the joint M out of its poſition. Of ſuch importance is it to practical mechanics, that its professors ſhould be perſons of penetration as well as knowledge. Yet this circumſtance is unheeded by hundreds who have ſervilely copied from Mr Watt, as may be ſeen in every engine that is passed on the public as a discovery and an improvement. When theſe puppet valves have been introduced into the common engine, we have not ſeen one inſtance where this has been attended to ; certainly becauſe its utility has not been obſerved : and there is one ſituation where it is of more conſequence than in Mr Watt’s engine, viz. in the injection-cock. Here the valve is drawn back into a box, where the water is ſo awkwardly diſpoſed round it that it can hardly get out of its way, and where the preſſure even exceeds that of the atmoſphere. Indeed this particular ſubſtitution of the button-valve for the cock is moſt injudicious.</p><p>We poſtponed any account of the office of the fly X X (fig. 11. ), as it is not of uſe in an engine regulated by the fly V V. The fly X X is only for regulating the reciprocating motion of the beam when the ſteam is not admitted during the whole deſcent of the piſton. This it evidently muſt render more uniform, accumulating a momentum equal to the whole preſſure of the full ſupply of ſteam, and then ſharing it with the beam during the rest of the deſcent of the piſton.</p><p>When a perſon properly ſkilled in mechanics and chemiſtry reviews theſe different forms of Mr Watt’s ſteam-engine, he will eaſily perceive them ſuſceptible of many intermediate forms, in which any one or more of the diſtinguiſhing improvements may be employed. The first great improvement was the condenſation in a ſeparate veſſel. This increaſed the original powers of the engine, giving to the atmoſpheric preſſure and to the counter weight their full energy ; at the ſame time the waſte of ſteam is greatly diminiſhed. The next improvement by employing the preſſure of the ſteam instead of that of the atmoſphere, aimed only at a ſtill farther diminution of the waſte ; but was fertile in advantages’, rendering the machine more manageable, and particularly enabling us at all times, and without trouble, to suit the power of the engine to its load of work, however variable and increaſing ; and brought into view a very intereſting propoſition in the mechanical theory of the engine, viz. that the whole performance of a, given quantity of ſteam may be augmented by admitting it into the cylinder only during a part of the piſton’s motion. Mr Watt has varied the application of this propoſition in a thouſand ways ; and there is nothings about the machine which gives more employment to the ſagacity and judgment of the engineer. The third improvement of the double impulſe may be conſidered as the finiſhing touch given to the engine, and renders it as uniform in its action as any water-wheel. In the engine in its moſt perfect form there does not ſeem to be above one-fourth of the ſteam wasted by warming the apparatus ; ſo that <hi rend="italic">it is not poſſible</hi> to make it one-fourth part more powerful than it is at preſent. The only thing that ſeems ſuſceptible of conſiderable improvement<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0775.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0769"/>
is the great beam. The enormous ſtrains exerted on its arms require a proportional ſtrength. This requires a vaſt maſs of matter, not leſs indeed in an engine with a cylinder of 54 inches than three tons and a half, moving with the velocity oſ three feet in a second, which muſt be communicated in about half a ſecond. This maſs muſt be brought into motion from a ſtate of reſt, muſt again be brought to rest, again into motion, and again to rest, to complete the period of a ſtroke. This confirmes much power ; and Mr Watt has not been able to load an engine with more than 10 or it pounds on the inch and preſerve a sufficient quantity of motion, ſo as to make 12 or 15 six-feet ſtrokes in a ſecond. Many attempts have been made to leſſen this maſs by tiling a light framed wheel, or a light frame of carpentry, in place of a ſolid beam. These have generally been conſtructed by persons ignorant of the true ſcientific principles of carpentry, and have fared accordingly. Mr Watt has made similar attempts ; but found·, that although at firſt they were abundantly ſtrong, yet after a ſhort time’s employment the ſtraps and bolts with which the wooden parts were connected cut their way into the wood, and the framing grew looſe in the joints, and, without giving any warning, went to pieces in an inſtant. A ſolid massy simple beam, of sufficient ſtrength, bends, and ſensibly complains (as the carpenters expreſs it), before it breaks. In all great engines, therefore, ſuch only are employed, and in ſmaller engines he ſometimes uses caſt-iron wheels or pulleys; nay, he frequently uſes no beam or equivalent whatever, but employs the ſteam piſton-rod to drive the machinery to which the engine is applied.</p><p>We preſume that our thinking readers will not be diſpleaſed with this rational hiſtory of the progreſs of this engine in the hands of its ingenious and worthy inventor. We owe it to the communications of a friend, well acquainted with him, and able to judge of his merits. The public ſee him always aſſociated with the no leſs celebrated mechanic and philoſopher Mr Boulton of Soho near Birmingham (ſee Sono). They have ſhared the royal patent from the beginning ; and the alliance is equally honourable to both.</p><p>The advantages derived from the patent-right ſhow both the ſuperiority of the engine and the liberal minds of the proprietors. They erect the engines at the expence of the employers, or give working drafts of all the parts, with inſtructions, by which any relident engineer may execute the work. The employers ſelect the beſt engine of the ordinary kind in the kingdom, compare the quantities of fuel expended by each, and pay to Meſſrs Watt and Boulton one-third of the annual ſavings for a certain term of years. By this the patentees are excited to do their utmoſt to make the engine perfect ; and the employer pays in proportion to the advantage he derives from it.</p><p>It may not be here improper to ſtate the actual performance of ſome of theſe engines, as they have been aſcertained by experiment.</p><p>An engine having a cylinder of 31 inches in diameter, and making 17 double ſtrokes per minute, performs the work of forty horſes working night and day (for which three relays or 120 horſes muſt be kept), and burns 11,000 pounds of Staffordſhire coal <hi rend="italic">per</hi> day. A cylinder of 19 inches, making 25 ſtrokes of 4 feet each per minute, performs the work of 12 horſes working conſtantly, and burns 3700 pounds of coals <hi rend="italic">per</hi> day. A cylinder of 24 inches, making 22 ſtrokes of 5 feet, burns 5 500 pounds of coals, and is equivalent to the conſtant work of 20 horſes. And the patentees think themſelves authorized by experience to ſay in general, that theſe engines will raile more than 20,000 cubic feet of water 24 feet high for every hundred weight of good pit-coal confirmed by them.</p><p>In conſequence of the great ſuperiority of Mr Watt’s engines, both with reſpect to economy and manageableneſs, they have become of moſt extenſive uſe ; and in every demand of manufacture on a great ſcale they offer us an indefatigable servant, whoſe ſtrength has no bounds. The greateſt mechanical project that ever engaged the attention of man was on the point of being executed by this machine. The States of Holland were treating with Messrs Watt and Boulton for draining the Haerlem Meer, and even reducing the Zuyder Zee : and we doubt not but that it will be accompliſhed whenever that unhappy nation has ſufficiently felt the difference between liberty and democratic tyranny. Indeed ſuch unlimited powers are afforded by this engine, that the engineer now thinks that no taſk can be propoſed to him which he cannot execute with profit to his employer.</p><p>No wonder then that all claſſes of engineers have turned much of their attention to this engine; and seeing that it has done ſo much, that they try to make it do ſtill more. Numberleſs attempts have been made to improve Mr Watt’s engine ; and it would occupy a volume to give an account of them, whilſt that account would do no more than indulge curioſity. Our engineers by profeſſion are in general miſerably deficient in that accurate knowledge of mechanics and of chemiſtry which is neceſſary for underſtanding this machine; and we have not heard of one in this kingdom who can be put on a par with the preſent patentees in this reſpect. Moſt of the attempts of engineers have been made with the humbler view of availing themſelves of Mr Watt’s discoveries, ſo as to conſtruct a ſteam-engine superior to Newcomen’s, and yet of a form ſufficiently different from Watt’s to keep it without the reach of his patent. This they have in general accompliſhed by performing the condenſation in a place which, with a little ſtretch of fancy, not unfrequent in a court of law, maybe called <hi rend="italic">part of the cylinder.</hi></p><p>The ſucceſs of moſt oſ theſe attempts has interfered ſo little with the intereſt of the patentees, that they have not hindered the erection of many engines which the law would have deemed encroachments. We think it our duty to give our opinion on this ſubject without reserve. Theſe are moſt expensive undertakings, and few employers are able to judge accurately of the merits of a project preſented to them by an ingenious ar- till. They may ſee the practicability of the ſcheme, by having a general notion of the expansion and condenſation of ſteam, and they may be miſled by the ingenuity apparent in the conſtruction. The engineer himſelf is frequently the dupe of his own ingenuity; and it is not always diſhoneſty, but frequently ignorance, which makes him prefer his own invention or (as he thinks it) improvement. It is a moſt delicate engine, and requires much knowledge to ſee what does and what does not improve its performance. We have gone into the preceding minute inveſtigation of Mr Watt’s progreſs with the expreſs purpoſe of making our readers fully maſters<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0776.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0770"/>
of its principles, and have more than once pointed out the real improvements, that they may be firmly fixed and always ready in the mind. By having recourſe to them, the reader may pronounce with confidence on the merits of any new conſtruction, and will not be deceived by the puffs of an ignorant or diſhoneſt engineer.</p><p>We muſt except from this general criticiſm a conſtruction by Mr Jonathan Hornblower near Briſtol, on account of its ſingularity, and the ingenuity and real ſkill which appears in ſome particulars of its conſtruction. The following ſhort deſcription will ſufficiently explain its principle, and enable our readers to appreciate its merit.</p><p>A and B (fig. 15.) repreſent two cylinders, of which A is the largeſt. A piſton moves in each, having their rods C and D moving through collars at E and F. Theſe cylinders may be ſupplied with ſteam from the boiler by means of the ſquare pipe G, which has a flanch to connect it with the rest of the ſteam pipe. This ſquare part is repreſented as branching off to both cylinders. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cl</hi> are two cocks, which have handles and tumblers as uſual, worked by the plug-beam W. On the fore-ſide (that is, the side next the eye) oſ the cylinders is repreſented another communicating pipe, whoſe ſection is alſo ſquare or rectangular, having alſo two cocks <hi rend="italic">a, b.</hi> The pipe Y, immediately under the cock <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> eſtabliſhes a communication between the upper and lower parts of the ſmall cylinder B, by opening the cock <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> There is a ſimilar pipe on the other side of the cylinder A, immediately under the cock <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> When the cocks <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are open, and the cocks <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are ſhut, the ſteam from the boiler has free admiſſion into the upper part of the cylinder B, and the ſteam from the lower part of B has free admiſſion into the upper part of A ; but the upper part of each cylinder has no communication with its lower part.</p><p>From the bottom of the great cylinder proceeds the eduction-pipe K, having a valve at its opening into the cylinder, which bends downwards, and is connected with the conical condenſer L<note anchored="true" n="6" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(c) This, however, was stopped by Watt’s patent; and the condenſation muſt be performed as in Newcomen’s engine, or at leaſt in the cylinder A.</p></note> (c). The condenſer is fixed on a hollow box M, on which ſtand the pumps N and O for extracting the air and water ; which laſt runs along the trough T into a ciſtern U, from which it is raised by the pump V for recruiting the boiler, being already nearly boiling hot. Immediately under the condenſer there is a ſpigot valve at S, over which is a ſmall jet pipe, reaching to the bend of the eductionpipe. The whole of the condenſing apparatus is contained in a ciſtern R of cold water. A ſmall pipe P comes from the side of the condenſer, and terminates on the bottom of the trough T, and is there covered with a valve Q, which is kept tight by the water that is always running over it. Laſtly, the pump-rods X cauſe the outer end of the beam to preponderate, ſo that the quieſcent poſition of the beam is that repreſented in the figure, the piſtons being at the top of the cylinders.</p><p>Suppoſe all the cocks open, and ſteam coming in copiouſly from the boiler, and no condenſation going on in L ; the ſteam muſt drive out all the air, and at laſt follow it through the valve Now ſhut the valves <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and open the valve S of the condenſer. The condemation will immediately commence. There is now no preſſure on the under side of the piſton of A, and it immediately deſcends. The communication between the lower part of B and the upper part of A being open, the ſteam will go from B into the ſpace left by the piſton of A. It muſt therefore expand, and its elaſticity muſt diminiſh, and will no longer balance the preſſure of the ſteam above the piſton of B. This piſton therefore, if not with-held by the beam, would descend till it is in equilibrio, having ſteam of equal denſity above and below it. But it cannot deſcend ſo far ; for the cylinder A is wider than B, and the arm oſ the beam at which its piſton hangs is longer than the arm which supports the piſton of B: therefore when the piſton of B has deſcended as far as the beam will permit it, the ſteam between the two piſtons occupies a larger ſpace than it did when both piſtons were at the tops of their cylinders. Its denſity, therefore, and its elaſticity, diminiſh as its bulk increaſes. It is therefore not a balance ; for the ſteam on the upper fide of B, and the piſton B, <hi rend="italic">pulls</hi> at the beam with all the difference of theſe preſſures. The ſlighteſt view of the ſubject muſt ſhow the reader, that as the piſtons deſcend, the ſteam that is between them will grow continually rarer and leſs elaſtic, and that both piſtons will pull the beam downwards.</p><p>Suppoſe now that each has reached the bottom of its cylinder. Shut the cock a and the eduction cock at the bottom of A, and open the cocks <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The communication being now eſtabliſhed between the upper and lower part of each cylinder, nothing hinders the counter weight from raiſing the piſtons to the top. Let them arrive there. The cylinder B is at this time filled with ſteam of the ordinary denſity, and the cylinder A with an equal abſolute quantity of ſteam, but expanded into a larger ſpace.</p><p>Shut the cocks <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and open the cock <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the eduction cock at the bottom of A ; the condenſation will again operate, and the piſtons deſcend. And thus the operation may be repeated as long as ſteam is ſupplied ; and one full of the cylinder B of ordinary ſteam is expended during each working ſtroke.</p><p>Let us now examine the power of this engine. It is evident, that when both piſtons are at the top of their reſpective cylinders, the active preſſure (that is, the difference of the preſſure on its two ſides) on the piſton of B is nothing, while that on the piſton of A is equal to the full preſſure of the atmoſphere on its area. This, multiplied by the length of the arm by which it is ſupported, gives its mechanical energy. As the piſtons deſcend, the preſſure on the piſton of B increaſes, while that on the piſton of A diminiſhes. When both are at the bottom, the preſſure on the piſton of B is at its maximum, and that on the piſton of A at its minimum.</p><p>Mr Hornblower ſaw that this muſt be a beneficial employment of ſteam, and preferable to the practice of condenſing it while its full elaſticity remained ; but he has not conſidered it with the attention neceſſary for aſcertaining the advantage with preciſion,</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> repreſent the areas of the piſtons of A<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0777.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0771"/>
and B, and let α and ß be the lengths of the arms by which they are ſupported. It is evident, that when both piſtons have arrived at the bottoms of their cylinders, the capacities of the cylinders are as <hi rend="italic">a α</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b β.</hi> Let this be the ratio of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to I. Let <hi rend="italic">g h i k</hi> (fig. 16. ) and <hi rend="italic">l m n o</hi> be two cylinders of equal length, communicating with each other, and fitted with a piſton-rod <hi rend="italic">p q,</hi> on which are fixed two piſtons <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> whoſe areas are as <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and 1. Let the diſtance between the piſtons be preciſely equal to the height of each cylinder, which height we ſhall call h <hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi> Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the ſpace <hi rend="italic">g b</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b a,</hi> through which the piſtons have deſcended. Let the upper cylinder communicate with the boiler, and the lower cylinder with the condenſer or vacuum V.</p><p>Any perſon in the leaſt conversant in mechanics and pneumatics will clearly ſee that the ſtrain or preſſure on the piſton rod pq is preciſely the ſame with the united energies of the two piſton rods of Mr Hornblower’s engine, by which they tend to turn the working beam round its axis.</p><p>The baſe of the upper cylinder being 1, and its height h, its capacity or bulk is 1 <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or <hi rend="italic">h ;</hi> and this expreſſes the natural bulk of the ſteam which formerly filled it, and is now expanded into the ſpace <hi rend="italic">b h l a a m ib.</hi> The part <hi rend="italic">b h i b</hi> is plainly= <hi rend="italic">h — x,</hi> and the part l a a m is = mx <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The whole ſpace therefore is <hi rend="italic">m x</hi> + h <hi rend="italic">— x, = h + m x - x, or h + m - 1x.</hi> Therefore the denſity of the ſteam between the piſtons is h/ (h + m - 1x)</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the downward preſſure of the ſteam from the boiler on the upper piſton <hi rend="italic">b b.</hi> This piſton is alſo preſſed up with a force = p (h/h + m - 1x) by the ſteam between the piſtons. It is therefore, on the whole, preſſed downward with a force = <hi rend="italic">p</hi> [(1- h/(h + m - 1x)]. The lower piſton <hi rend="italic">a a,</hi> having a vacuum below it, is preſsed downwards with a force= p[mh/(h + m - 1x)]. Therefore the whole preſſure on the piſton rod downwards is <hi rend="italic">( mb</hi> h (</p><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> = f</hi> <hi rend="italic">\</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> <hi rend="italic">+</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">in —</hi> I <hi rend="italic">b ∖ pb m —</hi> I <hi rend="italic">pb</hi></p><p>Γf≈ι^J <hi rend="superscript"> , =/ +</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Th≡Γ=T.→</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> Ξ⅛ ■</p><p><hi rend="italic">m —</hi> I " <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ^ ‘</p><p>This then is the momentary preſſure on the piſton rod correſponding to its deſcent <hi rend="italic">x</hi> from its higheſt poſition.

Here therefore is an acceſſion of power. In the beginning the preſſure is greater than on a single piſton in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to 1 ; and at the end of the ſtroke, where the preſſure is weakeſt, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is ſtill much greater than the preſſure on a ſingle piſton. Thus, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be 4, the preſſure at the beginning of the ſtroke is 4p, and at the end it is 7/4, almoſt double, and in all intermediate poſitions it is greater. It is worth while to obtain the ſum total of all the</p><p>accumulated preſſures, that we may compare it with the constant preſſure on a single piſton.</p><p>We may do this by considering the momentary preſſure <hi rend="italic">p</hi> + —-, , as equal to the ordinate GF,</p><p>+ x <hi rend="italic">m—</hi> I</p><p>Hi, or M <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> of a curve F <hi rend="italic">b c</hi> (fig. 10.), which has for its axis the line GM equal to <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the height of our cylinder.

It is evidently <hi rend="italic">— p h</hi> X ( 1 + L AD/AE )∙</p><p>The intelligent reader cannot but obſerve that this is preciſely the ſame with the accumulated preſſure of a quantity of ſteam admitted in the beginning, and ſtopped in Mr Watt’s method, when the piſton has descended through the mth part of the cylinder. In considering Mr Hornblower’s engine, the thing was preſented in ſo different a form that we did not perceive the analogy at firſt, and we were ſurpriſed at the reſult. We could not help even regretting it, becauſe it had the appearance of a new principle and an improvement : and we doubt not but that it appealed ſo to the ingenious author ; for we have had ſuch proofs of his liberality of mind as permit us not to ſuppoſe that he ſaw it from the beginning, and availed himſelf of the difficulty of tracing the analogy. And as the thing may mislead others in the ſame way, we have done a service to the public by ſhowing that this engine, ſo coſtly and ſo difficult in its conſtruction, is no way ſuperior in power to Mr Watt’s simple method of stopping the ſteam. It is even inferior, becauſe there muſt be a condenſation in the communicating paſſages. We may add, that if the condenſation is performed in the cylinder A, which it muſt be unleſs with the permiſſion of Watt and Boulton, the engine cannot be much ſuperior to a common engine ; for much of the ſteam from below B will be condenſed between the piſtons by the coldneſs of the cylinder A; and this diminiſhes the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0778.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0772"/>
downward preſſure on A more than it increases the downward preſſure on B. We learn however that, by confining the condenſation to a ſmall <hi rend="italic">part of the cylinder</hi> A, Mr Hornblower has erected engines clear of Mr Watt’s patent, which are conſiderably ſuperior to Newcomen’s : ſo has Mr Symington.</p><p>We ſaid that there was much ingenuity and real skill obſervable in many particulars of this engine. The diſpoſition and connection of the cylinders, and the whole condenſing apparatus, are contrived with peculiar neatneſs. The cocks are very ingenious they are compoſed of two flat circular plates ground very true to each other, and one of them turns round on a pin through their centres ; each is pierced with three sectoral apertures, exactly correſponding with each other, and occupying a little leſs than one half of their ſurfaces. By turning the moveable plate ſo that the apertures coincide, a large paſſage is opened for the ſteam ; and by turning it ſo that the ſolid of the one covers the aperture of the other, the cock is ſhut. Such regulators are now very common in the cast iron ſtoves for warming rooms.</p><p>Mr Hornblower’s contrivance for making the collars for the piſton rods air-tight is alſo uncommonly ingenious. This collar is in fact two, at a ſmall distance from each other. A ſmall pipe, branching off from the main ſteam pipe, communicates with the space between the collars. This ſteam, being a little ſtronger than the preſſure of the atmoſphere, effectually hinders the air from penetrating by the upper collar; and though a little ſteam ſhould get through the lower collar into the cylinder A, it can do no harm. We ſee many caſes in which this pretty contrivance may be of ſignal ſervice.</p><p>But it is in the framing of the great working beam that Mr Hornblower’s ſcientific knowledge is moſt conſpicuous ; and we have no heſitation in affirming that it is ſtronger than a beam of the common form, and containing twenty times its quantity of timber. There is hardly a part of it expoſed to a tranſverse ſtrain, if we except the ſtrain of the pump V on the ſtrutt by which it is worked. Every piece is either puſhed or pulled in the direction of its length. We only fear that the bolts which connect the upper beam with the two iron bars under its ends will work looſe in their holes, and tear out the wood which lies between them. We would propoſe to ſubſtitute an iron bar for the whole of this upper beam. This working beam highly deserves the attention of all carpenters and engineers. We have that opinion of Mr Hornblower’s knowledge and talents, that we are confident that he will ſee the fairneſs of our examination of his engine, and we truſt to his candour for an excuſe for our criticilm.</p><p>The reciprocating motion of the ſteam-engine has always been conſidered as a great defect ; for though it be now obviated by connecting it with a fly, yet, unleſs it is an engine of double ſtroke, this fly muſt be an enormous maſs of matter moving with great velocity. Any accident happening to it would produce dreadful effects : A part of the rim detaching itſelf would have the force of a bomb, and no building could withſtand it. Many attempts have been made to produce a circular motion at once by the ſteam. It has been made to blow on the vanes of a wheel of various forms. But the rarity of ſteam is ſuch, that even if none is condenſed by the cold of the vanes, the impulſe is exceedingly feeble, and the expence of ſteam, ſo as to produce any ſerviceable impulſe, is enormous. Mr Watt, among his firſt ſpeculations on the ſteam-engine, made ſome attempts of this kind. One in particular was uncommonly ingenious. It conſiſted of a drum turning airtight within another, with cavities ſo diſpoſed that there was a constant and great preſſure urging it in one direction. But no packing of the common kind could preserve: it air-tight with sufficient mobility. He ſucceeded by immersing it in mercury, or in an amalgam which remained fluid in the heat of boiling water ; but the continual trituration ſoon calcined the fluid and rendered it uſeleſs. He then tried Parent’s or Dr Barker’s mill, incloſing the arms in a metal drum, which was immerſed in cold water. The fleam rushed rapidly along the pipe which was the axis, and it was hoped that a great reaction would have been exerted at the ends of the arms ; but it was almoſt nothing. The reaſon ſeems to be, that the greateſt part of the steam was condenſed in the cold arms. It was then tried in a drum kept boiling-hot ; but the impulſe was now very ſmall in companion with the expence of fleam. This muſt be the caſe.</p><p>Mr Watt has described in his specification to the patent office ſome contrivances for producing a circular motion by the immediate action of the fleam. Some of theſe produce alternate motions, and are perfectly analogous to his double stroke engine. Others produce a continued motion. But he has not given ſuch a deſcription of his valves for this purpoſe as can enable an engineer to construct one of them. From any gueſs that we can form, we think the machine very imperfect ; and we do not find that Mr Watt has ever erected a continuous circular engine. He has doubtleſſs found all his attempts inferior to the reciprocating engine with a fly. A very crude ſcheme of this kind may be ſeen in the Tranſactions of the Royal Society of Dublin 1787. But although our attempts have hitherto failed, we hope that the caſe is not yet deſperate : We ſee different principles which have not yet been employed.</p><p>We ſhall conclude our account of this noble engine with obſerving, that Mr Watt’s form ſuggests the construction of an excellent air-pump. A large veſſel may be made to communicate with a boiler at one side, and with the pump-receiver on the other, and alſo with a condenſer. Suppoſe this veſſel of ten times the capacity of the receiver : fill it with fleam from the boiler, and drive out the air from it; then open its communication with the receiver and the condenſer. This will rarefy the air of the receiver 10 times. Repeating the operation will rarefy it 100 times ; the third operation will rarefy it 1000 times; the fourth 10,000 times, &amp;c. All this may be done in half a minute.</p><p><hi rend="italic">STEAM-Kitchen.</hi> Ever ſince Dr Papin contrived his digeſter (about the year 1690), ſchemes have been propoſed for dreſſing victuals by the steam of boiling water. A philoſophical club uſed to dine at Saltero’s coffee-house, Chelſea, about 30 years ago, and had their victuals dreſſed by hanging them in the boiler of the ſteam-engine which raiſes water for the ſupply of Picadilly and its neighbourhood. They were completely dreſſed, and both expeditiouſly and with high flavour.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0779.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0773"/>
A patent was lately obtained for an apparatus for this purpoſe by a tin man in London ; we think of the name of Tate. They are made on a much more effective plan by Gregory, an ingenious tradeſman in Edinburgh, and are coming into very general uſe.</p><p>It is well known to the philoſopher that the ſteam of boiling water contains a prodigious quantity of heat, which it retains in a latent ſtate ready to be faithfully accounted for, and communicated to any colder body. Every cook knows the great ſcalding power of ſteam, and is diſpoſed to think that it is much hotter than boiling water. This, however, is a miſtake ; for it will raiſe the thermometer no higher than the water from which it comes. But we can assure the cook, that if he make the ſteam from the spout of a tea-kettle paſs through a great body of cold water, it will be condenſed or changed into water; and when one pound of water has in this manner been boiled off, it will have heated the maſs of cold water as much as if we had thrown into it ſeven or eight hundred pounds of boiling hot water.</p><p>If, therefore, a boiler be properly fitted up in a furnace, and if the ſteam of the water boiling in it be conveyed by a pipe into a pan containing victuals to be dreffed, every thing can be cooked that requires no higher degree oſ heat than that of boiling water : And this will be done without any riſk of ſcorching, or any kind of overheating, which frequently ſpoils our diſhes, and proceeds from the burning heat of air coming to thoſe parts of the pot or pan which is not filled with liquor, and is covered only with a film, which quickly burns and taints the whole diſh. Nor will the cook be ſcorched by the great heat of the open fire that is necessary for dreſſing at once a number of diſhes, nor have his perſon and clothes ſoiled by the ſmoke and soot unavoidable in the cooking on an open fire. Indeed the whole proceſs is ſo neat, ſo manageable, ſo open to inſpection, and ſo cleanly, that it need neither fatigue nor offend the delicacy of the niceſt lady.</p><p>We had great doubts, when we first heard of this as a general mode of cookery, as to its economy ; we had none as to its efficacy. We thought that the ſteam, and conſequently the fuel expended, muſt be vaſtly greater than by the immediate uſe of an open fire ; but we have ſeen a large tavern dinner expeditiouſly dressed in this manner, ſeemingly with much leſs fuel than in the common method. The following ſimple narration of facts will ſhow the ſuperiority. In a paper manufacture in this neighbourhood, the vats containing the pulp into which the frames are dipped are about six feet diameter, and contain above 200 gallons. This is brought to a proper heat by means of a ſmall cockle or furnace in the middle of the liquor. This is heated by putting in about one hundred-weight of coals about eight o’clock in the evening, and continuing this till four next morning, renewing the fuel as it burns away. This method was lately changed for a ſteam heater. A furnace, having a boiler of five or six feet diameter and three feet deep, is heated about one o’clock in the morning with two hundred weight of coals, and the water kept in briſk ebullition. Pipes go off from this boiler to six vats, ſome of which are at 90 feet distance. It is conveyed into a flat box or vessel in the midſt of the pulp where it condenſes, imparting its heat to the sides of the box, and thus heats the ſurrounding pulp. Theſe six vats are as completely heated in three hours, expending about three hundred weight of coals, as they were formerly in eight hours, expending near 18 hundred weight of coals. Mr Gregory, the inventor of this ſteam-heater, has obtained (in company with Mr Scott plumber, Edinburgh) a patent for the invention ; and we are perſuaded that it will come into very general uſe for many ſimilar purposes. The dyers, hatmakers, and many other manufacturers, have occaſion for large vats kept in a continual heat ; and there ſeems no way ſo effectual.</p><p>Indeed when we reflect ſeriouſly on the ſubject, we ſee that this method has immenſe advantages conſidered merely as a mode of applying heat. The ſteam may be applied to the vessel containing the victuals in every part of its ſurface : it may even be made to enter the vessel, and apply itſelf immediately to the piece of meat that is to be dressed, and this without any riſk of ſcorching or overdoing.—And it will give out about 799/800 of the heat which it contains, and will do this only if it be wanted ; ſo that no heat whatever is waited except what is required for heating the apparatus. Experience ſhows that this is a mere trifle in companion of what was ſuppoſed necessary. But with an open fire we only apply the flame and hot air to the bottom and part of the sides of our boiling vessels : and this application is hurried in the extreme ; for to make a great heat, we muſt have a great fire, which requires a prodigious and moſt rapid current of air. This air touches our pans but for a moment, imparts to them but a ſmall portion of its heat ; and, we are perſuaded that three-fourths oſ the heat is carried up the chimney, and eſcapes in pure waſte, while another great portion beams out into the kitchen, to the great annoyance of the ſcorched cook. We think, therefore, that a page or two of this work will not be thrown away in the deſcription of a contrivance by which a ſaving may be made to the entertainer, and the providing the pleaſures of his table prove a leſs fatiguing talk to this valuable corps of practical chemiſts.</p><p>Let A repreſent a kitchen-boiler<note anchored="false" n="7" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Plate CCCCLXXII. fig. 5.</p></note>, either properly fitted up in a furnace, with its proper fire place, aſh-pit, and flue, or ſet on a tripod on the open fire, or built up in the general fire place.

The piece of meat M is laid on a tin plate grate KL, pierced with holes like a cullender, and standing on three ſhort feet <hi rend="italic">nnn.</hi></p><p>The ſteam from the boiler comes in by the pipe I, and is condenſed by the meat and by the sides of the vessel, communicating to them all its heat. What is not ſo condenſed eſcapes between the vessel and its cover. The condenſed water lies on the bottom of the vessel, mixed with a very ſmall quantity of gravy and fatty matter from the victuals. Frequently, inſtead of a cover, another ſtew-vessel with a cullender bottom is ſet on this one, the bottom of the one fitting the mouth<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0780.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0774"/>
of the other : and <hi rend="italic">it is obſerved,</hi> that when this is done, the diſh in the under veſſel is more expeditiouſly and better dreſſed, and the upper diſh is more ſlowly, but as completely ſtewed.</p><p>This deſcription of one ſtewing veſſel may ſerve to give a notion oſ the whole ; only we muſt obſerve, that when broths, ſoups, and diſhes with made ſauces or containing liquids, are to be dreſſed, they muſt be put into a ſmaller veſſel, which is ſet into the veſſel PQRS, and is ſupported on three ſhort feet, ſo that there may be a ſpace all round it of about an inch or three quarters of an inch. It is obſerved, that diſhes of this kind are not ſo expeditiouſly cooked as on an open fire, but as completely in the end, only requiring to be turned up now and then to mix the ingredients; becauſe as the liquids in the inner veſſel can never come into ebullition, unleſs the ſteam from the boiler be made of a dangerous heat, and every thing be cloſe confined, there cannot be any of that tumbling motion that we obſerve in a boiling pot.</p><p>The performance oſ this apparatus is far beyond any expectation we had formed of it. In one which we examined, six pans were ſtewing together by means of a boiler 10 1/2 inches in diameter, ſtanding on a bridle open fire. It boiled very briſkly, and the ſteam puffed frequently through the chinks between the ſtew-pans and their covers. In one of them was a piece of meat conſiderably above 30 pounds weight. This required above four hours ſtewing, and was then very thoroughly and equally cooked ; the outside being no more done than the heart, and it was near two pounds heavier than when put in, and greatly ſwelled. In the mean time, several diſhes had been dreſſed in the other pans. As far as we could judge, this cooking did not conſume one-third part of the fuel which an open fire would have required for the ſame effect.</p><p>When we conſider this apparatus with a little more knowledge of the mode of operation of fire than falls to the ſhare of the cooks (we ſpeak with deference), and conſider the very injudicious manner in which the steam is applied, we think that it may be improved ſo as to ſurpaſs any thing that the cook can have a notion of.</p><p>When the ſteam enters the ſtew-pan, it is condenſed on the meat and on the vessel ; but we do not want it to be condenſed on the vessel. And the ſurface of the veſſel is much greater than that of the meat, and continues much colder ; for the meat grows hot, and continues ſo, while the veſſel, made of metal which is a very perfect conductor of heat, is continually robbed of its heat by the air of the kitchen, and carried off by it. If the meat touch the side of the pan in any part, no ſteam can be applied to that part of the meat, while it is continually imparting heat to the air by the intermedium of the veſſel. Nay, the meat can hardly be dreſſed unleſs there be a current of ſteam through it; and we think this confirmed by what is obſerved above, that when another ſtew-pan is ſet over the firſt, and thus gives occasion to a current of ſteam through its cullender bottom to be condenſed by its ſides and contents, the lower diſh is more expeditiouſly dreſſed. We imagine, therefore, that not leſs than half of the ſteam is wasted on the sides of the different stew-pans. Our firſt attention is therefore called to this circumſtance, and we wiſh to apply the ſteam more economically and effectually.</p><p>We would therefore construct the ſteam-kitchen in the following manner :</p><p>We would make a wooden cheſt (which we ſhall call the <hi rend="smallcaps">Stew-chest)</hi> ABCD. This ſhould be made of deal, in very narrow slips, not exceeding an inch, that it may not ſhrink. This ſhould be lined with very thin copper, lead, or even ſtrong tinfoil. This will prevent it from becoming a conductor of heat by ſoaking with ſteam. For further ſecurity it might be ſet in another cheſt, with a ſpace of an inch or two all round, and this ſpace filled with a compoſition of powdered charcoal and clay. This ſhould be made by firſt making a mixture of fine potter’s clay and water about as thick as poor cream : then as much powdered charcoal muſt be beat up with this as can be made to ſtick together. When this is rammed in and dry, it may be hot enough on one side to melt glaſs, and will not discolour white paper on the other.</p><p>This cheſt muſt have a cover L M N O, alſo of wood, having holes in it io receive the ſtew-pans P, R. Between each pan is a wooden partition, covered on both ſides with milled lead or tinfoil. The whole top muſt be covered with very ſpungy leather or felt, and made very flat. Each ſtew-pan muſt have a bearing or ſhoulder all round it, by which it is ſupported, resting on the felt, and lying ſo true and cloſe that no ſteam can eſcape. Some of the pans ſhould be simple, like the pan F, for dreſſing broths and other liquid diſhes. Others ſhould be like E and G, having in the bottom a pretty wide hole H, K, which has a pipe in its upper ſide, riſing about an inch or an inch and half into the ſtew-pan. The meat is laid on a cullender plate as in the common way ; only there muſt be no holes in the cullender immediately above the pipe.— Theſe ſtew-pans muſt be fitted with covers, or they may have others fitted to their mouths, for warming fauces or other diſhes, or ſtewing greens, and many other ſubordinate purpoſes for which they may be fitted.</p><p>The main-pipe from the boiler muſt have branches, (each furniſhed with a cock), which admit the ſteam into theſe diviſions. At its firſt entry ſome will be condenſed on the bottom and ſides ; but we imagine that theſe will in two minutes be heated ſo as to condenſe no more, or almoſt nothing. The ſteam will alſo quickly condenſe on the ſtew-pan, and in half a minute make it boiling hot, ſo that it will condenſe no more ; all the reſt will now apply itſelf to the meat and to the cover. It may perhaps be adviſable to allow the cover to condenſe ſteam, and even to waſte it. This may be promoted by laying on it flannel ſoaked in water. Our view in this is to create a demand for ſteam, and thus produce a current through the ſtew-pan, which will be applied in its paſſage to the victuals. But we are not certain of the neceſſity of this. Steam is not like common air of the ſame temperature, which would glide along the ſurfaces of bodies, and impart to them a ſmall portion of its heat, and eſcape with the reſt. To produce this effect there <hi rend="italic">muſt</hi> be a current ; for air hot enough to melt lead, will not boil water, if it be kept ſtagnant round the veſſel. But ſteam imparts the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of its latent heat to any body colder than boiling water, and goes no farther till this body be made boiling hot.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0781.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0775"/>
It is a moſt faithſul carrier oſ heat, and will deliver its whole charge to anybody that can take it. Therefore, although there were no partitions in the stew-chest, and the ſteam were admitted at the end next the boiler, if the pan at the farther end be colder than the rest, it will all go thither ; and will, in ſhort, communicate to every thing impartially according to the demand. If any perſon has not the confidence in the ſteam which we expreſs, he may ſtill be certain that there muſt be a prodigious ſaving of heat by confining the whole in the stew-cheſt ; and he may make the pans with entire bottoms, and admit the ſteam into them in the common way, by pipes which come through the ſides of the cheſt and then go into the pan. There will be none loſt by condenſation on the ſides of the cheſt; and the pans will ſoon be heated up to the boiling temperature; and hardly any of their heat will be waſted, becauſe the air in the cheſt will be ſtagnant. The chief reaſon for recommending our method is the much greater eaſe with which the ſtew pans can be ſhifted and cleaned. There will be little difference in the performance.</p><p>Nay, even the common ſteamſkſtchen may be prodigiouſly improved by merely wrapping each pan in three or four folds of coarſe dry flannel, or making flannel bags of three or four folds fitted to their shape, which can be put on or removed in a minute. It will alſo greatly conduce to the good performance to wrap the main ſteam pipe in the same manner in flannel.</p><p>We ſaid that this main-pipe is conducted from the boiler with a gentle aſcent. The intention of this is, that the water produced by the unavoidable condenſation of the ſteam may run back into the boiler. But the rapid motion of the ſteam generally sweeps it up hill, and it runs into the branch-pipes and deſcends into the ſtew-pans. Perhaps it would be as well to give the main-pipe a declivity the other way, and allow all the water to collect in a hot well at the farther end, by means of a deſcending pipe, having a loaded valve at the end. This may be ſo contrived as to be cloſe by the fire, where it would be ſo warm that it would not check the boiling if again poured into the boiler. But the utmoſt attention muſt be paid to cleanlineſs in the whole of this paſſage, becauſe this water is boiled again, and its ſteam passes through the heart oſ every diſh. This circumſtance forbids us to return into the boiler what is condenſed in the ſtew-pans. This would mix the taſtes and flavours of every diſh, and be very diſagreeable. All this muſt remain in the bottom of each ſtew-pan ; for which reaſon we put in the pipe riſing up in the middle of the bottom. It might indeed be allowed to fall down into the ſtew-cheſt, and to be collected in a common receptacle, while the fat would float at top, and the clear gravy be obtained below, perhaps fit for many ſauces.</p><p>The completeſt method for getting rid of this condenſed ſteam would be to have a ſmall pipe running along the under side of the main conductor, and communicating with it at different places, in a manner ſimilar to the air diſcharger on the mains of water-pipes. In the paper manufacture mentioned above, each ſteam- box has a pipe in its bottom, with a float-cock, by which the water is diſcharged ; and the main pipe being of great diameter, and laid with a proper acclivity, the water runs back into the boiler.</p><p>But theſe precautions are of little moment in a ſteam-kitchen even for a great table ; and for the general uſe of private families, would hurt the apparatus, by making it complex and of nice management. For a ſmall family, the whole apparatus may be ſet on a table four feet long and two broad, which may be placed on callers, ſo as to be wheeled out of the way when not in uſe. If the main conductor be made of wood, or properly caſed in flannel, it will condenſe ſo little ſteam that the cooking table may ſtand in the remoteſt corner of the kitchen without ſenſibly impairing its performance ; and if the boiler be properly ſet up in a ſmall furnace, and the flue made ſo that the flame may be applied to a great part of its ſurface, we are perſuaded, that three-fourths of the fuel uſed in common cookerywill be ſaved. Its only inconvenience ſeems to be the indispensable neceſſity of the moſt anxious cleanlineſs in the whole apparatus. The moſt trifling neglect in this will deſtroy a whole dinner.</p><p>We had almoſt forgotten to obſerve, that the boiler muſt be furniſhed with a funnel for ſupplying it with water. This ſhould paſs through the top, and its pipe reach near to the bottom. It will be proper to have a cock on this funnel. There ſhould alſo be another pipe in the top of the boiler, having a valve on the top. If this be loaded with a pound on every ſquare inch, and the fire ſo regulated that ſteam may be obſerved to puff ſometimes from this valve, we may be certain that it is paſſing through our diſhes with ſufficient rapidity ; and if we ſhut the cock on the funnel, and load the valve a little more, we ſhall cauſe the ſteam to blow at the covers oſ the ſtew-pans. If one of theſe be made very tight, and have a hole alſo furniſhed with a loaded valve, this pan becomes a digeſter, and will diſſolve bones, and do many things which are impracticable in the ordinary cookery.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Si quid novisti rectius istis,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Candidus imperti ;— si nοn, hiis utere nostris.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
