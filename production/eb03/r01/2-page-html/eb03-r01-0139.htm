<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fèrtation (in the </span><span class="font2">8th volume of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Com. Petropol.} </span><span class="font2">on the action and reſiftance of fluids, limited to a very&nbsp;particular caſe ; namely, to the impulfe of a vein of&nbsp;fluid falling perpendicularly on an infinitely extended&nbsp;plane ſurface. This he demonſirates to be equal to the&nbsp;weight of a column ot the fluid whoſe baſe is the area&nbsp;oſ the vein, and whoſe height is twice the fall producing the velocity. Tins demonftration is drawn front&nbsp;the true principles of mechanics and the acknowledged&nbsp;laws of hydraulics, and may be received as a ſtrict phy-flcal demonftration. As it is the only propofition in the&nbsp;whole theory that has as yet received a demonftration&nbsp;acceſſible to readers not verfant in all the refinement of&nbsp;modern analyfis·; and as the principles on which it pro-ceeds will undoubtedly lead to a folution of every pro-blem which can be propoled, once that our mathemati-cal knowledge ſſiall enable us to apply them—we think&nbsp;it our duty to give it in this place, although we muſt&nbsp;acknowledge, that this problem is ſo very limited, that,&nbsp;it will hardly bear an applicatiαn to any caſe that dif</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fers but a little from the expreſs conditions of the pro-blem. 1 here do occur caſes however in practice, where it may be applied to very great advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daniel Bernoulli gives two demonſtrations ; one of which may be called a popular one, and the other is&nbsp;more fcientil∣c and introductory to further inveft⅛ιtion.&nbsp;we ſſiall give both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bernoulli firſt determines the whole action exerted m the efflux of the vein of fluid. Suppofe the velocity&nbsp;of efflux </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font2"> is that which would be acquired by falling&nbsp;through the height </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font2"> It is well known that a body&nbsp;moving during the time of this fall with the velocity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">would deſcribe a ſpace 2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font2"> The effect, therefore, of&nbsp;the hydraulic action is, that in the time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2"> of the fall </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">there iffues a cylinder or prifrn of water whoſe baſe is&nbsp;the croſs lection </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font2"> or area of the vein, and whofe length&nbsp;is 2∕&gt;. And this quantity of matter is now moving&nbsp;with the velocity τ&gt;. The quantity of motion, therefore,&nbsp;which is thus produced is 2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s hν ;</span><span class="font2"> and this quantity of&nbsp;motion is produced in the time Λ And this is the ac-cumulated effect of all the expelling forces, eſtimated&nbsp;in. the direction of the efflux. Now, to compare this&nbsp;with trie exertion oi ſome preſſing power with which&nbsp;we. are familiarly acquainted, let us fuppoſe this pillar&nbsp;2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s h</span><span class="font2"> to be frozen, and, being held in the hand, to be&nbsp;dropped. It is well known, that in the time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2"> it will&nbsp;fall through the height Z&gt;, and will acquire the velocity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v,</span><span class="font2"> and now poffeſſes the quantity of motion 2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s h ∙υ_</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and all this is the effect of its weight. The weight, theιefore, of the pillar 2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s h</span><span class="font2"> produces the ſame effect,&nbsp;and in the ſame time, and (as may eahly be ſeen j in the&nbsp;fame .gιadual manner, with the expelling forces of the&nbsp;fluid in the veffel, which expelling forces ariſe from the&nbsp;preffure of all the fluid in the veffel. Therefore the&nbsp;accumulated hydraulic preffure, by which a vein of a heavy fluid is forced out through an orifice in the bottom&nbsp;or fide oi a veffel, is equal (when eſtimated in thedirec-ι∙ion of the efflux) to the weight of a column of the&nbsp;fluid, having for its baſe the lection of the vein, and&nbsp;twice the fall productive of the velocity of efflux for&nbsp;its height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now let ABDC (fig. 11.) be a quadrangular veffel v. ιth upιight plane fides, in one of which is an orifice&nbsp;EF. From every point of the circumference of this</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">orifice, ſuppoſe horizontal lines Ef, F∕, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;c. which will </span><span class="font2">mark a fimilar ſurface on the oppofite fide of the veffel.&nbsp;Suppoſe the orifice EF to be ſſiut. There can be no&nbsp;doubt but that the ſurfaces EF and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ef</span><span class="font2"> will be equally&nbsp;preffed in oppofite directions. Now open the orifice&nbsp;EF ; the water will ruſh out, and the preffure on EF&nbsp;is now removed. There will therefore be a tendency&nbsp;in the veffel to move back in the direction E </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font2"> And&nbsp;this tendency mnſt be preciſely equal and oppofite to the&nbsp;whole effort of the expelling forces. This is a conclu-lion as evident as any propofition in mechanics. It is&nbsp;thus that a gun recoils and a rocket riſes in the air; and&nbsp;on this is founded the operation of Mr Parents or Dr&nbsp;Barker’s mill, defcribed in all treatiſes of mechanics,&nbsp;and moſt learnedly treated by Euler in the Berlin Memoirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now, let this ſtream of water be received on a circular plane MN, perpendicular to its axis, and let this circular plane be of ſuch extent, that the vein eſcapes&nbsp;from its fides in an infinitely thin ſſieet, the water flowing off in a direction parallel to the plane. The vein&nbsp;by this means will expand into a trumpet-like ſſiape, having curved fides, EKG,FLH. w<sub>e</sub> abftract at pre-ſent the action of gravity which would cauſe the vein&nbsp;to bend downwards, and occafion a greater velocity at&nbsp;II than at G ; and we fuppoſe the velocity equal in&nbsp;every point of the circumference. It is plain, that if&nbsp;the action of gravity be neglected after the water has&nbsp;iffued through the orifice EF, the velocity in every&nbsp;point of the circumference of the plane MN will be&nbsp;that of the efflux through EF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now, becauſe EKG is the natural ſſiape affirmed by the vein, it is plain, that if the whole vein were covered by a tube or mouth-piece, fitted to its ihape, and&nbsp;perfectly poliſhed, ſo that the water ſſiall glide along&nbsp;it, without any friction (a thing which we may always&nbsp;iuppoie), the water will exert no preffure whatever on&nbsp;this trumpet mouth-piece. Laftly, let us ſuppoſe that&nbsp;the plane MN is attached to the mouth-piece by ſome&nbsp;bits of wire, lo as to allow the water to eſcape all round ∙&nbsp;by the narrow chink between the mouth-piece and the&nbsp;plane : We have now a veffel confiſting of the upright</span></p>
    <p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">K<sup>ab</sup>,<sup>dc,</sup></span><span class="font2"> the tr.<sup>um</sup>P<sup>et</sup> GKEFLH, and the plane MN ; and the water is eſcaping from every point oſ the&nbsp;circumference of the chink GHNM with the velocity&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ν.</span><span class="font2"> If any part of this chink were ſſiut up, there would&nbsp;be a preffure on that part equivalent to the force of efflux from the oppofite parr. Therefore, when all is&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>pe∏, thete efforts oi efflux balance each other all round.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here is not therefore any tendency in this compound&nbsp;veffel to move to any fide. . But take away the plane&nbsp;MN, and there would immediately ariſe a preffure&nbsp;in the direction E </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"> equal to the weight of the column</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j /?. This is therefore balanced by the preffure on&nbsp;the circular plane MN, which is therefore equal to this&nbsp;weight, and the propofition is demonſtrated. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A number of experiments were made by Profeffor Kraft at St Peterſhurg, by receiving the vein on a plane&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MN (hg. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii.)</span><span class="font2"> which was faſtened to the arm of a balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having a ſcale R hanging on the oppofite</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">arm. I he refiſtance or preffure on the plane was mea-iùred by weights put into the ſcale R; and the velocity of the jet was meaſured by means of the diſtance KR,&nbsp;to which it· fpouted on a horizontal' plane.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
