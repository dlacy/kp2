<p><span class="font1">made that branch of knowledge through life his chief study and delight. He is said, with the assistance of friends touched&nbsp;by the same flame, to have opened a school for geography&nbsp;in his house at Venice. And it appears from a letter addressed&nbsp;to him by his friend Andrea Navagero, that as early as 1523&nbsp;the preparation of material for his great work had already&nbsp;begun. The task had been suggested and encouraged, as&nbsp;Ramusio himself states in a dedicatory epistle to the famous&nbsp;Girolamo Fracastoro, by that scholar, his lifelong friend;&nbsp;an address to the same personage indeed introduced each of&nbsp;the three volumes, and in the first the writer speaks of his&nbsp;desire to bequeath to posterity, along with his labours, “ a&nbsp;testimony to the long and holy friendship that had existed&nbsp;between the two.” They were contemporaries in the strictest&nbsp;sense (Ramusio 1485-1557, Fracastorius 1483-1553). His&nbsp;correspondence, which was often devoted to the collection&nbsp;of new material for his work, was immense, and embraced&nbsp;many distinguished men. Among those whose names have&nbsp;still an odour of celebrity were Fracastoro, just mentioned,&nbsp;Cardinal Pietro Bembo, Damiano de Goez, and Sebastian Cabot;&nbsp;among lesser lights, Vettor Fausto, Daniel Barbara, Paolo&nbsp;Manuzio, Andrea Navagero, the cardinals Gasparo Contarini&nbsp;and Gregorio Cortese, and the printer Tommaso Giunti, editor&nbsp;after Ramusio’s death of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two volumes only of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi e Viaggi</span><span class="font1"> were published during the life of Gian Battista, vol. i. in 1550, vol. iii. in 1556;&nbsp;vol. ii. did not appear till 1559, two years after his death,&nbsp;delayed, as his friend and printer T. Giunti explains, not only&nbsp;by that event but by a fire in the printing-office (November&nbsp;1557), which destroyed a part of the material which had been&nbsp;prepared. It had been Ramusio’s intention to publish a fourth&nbsp;volume, containing, as be mentions himself, documents relating&nbsp;to the Andes, and, as appears from one of the prefaces of&nbsp;Giunti, others relating to explorations towards the Antarctic.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Ramusio’s collection was by no means the first of the kind,&nbsp;though it was, and we may say on the whole continues to be,&nbsp;the best. Even before the invention of the press such collections were known, of which that made by a certain Long&nbsp;John of Yprès, abbot of St Bertin, in the latter half of the&nbsp;14th century was most meritorious, and afforded in its transcription a splendid field for embellishment by the miniaturists,&nbsp;which was not disregarded. The best of the printed collections&nbsp;before Ramusio’s was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novus Orbis,</span><span class="font1"> edited at Basel by&nbsp;Simon Grynaeus in 1532, and reissued in 1537 and 1555. This,&nbsp;however, can boast of no disquisitions nor of much editorial&nbsp;judgment. Ramusio’s collection is in these respects far&nbsp;superior, as well as in the variety and fulness of its matter.&nbsp;He spared no pains in ransacking Italy and the Spanish&nbsp;peninsula for contributions, and in translating them when&nbsp;needful into the racy Italian of his day. Several of the pieces&nbsp;are very rare in any other shape than that exhibited in&nbsp;Ramusio’s collection; several besides of importance—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the invaluable travels of Barbosa and Pigafetta’s account of&nbsp;Magellan’s voyage—were not publicly known in any complete&nbsp;form till the present century. Of two important articles&nbsp;at least the originals have never been otherwise printed or&nbsp;discovered; one of these is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Summary of all the Kingdoms,&nbsp;Cities, and Nations from the Red Sea to China,</span><span class="font1"> a work translated&nbsp;from the Portuguese, and dating apparently from about 1535;&nbsp;the other, the remarkable Ramusian redaction of Marco Polo&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prefatione, Espositione</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dickiarazione,</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;precede this version of Marco Polo’s book, are the best and&nbsp;amplest examples of Ramusio’s own style as an editor. They&nbsp;are full of good sense and of interesting remarks derived from&nbsp;his large reading and experience, and few pictures in words&nbsp;were ever touched more delightfully than that in which he&nbsp;sketches the return of the Polo family to their native city, as&nbsp;he had received it in the tradition of the Venetian elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were several editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi e Viaggi,</span><span class="font1"> and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">as additions continued to be made to the several volumes a good deal of bibliographical interest attaches to these various&nbsp;modifications.@@<sup>2</sup> The two volumes (i. and iii.) published in&nbsp;Ramusio’s lifetime do not bear his name on the title-page,&nbsp;nor does it appear in the addresses to his friend Fracastoríus&nbsp;with which these volumes begin (as does also the second and&nbsp;posthumous volume). The editions of vol. i. are as follows:&nbsp;1550, 1554, 1563, 1588, 1606, 1613.@@<sup>3</sup> The edition of 1554&nbsp;contains the following articles which are not in that of 1550:&nbsp;(1) copious index; (2) “Narr. di un Compagno di Barbosa”;&nbsp;(3) “ Informationi del Giapan&quot;; (4) “ Alli Lettori di Giov. de&nbsp;Barros ”; (5) “ Capitoli estratti da di Barros.” The edition&nbsp;of 1563 adds to these a preliminary leaf concerning Ramusio,&nbsp;“ Tommaso Giunti alli Lettori.” After 1563 there is no change&nbsp;in the contents of this volume, only in the title-page. It&nbsp;should be added that in the edition of 1554 there are three&nbsp;double-page woodcut maps (Africa, India and India extra&nbsp;Gangem), which do not exist in the edition of 1550, and which&nbsp;are replaced by copperplate maps in subsequent editions.&nbsp;These maps are often missing. The editions of vol. ii. are&nbsp;as follows: 1559, 1574, 1583, 1606. There are important&nbsp;additions in the 1574 copy, and still further additions in that&nbsp;of 1583. The additions made in 1574 were: (1) “ Herberstein,&nbsp;Della Moscovia e della Russia ’’; (2) “ Viaggio in Persia di&nbsp;Caterino Zeno ’’;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) “ Scoprimento dell' Isola Frislanda,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&amp;c., per due fratelli Zeni ’’; (4) “ Viaggi in Tartaria per alcuni frati Minori (5) “ Viaggio del Beato Odorico ” (two versions).&nbsp;Further additions made in 1583 were: (1) “Navigatîone di&nbsp;Seb. Cabota (2) at the end 90 ff. with fresh pagination,&nbsp;containing ten articles on “ Sarmatia, Polonia, Lithuania,&nbsp;Prussia, Livonia, Moscovia, and the Tartars by Aless. Guagnino&nbsp;and Matteo di Micheovo.” The two latest “ editions ” of&nbsp;vol. ii. are identical, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> from the same type, with a change of&nbsp;title-page only, and a reprint of the last leaf of the preface&nbsp;and of the last leaf of the book. But the last circumstance&nbsp;does not apply to all copies. In one, whilst the title bears&nbsp;1606, the colophon bears “ Appresso i Giunti, 1583.’’ Vol. iii.&nbsp;editions are of 1556, 1565 and 1606.@@<sup>4</sup> There is no practical&nbsp;difference between the first two, but that of 1606 has forty-five&nbsp;pages of important new matter, which embraces the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traυels&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Cesare Fedrici or Federici in India, one of the most valuable&nbsp;narratives of the 16th century, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Three Voyages of the&nbsp;Hollanders and Zealanders to Nova Zembla and Groenland.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Vol. iii. also contains (omitting maps and figures inserted in&nbsp;the text, or with type on the reverse) a two-page topographical&nbsp;view of Cuzco, a folding map of Terra Nova and Labrador, a&nbsp;two-page map of Brazil, a two-page map of Guinea, &amp;c., a&nbsp;two-page map of Sumatra, a two-page pictorial plan of the&nbsp;town of Hochelaga in New France, and a general map of the&nbsp;New World in a hemisphere. Brunet’s statement mentions&nbsp;issues of vol. ii. in 1564, and of vol. iii. in 1613; but these seem&nbsp;to have no existence. It would thus appear that a set of&nbsp;Ramusio, to be as complete as possible, should embrace—&nbsp;for vol. i., 1563 or any subsequent edition; for vol. ii., 1583&nbsp;or 1606; for vol. iii., 1606.</span></p>
