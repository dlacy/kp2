        <p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Period II.: The Dominate, a.d.
                284-476.—(a) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">From the
                Accession of Diocletian to the Death of Theodosius </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d. 284-395).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The work of fortifying the empire alike against internal sedition and
                foreign invasion, begun by Aurelian and&nbsp;Probus, was completed by Diocletian and
                Constantine&nbsp;the Great, whose system of government, novel as it&nbsp;appears at
                first sight, was in reality the natural and&nbsp;inevitable outcome of the history
                of the previous century.@@<sup>1</sup> Its&nbsp;object was twofold, to give
                increased stability to the imperial&nbsp;authority itself, and to organize an
                efficient administrative&nbsp;machinery throughout the empire. In the second
                year&nbsp;of his reign Diocletian associated Maximian with himself as colleague, and
                six years later (293) the hands of&nbsp;the two <sup>u</sup> Augusti ” were further
                strengthened by the proclamation of Constantins and Galerius as “Caesares.”
                Precedents for such an arrangement were to be found in the earlier&nbsp;history of
                the Principate@@<sup>2</sup>; and it divided the burdens and&nbsp;responsibilities
                of government, without sacrificing the unity of&nbsp;the empire; for, although to
                each of the Augusti and Caesars a&nbsp;separate sphere was assigned, the Caesars
                were subordinate to&nbsp;the higher authority of the Augusti, and over all his
                three&nbsp;colleagues Diocletian claimed to exercise a paramount control.&nbsp;It
                also reduced the risk of a disputed succession by establishing&nbsp;in the two
                Caesars the natural successors to the Augusti,&nbsp;and it satisfied the jealous
                pride of the rival armies by&nbsp;giving them </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">imperatives</span><span class="font0"> of their own. The
                distribution of&nbsp;power between Diocletian and his colleagues followed
                those&nbsp;lines of division which the feuds of the previous century&nbsp;had marked
                out. The armies of the Rhine, the Danube and&nbsp;of Syria fell to the lot
                respectively of Constantius, Galerius&nbsp;and Diocletian, the central districts of
                Italy and Africa to</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Maximian.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the new system the imperial authority was finally emancipated from
                all constitutional limitation and control and&nbsp;the last traces of it's
                republican origin disappeared.&nbsp;The emperors from Diocletian onwards were
                autocrats&nbsp;in theory as well as in practice. This avowed&nbsp;despotism
                Diocletian, following in the steps of Aurelian,&nbsp;hedged round with all the pomp
                and majesty of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Oriental monarchy. The final adoption of the title </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dominus, </span><span class="font0">the
                diadem on the head, the robes of silk and gold, the replacement of the republican
                salutation of a fellow-citizen by the&nbsp;adoring prostration even of the highest
                in rank before their lord&nbsp;and master, were all significant marks of the new
                    regime.@@<sup>4</sup> In&nbsp;the hands of this absolute ruler was placed the
                entire&nbsp;control of an elaborate administrative machinery.&nbsp;Most of the old
                local and national distinctions, privileges and liberties which had once flourished
                within&nbsp;the empire had already disappeared under the levelling&nbsp;influence of
                imperial rule, and the process was now completed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Roman citizenship had, since the edict of Caracalla, ceased to be the
                privilege of a minority. Diocletian&nbsp;finally reduced Italy and Rome to the level
                of the&nbsp;provinces: the provincial land-tax and provincial&nbsp;government were
                introduced into Italy@@<sup>5</sup> while Rome ceased to&nbsp;be even in name the
                seat of imperial authority@@<sup>6</sup> Throughout&nbsp;the whole area of the
                empire a uniform system of&nbsp;administration was established, the control of
                which&nbsp;was centred in the imperial palace.@@<sup>7</sup> Between the
                civil&nbsp;and military departments the separation was complete. At the head of the
                former were the praetorian prefects@@<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;next below them the
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vicarii,</span><span
                class="font0"> who had charge of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"

                host of minor officials. Parallel with this civil&nbsp;hierarchy was the scries of

                    downwards.@@<sup>10</sup> In both there is&nbsp;the utmost possible
                subordination and division of authority.&nbsp;The subdivision of provinces, begun by
                the emperors of the 2nd&nbsp;century, was systematically carried out by Diocletian,
                and&nbsp;each official, civil or military, was placed directly under the&nbsp;orders
                of a superior; thus a continuous chain of authority connected the emperor with the
                meanest official in his service.&nbsp;Finally, the various grades in these two
                imperial services were&nbsp;carefully marked by the appropriation to each of
                distinctive&nbsp;titles, the highest being that of </span><span class="font0"

                    Italy, together with Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, was divided into 17
                    provinciae. Each had its&nbsp;own governor; the governors were subject to the
                    two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vicarii
                    (vie.&nbsp;urbis, vie. Italiae),</span><span class="font0"> and they in turn to

                    and Western Illyricum.</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font0">There can be little doubt that on the whole these reforms prolonged
                the existence of the empire, by creating a machinery&nbsp;which enabled the stronger
                emperors to utilize effectively all its available resources, and which even to
                some&nbsp;extent made good the deficiencies of weaker rulers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But in many points they failed to attain their object. Diocletian’s
                division of the imperial authority among colleagues,&nbsp;subject to the general
                control of the senior Augustus, was effectually discredited by the twenty years of
                almost constant conflict&nbsp;which followed his own abdication (305-23).
                Constantine’s&nbsp;partition of the empire among his three sons was not
                more&nbsp;successful in ensuring tranquillity, and in the final division of
                the&nbsp;East and West between Valens and Valentinian (364) the&nbsp;essential
                principle of Diocletian’s scheme, the maintenance of&nbsp;a single central
                authority, was abandoned. The “ tyrants,”&nbsp;the curse of the 3rd century, were
                far from unknown in the 4th.&nbsp;The system, moreover, while it failed altogether
                to remove some&nbsp;of the existing evils, aggravated others. The already
                overburdened financial resources of the empire were strained still&nbsp;further by
                the increased expenditure necessitated by the substitution of four imperial courts
                for one, and by the multiplication&nbsp;in every direction of paid officials. The
                gigantic bureaucracy&nbsp;of the 4th century proved, in spite of its undoubted
                services,&nbsp;an intolerable weight upon the energies of the empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Diocletian and Maximian formally abdicated their high office in 305.
                Nineteen years later Constantine I., the Great, the&nbsp;sole survivor of six rival
                emperors, united the whole&nbsp;empire under his own rule. His reign of
                fourteen&nbsp;years was marked by two events of first-rate importance,—the
