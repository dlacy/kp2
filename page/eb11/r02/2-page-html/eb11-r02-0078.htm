<p><span class="font2">are seats. In principle the second ballot has much in its favour, though it does not necessarily reflect the real opinion of the&nbsp;electorate, but only what is practicable; and while leading to&nbsp;political bargaining it does nothing for minority representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In England the importance of the whole subject of the method of elections was recognized at the end of 1908 by the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire and report. Its conclusions were published in 1910, after much interesting evidence&nbsp;had been taken, but they attracted little attention, being in the&nbsp;main adverse to innovation. The one positive recommendation was for thc adoption of the “ alternative vote ” (already&nbsp;in use in Queensland and Western Australia) by which the&nbsp;electors might mark their choices 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.; this would not be&nbsp;for the purpose already discussed as part of the method of the&nbsp;“ transferable vote,” but the indications of preference would only&nbsp;be used for the same purpose as the “ second ballot,” while&nbsp;saving the voters the trouble of further elections. One objection&nbsp;to this “ alternative vote,” however, as compared with the&nbsp;“ second ballot,” is that it does not allow the voter to change&nbsp;his mind as to his preference, as he well might do after he knew&nbsp;the result of the original voting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be said broadly that all the devices which have been proposed for mitigating or redressing the defects of electoral&nbsp;methods ignore the essential fact that in any case a representative&nbsp;system can only result in a rather arbitrary approximation to&nbsp;correspondence with the opinions of the electorate. It is by&nbsp;no means certain even that “ proportional representation ” in&nbsp;any of its forms would always result in the return of a representative assembly reflecting with mathematical accuracy&nbsp;the balance of opinion in the electorate; and even if it did,&nbsp;the electors have a way of changing their opinions long before&nbsp;their representatives come up for re-election. It was stated&nbsp;before the British Royal Commission that in Belgium, in spite&nbsp;of “ proportional representation,” both in 1900 and in 1902&nbsp;a majority of members was returned by a minority of votes.&nbsp;While under majority rule, as Mr Augustine Birrell once remarked, “ minorities must suffer ”—even large minorities—&nbsp;it is on the other hand mot likely to conduce to the popularity&nbsp;of representative government that minorities should obtain&nbsp;too great a share of political power. The fact is that no&nbsp;“ representation ” can reflect the views of those “ represented ”&nbsp;as accurately as “ presentation ” by those entitled personally&nbsp;to speak. This conclusion, while in no necessary degree qualifying the importance of “ popular government,” undoubtedly&nbsp;detracts from the value of the representative method. The result&nbsp;is seen in the increasing desire in really democratic countries&nbsp;to supplement representative government by some form of&nbsp;Referendum, or direct appeal to the electors for their own&nbsp;personal opinion on a distinct issue—a method which involves&nbsp;fundamentally the addition of a “ presentative ” element to&nbsp;the representative system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature.—</span><span class="font1">-The number of separate works on various aspects of the theory, history and practice of political representation—a&nbsp;much wider subject than representative government—is too large&nbsp;for detailed mention. A general reference can only be made here&nbsp;to the standard treatises on constitutional law. The chapter&nbsp;in Sir G. Cornewall Lewis’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some&nbsp;Political Terms</span><span class="font1"> (Sir T. Raleigh's edition, 1898) should also be noted.&nbsp;In addition to works cited above, a valuable account of all parts&nbsp;of the electoral “ machine ” is given in M. Ostrogorski<sup>1</sup>S </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Democracy&nbsp;and the Organization of Political Parties</span><span class="font1"> (1902). The Congressional&nbsp;Library, Washington, U.S.A., issued in 1904 a “ List of Books relating to Proportional Representation,” which constitutes a complete&nbsp;bibliography of that subject up to that date. The best discussion&nbsp;of the various methods for securing adequate representation is,&nbsp;however, now to be found in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font1"> (1910) of the British Royal&nbsp;Commission on Systems of Election (Parliamentary Paper, Cd. 5163).&nbsp;It is chiefly valuable for its description of the devices in use in different&nbsp;countries and for its weighty criticism of the proposals for minority&nbsp;representation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ch.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPRIEVE </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(reprise,</span><span class="font2"> from Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reprendre),</span><span class="font2"> in English law, a term which originally meant remand to prison: later and&nbsp;more usually, the suspension for a time of the execution of a&nbsp;sentence passed on conviction of crime. The term is now seldom&nbsp;or never used except with reference to sentences of death. In&nbsp;the case of capital felonies other than murder the recording of&nbsp;sentence of death has the effect of a reprieve by the court. The&nbsp;court which can award a sentence is said to possess as of common&nbsp;right a discretionary power of granting a reprieve. Courts of&nbsp;justice, however, do not grant reprieves by way of dispensation&nbsp;from the penalties of the law, which is not for the judicial&nbsp;department, but for temporary purposes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> of appeal or inquiry&nbsp;as to the state of mind or health of the convict, or to enable him&nbsp;to apply for a pardon. Under the old system of transportation&nbsp;it was a common practice to reprieve convicted felons as a step&nbsp;to induce them to consent to transportation to the American&nbsp;colonies (see thc </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Old Bailey Regulations of 1662,</span><span class="font2"> J. Kelyng,&nbsp;ed. 1873, p. 1). In cases of conviction of wilful murder the&nbsp;reprieve, if any, is granted by the home secretary on behalf of&nbsp;the crown, and on convictions of murder the court seems now to&nbsp;have no power to reprieve except in the case of a pregnant&nbsp;woman.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REPRISALS (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">représailles,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reprendre*,</span><span class="font2"> Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repre-hendere,</span><span class="font2"> to take back), properly speaking, the act of forcibly seizing something belonging to another state by way of retalia-, tion, but currently used for the retaliation itself. They are acts&nbsp;of violence which are a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">casus belli</span><span class="font2"> according to the manner in&nbsp;which the state against which they are exercised regards them&nbsp;and is able to resist or resent them. Two comparatively recent&nbsp;cases have occurred in which this form of redress was resorted&nbsp;to. In the one case a demand by the British government for&nbsp;an indemnity for injuries inflicted on the British vice-consul&nbsp;and certain other British subjects by Nicaraguan authorities&nbsp;in the Mosquito reserve not having been complied with, British&nbsp;naval forces were landed on April 27th, 1895, at Corinto, where&nbsp;they occupied the customs house and other public buildings&nbsp;till an agreement was arrived at. In the other case the French&nbsp;government in November 1901 ordered the occupation by French&nbsp;naval forces of the customs house at Mytilene until redress was&nbsp;obtained for divers claims of French citizens. A Hague Convention of 1907 now places limitations on the employment of&nbsp;force for the recovery of contract debts, and forbids recourse&nbsp;to armed force unless “ the debtor state refuses or neglects to&nbsp;reply to an offer of arbitration, or after accepting the offer prevents&nbsp;any </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">compromise</span><span class="font2"> from being agreed on, or after arbitration fails&nbsp;to submit to the award ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(art.</span><span class="font2"> 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ba.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPRODUCTION, in biology, the generation of new organisms from existing organisms more or less similar. It is a special case of growth, and consists of an increase of living substance&nbsp;in such fashion that the new substance is either set free as a new&nbsp;individual, or, whilst remaining attached to the parent organism,&nbsp;separated by some sort of partition so as to have a subordinate&nbsp;individuality. Y. Delage has distinguished as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">multiplication&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">those cases in which the new individual arises from a mass of&nbsp;cells which remain a part of the maternal tissues during differentiation, reserving the term </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reproduction</span><span class="font2"> for those cases in&nbsp;which the spore or cell which is the starting-point of the new&nbsp;individual begins by separating from the maternal tissues;&nbsp;but the distinction is inconvenient in practice and does not&nbsp;appear to carry with it any fundamental biological significance.&nbsp;The general relation between parent and filial organisms is&nbsp;discussed under </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heredity</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Embryology;</span><span class="font2"> many of the&nbsp;details of the cellular processes are dealt with under </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cytology,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and the modes of reproduction exhibited by different kinds of&nbsp;animals and plants are treated of in the various articles describing&nbsp;individual groups. Finally, some of the special problems involved&nbsp;are discussed under the heading </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sex. As</span><span class="font2"> reproduction is a&nbsp;general biological phenomenon, its manifestations should be&nbsp;dealt with simultaneously in the case of animals and plants,&nbsp;but many of the special details differ so much that it is practically&nbsp;convenient to make two headings.</span></p>
