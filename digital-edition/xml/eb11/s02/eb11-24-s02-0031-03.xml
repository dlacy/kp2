Here St Maurus towards the middle of the 6th century founded the first Benedictine monastery in Gaul. About the middle of the 9th century it was reduced to ruins by the Normans ; in anticipation of the disaster the relics of the saint were transferred to the abbey of Fossés (afterwards St Maur-des-Fossés: see above). St Maur-sur-Loire was afterwards restored and fortified; the extant remains consist of a part of the church (12th and 17th centuries) and buildings of the 17th and 18th centuries.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
