<p><label>RICAUT</label>
or Rycaut, Sir Paul, an eminent English traveller, of the time of whose birth we find no account ; but in 1661 he was appointed secretary to the Earl of Win-chelsea, who was sent ambassador extraordinary to Turkey. During his continuance in that station he wrote “ The Present State of the Ottoman Empire, in three books, containing the maxims of the Turkish policy, their religion, and military discipline,” London, 1670; and he afterwards resided eleven years as consul at Smyrna, where, at the command of Charles II., he composed “ The Present State of the Greek and Arminian Churches, <hi rend="italic">anno Christi</hi> 1678.” On his return, Lord Clarendon being appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, made him his principal secretary for Leinster and Connaught. King James II. knighted him, and made him one of the privy council in Ireland, and judge of the court of admiralty. These appointments he held till the Revolution. He was employed by King William as resident at the Hanse Towns, in Lower Saxony, where he continued for ten years ; but being worn out with age and infirmities, he obtained leave to return in 1700, and died the same year. Ricaut continued Knolles's History of the Turks, and Platina’s Lives of the Popes ; besides which there are some other productions which bear his name.</p>
