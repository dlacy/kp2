a precious ſtone conſiſting of a mixture of the chalcedony and carnelian, ſometimes in ſtrata, but at other times blended together. It is found, I. Striped with white and red ſtrata, which may be cut in <hi rend="italic">cameo</hi> as well as the onyx. 2. White with red dentritioal figures, greatly reſembling the mocha-ſtone; but with this difference, that the figures in the ſardonyx are of a red colour, in the other black. There is no real difference, excepting in the circumſtance of hardneſs, between the onyx, carnelian, chalcedony, ſardonyx, and agate, notwithſtanding the different names beſtowed upon them. Mongez informs us, that the yellow, or orange-coloured agates, with a wavy or undulating ſurface, are now commonly called ſardonyx.
