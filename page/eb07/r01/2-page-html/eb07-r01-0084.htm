<p><span class="font0">only on account of its narrowness at the mouth, which re-' quires an extremely favourable wind, but from the rocks and shoals which lie off it in every direction. By this port&nbsp;hosts of pilgrims and slaves come from the interior of Africa&nbsp;for the purpose of crossing to Jidda and Mecca. Massuah&nbsp;is about 250 miles south-east of Suakim, and is the port of&nbsp;Abyssinia, by which its whole commerce is carried on. The&nbsp;Red Sea penetrating on the one side so deep into the land&nbsp;between the continents of Asia and Africa, and the great&nbsp;inlet of the Mediterranean on the other between Europe&nbsp;and Africa, appear to be admirably adapted for facilitating&nbsp;the commerce and maritime intercourse of the world ; and&nbsp;though the intervention of the Isthmus of Suez detracts&nbsp;from their utility, yet, in ancient times, the great trade of&nbsp;Europe and India was carried on through this channel. By&nbsp;the Red Sea also the fleets of Solomon maintained an intercourse with the celebrated countries of Ophir and Tarshish ;&nbsp;the situation of which is variously conjectured to be either&nbsp;on the coast of Africa beyond the straits, or on the western&nbsp;shores of Hindustan. The trade of the ancient world with&nbsp;India was carried on entirely by this route ; and Alexandria&nbsp;became the great emporium of eastern produce, from which it&nbsp;was distributed by means of the Mediterranean all over Europe. This trade flourished greatly under the reign of the&nbsp;Ptolemies, who succeeded in establishing a regular communication both with Africa and with Hindustan. It was&nbsp;long a source of great commercial ¼<sup>τ</sup>ealth, and was vigorously&nbsp;prosecuted during the whole period that the Roman empire subsisted. But it was long suspended by the overthrow&nbsp;of the Roman power, and during the irruptions of the barbarian hordes, who carried their devastations over the greater part of the civilized world. With literature and refinement commerce revived; and the Venetians established&nbsp;factories at Alexandria, by which they carried on the trade&nbsp;to India through the channel of the Red Sea. Since this&nbsp;period the discovery of the passage to India by the Cape&nbsp;of Good Hope has entirely superseded the route by the&nbsp;Red Sea, and changed the course of the trade to India.&nbsp;But in modern times the introduction of steam-navigation&nbsp;will probably revive the long-abandoned route to India by&nbsp;the Red Sea. The baffling winds which, for nine months&nbsp;in the year, impeded the passage up this sea, will now be&nbsp;overcome by the superior power of steam, nor will the&nbsp;calms which sometimes prevail oppose any further obstacle&nbsp;to its navigation ; whilst the route, being so much shorter than&nbsp;by the long circuit round the Cape of Good Hope, may be&nbsp;accomplished in a much shorter time, and is on every account to be preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea has furnished matter for much curious research and ingenious&nbsp;speculation. Bruce, in his Travels, states, that at the&nbsp;place where he supposes the passage to have been made&nbsp;the sea is not quite four leagues in breadth, so that it&nbsp;might easily have been crossed in one night without any&nbsp;miracle. There are about fourteen fathoms water in the&nbsp;channel, and nine at the sides, with good anchorage everywhere ; the farthest side is a low sandy coast, and a very&nbsp;easy landing place. “ The draught of the bottom of the&nbsp;gulf,” says he, “ given by Dr Pococke, is very' erroneous&nbsp;in every part of it. It was proposed to Mr Niebuhr, when&nbsp;in Egypt, to inquire, upon the spot, whether there were not&nbsp;some ridges of rocks where the water was shallow, so that&nbsp;an army at particular times might pass over; secondly,&nbsp;whether file Etesian winds, which blow strongly all summer from the north-west, could not blow so violently against&nbsp;the sea as to keep it back on a heap, so that the Israelites&nbsp;might have passed without a miracle. And a copy of&nbsp;these queries was left for me to join my inquiries likewise.&nbsp;But I must confess, however learned the gentlemen were&nbsp;who proposed these doubts, I did not think they merited&nbsp;any attention to solve them. If the Etesian winds, blowing from the north-west in summer, could keep the sea as&nbsp;a wall on the right or to the south, of fifty feet high, still&nbsp;the difficulty would remain of building the wall on the left&nbsp;hand, or to the north. Besides, water standing in that position for a day must have lost the nature of a fluid. Whence&nbsp;came that cohesion of particles that hindered that wall to&nbsp;escape at the sides ? This is as great a miracle as that of&nbsp;Moses. If the Etesian winds had done this once, they must&nbsp;have repeated it many a time before and since from the same&nbsp;causes. Yet Diodorus Siculus says, the Troglodytes, the indigenous inhabitants of that very spot, have a tradition from&nbsp;father to son, from their very earliest and remotest ages, that&nbsp;once this division of the sea did happen there ; and that,&nbsp;after leaving the bottom some time dry, the sea again came&nbsp;back and covered it with great fury. The words of this&nbsp;author are of the most remarkable kind. W<sup>r</sup>e cannot think&nbsp;this heathen is writing in favour of revelation. He knew&nbsp;not Moses, nor says a word about Pharaoh and his host ;&nbsp;but records the miracle of the division of the sea in words&nbsp;nearly as strong as those of Moses, from the mouths of unbiassed Iindesigning pagans.”</span></p>
