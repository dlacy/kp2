<p><span class="font0">good rhubarb has been grown at Banbury from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum officinale, </span><span class="font0">but these two varieties are not equal in medicinal strength to&nbsp;the Chinese article, yielding less extract—Chinese rhubarb affording, according to </span><span class="font1">H. </span><span class="font0">Seier, 58%, English rhubarb 21% and&nbsp;R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">officinale</span><span class="font0"> 17%. In France the cultivation of rhubarb&nbsp;was commenced in the latter half of the 18th century—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. com-pactum,</span><span class="font0"> R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">palmatum,</span><span class="font0"> R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhaponticum</span><span class="font0"> and R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">undulatum</span><span class="font0"> being&nbsp;the species grown. The cultivation has, however, now nearly ceased,&nbsp;small quantities only being prepared at Avignon and a few other&nbsp;localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The culture of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum compactum</span><span class="font0"> was begun in Moravia in the beginning of the present century by Prikyl, an apothecary in&nbsp;Austerlitz, and until about fifty years ago the root was largely&nbsp;exported to Lyons and Milan, where it was used for dyeing silk.&nbsp;As a medicine 5 parts are stated to be equal to 4 of Chinese rhubarb.&nbsp;Rhubarb root is also grown at Auspitz in Moravia and at llmitz,&nbsp;Kremnitz and Frauenkirchen in Hungary; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ri emodi</span><span class="font0"> is said to be&nbsp;cultivated for the same purpose in Silesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhubarb is also prepared for use in medicine from wild species in the Himalayas and Java.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. The rhubarb used as a vegetable consists of the leaf stalks of R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhaponticum</span><span class="font1"> and its varieties, and R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">undulatum.</span><span class="font1"> It&nbsp;is known in America as pie-plant. Plants are readily raised&nbsp;from seed, but strong plants can be obtained in a much shorter&nbsp;time by dividing the roots. Divisions or seedlings are planted&nbsp;about 3 ft. apart in ground which has been deeply trenched&nbsp;and manured, the crowns being kept slightly above the surface. Rhubarb grows freely under fruit-trees, but succeeds&nbsp;best in an open situation in rich, rather light soil. The stalks&nbsp;should not be pulled during the first season. If a top-dressing of manure be given each winter a plantation will last good&nbsp;for several years. Forced rhubarb is much esteemed in winter&nbsp;and early spring, and forms a remunerative crop. Forcing&nbsp;under glass or in a mushroom house is most satisfactory, but&nbsp;open-ground forcing may be effected by placing pots or boxes&nbsp;over the roots and burying in a good depth of stable litter&nbsp;and leaves. Several other species, such as R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">palmatum,&nbsp;R. officinale,</span><span class="font1"> R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nobile</span><span class="font1"> and others, are cultivated for their&nbsp;fine foliage and handsome inflorescence, especially in wild&nbsp;gardens, margins of shrubberies and similar places. They&nbsp;succeed in most soils, but prefer a rich soil of good depth. They&nbsp;are propagated by seeds or by division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHYL, a watering-place and urban district of Flint, N. Wales, practically equidistant by rail from Bangor (29I m.)&nbsp;and Chester (30 m.), and 209 m. from London on the London&nbsp;&amp; North-Western railway. Pop. (1901) 8473. It is situated&nbsp;near the mouth of the Clwyd. Formerly, like Llandudno, </span><span class="font0">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">small fishing village, the town has now all the appointments&nbsp;of a popular resort. In winter the gales often fill the streets&nbsp;to the depth of several feet, with drifts of sand from the surrounding dunes, which, however, are noted in summer for&nbsp;the dry and bracing air. The neighbouring country is interesting from its scenery and antiquities. Among the institutions of the town may be mentioned the Queen Alexandra&nbsp;Hospital (1902), and several hydropathic establishments and&nbsp;convalescent homes. The estuary harbours coasting vessels,&nbsp;and some shipbuilding is carried on. On the beach towards&nbsp;Prestatyn can be seen the remains of a submerged forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHYME, more correctly spelt Rime, from a Provençal word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rim</span><span class="font1"> (its customary English spelling is due to a confusion with&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhythm],</span><span class="font1"> a literary ornament or device consisting of an identity&nbsp;of sound in the terminal syllables of two or more words. In&nbsp;the art of versification it signifies the repetition of a sound at&nbsp;the end of two or more lines in a single composition. This&nbsp;artifice was practically unknown to the ancients, and, when&nbsp;it occurs, or seems to occur, in the works of classic Greek and&nbsp;Latin poets, it must be considered to be accidental. The&nbsp;natural tendency of the writer of verse unconsciously to repeat&nbsp;a sound, however, is shown by the fact that there have been&nbsp;discovered nearly one thousand lines in the writings of VirgiI&nbsp;where the final syllable rhymes with a central one, thus—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bella per Emathios plus quam civilia campos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is more than doubtful, however, whether the difference of stress would not prevent this from sounding as a rhyme in&nbsp;an antique ear, and the phenomenon results more from the&nbsp;contingencies of grammar than from intention on the part of&nbsp;the poet. Conscious rhyme belongs to the early medieval&nbsp;periods of monkish literature, and the name given to lines&nbsp;with an intentional rhyme in the middle is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leonine verse,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the invention being attributed to a probably apocryphal monk&nbsp;Leoninus or Leonius, who is supposed to be the author of a&nbsp;history of the Old Testament preserved in the Bibliothèque&nbsp;Nationale of Paris. This “ history ” is composed in Latin&nbsp;verses, all of which rhyme in the centre. Another very famous&nbsp;poem in Lconine rhyme is the “ De Contemptu Mundi ” of&nbsp;Bernard of Cluny, which was printed at Bremen in 1595.&nbsp;Rhyme exists to satisfy the ear by the richness of repeated&nbsp;sound. In the beginnings of modem verse, alliteration, a&nbsp;repetition of a consonant, satisfied the listener. A further&nbsp;ornament was discovered when assonance, a repetition of the&nbsp;vowel-sounds, was invented. Finally, both of these were combined to procure a full identity of sound in the entire syllable,&nbsp;and rhyme took its place in prosody. When this identity of&nbsp;sound occurs in the last syllable of a verse it is the typical end-rhyme of modem European poetry. Recent criticism has been&nbsp;inclined to look upon the African church-Latin of the age of&nbsp;Tertullian as the starting-point of modern rhyme, and it is&nbsp;probable that the ingenuities of priests, invented to aid worshippers in hearing and singing long pieces of Latin verse in&nbsp;the ritual of the Catholic church produced the earliest conscious&nbsp;poems in rhyme. Moreover, not to give too great importance&nbsp;to the Leonine hexameters which have been mentioned above,&nbsp;it is certain that by the 4th century a school of rhymed sacred&nbsp;poetry had come into existence, classical examples of which&nbsp;we still possess in the “ Stabat Mater ” and the “ Dies Irae.”&nbsp;In the course of the middle ages, alliteration, assonance and&nbsp;end-rhyme held the field without a rival in vernacular poetry.&nbsp;There is no such thing, it may broadly be said, as medieval&nbsp;verse in which one or other of these distinguishing ornaments&nbsp;is not employed. After the 14th century, in the north of&nbsp;Europe, and indeed everywhere except in Spain, where assonance held a powerful position, end-rhyme became universal&nbsp;and formed a distinctive indication of metrical const ruction.&nbsp;It was not until the invention of Blank Verse </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vi)</span><span class="font1"> that rhyme&nbsp;found a modem rival, and in spite of the successes of this&nbsp;instrument rhyme has held its own, at all events for nondram atic verse, in the principal literature of Europe. Certain&nbsp;forms of poetry are almost inconceivable without rhyme.&nbsp;For instance, efforts have been made to compose rhymeless&nbsp;sonnets, but the result has been, either that the piece of blank&nbsp;verse produced is not in any sense a sonnet, or else that by&nbsp;some artifice the appearance of rhyme has been retained. In&nbsp;the heyday of Elizabethan literature a serious attempt was&nbsp;made in England to reject rhyme altogether, and to return to&nbsp;the quantitative measures of the ancients. The prime mover&nbsp;in this heresy was not a poet at all, but a pedantic grammarian&nbsp;of Cambridge, Gabriel Harvey (1545 ?-i63o). He considered&nbsp;himself a great innovator, and for a short time he actually&nbsp;seduced no less melodious a poet than Edmund Spenser to&nbsp;abandon rhyme and adopt a system of accented hexameters&nbsp;and trimeters. Spenser even wrote largely in those measures,&nbsp;but the greater portion of his experiments in this kind, of&nbsp;which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Dying Pelican</span><span class="font1"> is supposed to have been one, have&nbsp;disappeared. From 1576 to 1579 the genius of Spenser seems&nbsp;to have been obscured by this error of taste, but he shook&nbsp;it off completely when he composed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The ShepherPs Calendar.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Harvey considered Richard Stonyhurst (1547-1618) the most&nbsp;loyal of his disciples, and this author published in 1582 four&nbsp;books of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span><span class="font1"> translated into rhymeless hexameters on&nbsp;Harvey’s plan. The result remains, a portent of ugliness&nbsp;and cacophony. A far greater poet, Thomas Campion (1575-1620), returned to the attack, and in a tract published in 1602&nbsp;advocated the remission of rhyme from lyrical poetry. He,&nbsp;by dint of a prodigious effort, produced some unrhymed odes&nbsp;which were not without charm, but the best critics of the time,&nbsp;such as Daniel, repudiated the innovation, and rhyme continued&nbsp;to have no serious rival except blank verse.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
