The bark is very brown, ſmooth, pliant when green, and generally uſed in the weſt In-dia iſlands for tanning of leather. Below this bark lies a cuticle, or ſkin, which is lighter, thinner, and more tender. The wood is nearly of the ſame colour as the bark ; hard, pliant, and very heavy. It is frequently uſed for fuel, for which purpoſe it is ſaid to Be remark-ably proper: the fires which are made of this wood being both clearer, more ardent and durable than thoſe made of any other materials whatever.—The wood is compact; almoſt incorruptible ; never ſplinters ; is eaſily worked; and were it not for its enormous weight, would be commodiouſly employed in almoſt all kinds of work, as it poſſeſſes every property of good timber. To the roots and branclies of mangroves that are immerſed in the water, oyſters frequently attach themſelves ; ſo that wherever this curious plant is found growing on the ſea-ſhore, oyfter-fiſhing is very eaſy ; as in ſuch cafes theſe ſhell-fifh may be literally ſaid to be gathered upon trees.</p><p>The red mangle or mangrove grows on tlie ſea-ſhore, and at the mouth of large rivers ; but does not advance, like the former, into the water. It generally riſes to the height of 20 or 30 feet, with crooked, knotty branches, which proceed from all parts of the trunk. The balk is ſlender, of a brown colour, and, when young, is ſmooth, and adheres very cloſely to the wood ; but when old, appears quite cracked, and is eaſily detached from it. Under this bark is a ſkin as thick as parchment, red, and adhering cloſely to the wood, from which it cannot be detached till the tree is felled and dry. The wood is hard, compact, heavy, of a deep red, with a very fine grain. The pith or heart of the wood being cut into ſmall pieces, and boiled in water, imparts a very beautiful red to the li-quid, which communicates the ſame colour to wool and linen. The great weight and hardneſs of the wood prevents it from being generally uſed. From the fruit of this tree, which, when ripe, is of a violet colour, and reſembles ſome grapes in taſte, is prepared an agreeable liquor, much eſteemed by the inhabitants of the Caribbee iſſands.</p><p>white mangle, ſo termed from the colour of its wood, grow, like the two former, upon the banks of rivers, but is ſeldom found near the ſea. The bark is grey ; the wood, as we have ſaid, white, and when green, ſupple ; but dries as ſoon as cut down, and be-comes very light and brittle. This ſpecies is generally called <hi rend="italic">rope-mangrove,</hi>  from the uſe to which the bark is applied by the inhabitants of the weſt Indies. This bark, which, by reaſon of the great abundance of ſap, is eaſily detached when green from the wood, is beaten or bruiſed betwixt two ſtones, until the hard and woody part is totally ſeparated from that which is ſoft and tender. This laſt, which is the true cortical ſubſtance, is twiſted into ropes of all ſizes, which are exceedingly ſtrong, and not apt to rot in the water.</p><p>RHODES, a celebrated iſland in the Archipelago, the largeſt and moſt eaſterly of the Cyclades, was known in ancient times by the names of <hi rend="italic">Aſteria, 0-phiuſa, Æthrœa, Trinacria, Corymbia, Poeſſa, Atabyria, Marcia, Oloeſſa, Stadia Telchinis, Pelagia,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Rhodus. </hi>In later ages, the name of <hi rend="italic">Rhodus,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Rhodes,</hi>  prevailed, from the Greek word <hi rend="italic">rhodon,</hi>as is commonly ſup-poſed, ſignifying a " roſe the iſland abounding very much with theſe flowers. Others, however, give differ-ent etymologies, among which it is difficult to find one preferable to another. It is about 20 miles diſtant from the coaſts of Lycia and Caria, and about 120 miles in compaſs.</p><p>Several ancient authors aſſert, that Rhodes was formerly covered by the ſea, but gradually raiſed its head above the waves, aud became au iſland. Delos and Rhodes (ſays Pliny), iſlands which have long been * celebrated, ſprung at firſt from the ſea. The ſame fact is ſupported by ſuch a variety of other evidence as render it indubitable. Philo f aſcribes the event to the decreaſe of the waters of the ocean. If his conjecture be not without foundation, moſt of the iſles of the Archipelago, being lower than Rhodes, muſt have had a ſimilar origin. But it is much more probable that the volcanic fires, which in the fourth year of the 135th O-lympiad, raiſed Theraſia and Thera, known at preſent by the name of <hi rend="italic">Santorin,</hi>  from the depths of the ſea, and have in our days thrown out ſeveral ſmall iſſands adjacent, alſo produced in ſome ancient era Rhodes and Delos.</p><p>The firſt inhabitants of Rhodes, according to Diodorus Siculus, were called the <hi rend="italic">Telchinœ,</hi>  who came originally from the iſland of Crete. Theſe, by their ſkill in aſtrology, perceiving that the iſland was ſoon to be drowned with water, left their habitations, and made room for the Heliades, or grandſons of Phœbus, who took poſſeſſion of the iſland after that god had cleared it from the water and mud with which it was over-whelmed. Theſe Heliades, it ſeems. excelled all other men in learning, and eſpecially in aſtrology ; invented navigation, &amp;c. In after ages, however, being infeſt-ed with great ſerpents which bred in the iſſand, they had recourſe to an oracle in Delos, which adviſed them to admit Phorbas, a Theſſalian, with his followers, into Rhodes. This was accordingly done ; and Phorbas having deſtroyed the ſerpents, was, after his death, honoured as a demigod. Afterwards a colony of Cretans ſettled in ſome part of the iſſand, and a little before the Trojan war, Tlepolinius the ſon of Hercules, who was made king of the whole iſland, and governed with great juſtice and moderation.</p><p>After the Trojan war, all the ancient inhabitants were driven out by the Dorians, who continued to be maſters of the iſland for many ages. The government was at firſt monarchical ; but a little before the expedition of Xerxes into Greece, a republican form of go-vernment was introduced ; during which the Rhodians applied themſelves to navigation, and became very powerful by ſea, planting ſeveral colonies in diſtant. countries. In the time of the Peloponneſian war, the republic of Rhodes was rent into two factions, one of which favoured the Athenians, and another the Spar-tans ; but at length the latter prevailing, democracy was aboliſhed, and an ariſtocracy introduced. About 351 B. C. we ſind the Rhodians oppreſſed by Mauſo-lus king of Caria, and at laſt reduced by Artemiſia his widow. In this emergency, they applied to the Athenians ; by whoſe aſſiſtance, probably, they regained their liberty.</p><p>From this time to that of Alexander the Great, the Rhodians enjoyed an uninterrupted tranquillity. To him they voluntarily ſubmitted ; and were on that ac</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
