(Ælius), a native of Vulſinum in Tuſcany, who diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the court of Tiberius. His father’s name was Seius Strabo; a Roman knight, commander of the pretorian guards. His mother was deſcended from the Junian family. Sejanus firſt gained the favours of Caius Cæſar, the grandſon of Auguſtus, but afterwards he attached himſelf to the intereſt and the views of Tiberius, who then ſat on the imperial throne. The emperor, who was naturally of a ſuſpicious temper, was free and open with Sejanus, and while he diſtruſted others, he communicated his greateſt ſecrets to this fawning favourite. Sejanus improved this confidence; and when he had found that he poſſeſſed the eſteem of Tiberius, he next endeavoured to become the favourite of the ſoldiers, and the darling of the ſenate. As commander of the pretorian guards he was the ſecond man in Rome, and in that important office he made uſe of inſinuations and every mean artifice to make himſelf beloved and revered. His affability and condeſcenſion gained him the hearts of the common ſoldiers, and, by appointing his own favourites and adherents to places of truſt and honour, all the officers and centurions of the army became devoted to his intereſt. The views of Sejanus in this were well known; yet, to advance with more ſucceſs, he attempted to gain the affection of the ſenators. In this he met with no oppoſition. A man who has the diſpoſal of places of honour and dignity, and who has the command of the public money, cannot but be the favourite of thoſe who are in need of his aſſiſtance. It is even ſaid, that Sejanus gained to his views all the wives of the ſenators, by a private and moſt ſecret promiſe of marriage to each of them, whenever he had made himſelf independent and ſovereign of Rome. Yet, however ſucceſsful with the beſt and nobleſt families in the empire, Sejanus had to combat numbers in the houſe of the emperor; but theſe ſeeming obſtacles were ſoon removed. All the children and grandchildren of Tiberius were ſacrificed to the ambition of the favourite under various pretences; and Druſus the ſon of the emperor, by ſtriking Sejanus, made his deſtruction ſure and inevitable. Livia, the wife of Druſus, was gained by Sejanus; and, though the mother of many children, ſhe was prevailed upon to aſſiſt her adulterer in the murder of her huſband, and</p><p>ſhe conſented to marry him when Druſus was dead. No ſooner was Druſus poiſoned, than Sejanus openly declared his wiſh to marry Livia. This was ſtrongly oppoſed by Tiberius; and the emperor, by recommending Germanicys to the ſenators for his ſucceſſor, rendered Sejanus hold and determined. He was more urgent in his demands; and when he could not gain the conſent of the emperor, he perſuaded him to retire to ſolitude from the noiſe of Rome and the troubles of the government. Tiberius, naturally fond of eaſe and luxury, yielded to his repreſentations and retired to Campania, leaving Sejanus at the head of the empire. This was highly gratifying to the favourite, but he was not without a maſter. Prudence and moderation might have made him what he wiſhed to be; but having offended the emperor beyond forgiveneſs, he reſolved to retrieve his loſs, and by one vigorous effort to decide the fate of the empire. He called together his friends and followers; he paid<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0254.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0248"/>
court to ſuch as ſeemed diſſaffected ; he held forth rewards and promiſes ; and, having increaſed the number of his partiſans, formed a bold conſpiracy, reſolved by any means to ſeize the ſovereign power.</p><p>A powerrul league was formed with aſtoniſhing rapidity, and great numbers of all deſcriptions, ſenators as well as military men, entered into the plot.<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Murphy's Tacitus, Book V.</p></note> Among theſe, Satrius Secundus was the confidential friend and prime agent of the miniſter: Whatever was this man’s motive, whether fear, or views of intereſt, or ingratitude (for no principle of honour can be imputed to him), he reſolved to betray the ſecret to Tiberius. For this purpoſe he addreſſed himſelf to Antonia, the daughter of Anthony the triumvir, the widow of Druſus, and the mother of Germanicus. When this illuſtrious woman, who was honoured by the court and revered by the people, heard the particulars, ſhe ſent diſpatches to the emperor by one of her ſlaves. Tiberius was aſtoniſhed, but not diſmayed. The danger preſſed ; his habitual ſlowneſs was out of ſeaſon ; the time called for vigour and deciſive meaſures. He ſent Macro to Rome, with a ſpecial commiſſion to take upon him the command of the praetorian guards. He added full inſtructions for his conduct in all emergencies. Early in the morning on the 15th, before the kalends of November, a report was ſpread, that letters had arrived at Rome, in which the emperor ſignified his intention to aſſociate Sejanus with himſelf in the tribunitian power. The ſenate was ſummoned to meet in the temple of Apollo, near the imperial palace. Sejanus attended without delay. A party of the praetorians followed him. Macro met him in the veſtibule of the temple. He approached the miniſter with all demonſtrations of profound reſpect, and taking him aſide, “ Be not ſurpriſed (he ſaid) that you have no letter from the prince : it is his pleaſure to declare you his colleague in the tribunitian power ; but he thinks that a matter of ſo much importance ſhould be communicated to the lathers by the voice of the conſuls. I am going to deliver the emperor’s orders.” Sejanus, elated with joy, and fluffed with his new dignity, entered the ſenate-houſe ; Macro followed him. As soon as the conſuls arrived, he delivered the letter from Tiberius, and immediately went forth to the praetorian guards. He informed them, that by order of the prince, a large donative was to be diſtributed among the ſoldiers. He added, that, by a new commiſſion, he himſelf was appointed their commanding officer ; and, if they followed him to the camp, they would there receive the promiſed bounty. The lure was not thrown out in vain : the praetorian guards quitted their ſta- tion. Laco, who ſtood near at hand, immediately ſurrounded the ſenate-houſe with a body of the city cohorts.</p><p>The letter to the conſuls was confuſed, obſcure, and tedious, only glancing at Sejanus, till at laſt the language of invective left no room for doubt. Sejanus kept his ſeat like a man benumbed, ſenſeleſs and ſtupid with aſtoniſhment. His friends, who a little before congratulated him on his new dignity, deſerted him on every side. He was commanded by the conſul to rise and follow him, and being loaded with irons, was conducted to priſon. His downfal filled the city with exultation. The populace, who worſhipped him in the hour of proſperity, rejoiced to ſee the sad cataſtrophe to which he was now reduced. They followed in crowds,</p><p>rending the air with ſhouts, and pouring forth a torrent of abuſe and ſcurrilous language. The priſoner endeavoured to hide his face ; but the mob delighted to ſee remorſe and ſhame and guilt and horror in every feature of his distracted countenance. Thev reviled him for his acts of cruelty ; they laughed at his wild ambition ; they tore down his images, and daſhed his ſtatues to pieces. He was doomed by Tiberius to ſuffer death on that very day ; but, as he had a powerful faction in the ſenate, it was not thought advisable, for the mere formality of a regular condemnation, to hazard a debate. Private orders were given to Macro to diſpatch him without delay ; but the conſul, ſeeing the diſpoſitions of the people, and the calm neutrality of the prætorian guards, judged it best to re-aſſemble the fathers. They met in the temple of Concord. With one voice Sejanus was condemned to die, and the ſentence was executed without delay. He was ſtrangled in the priſon. His body was dragged to the Gemoniæ, and, after every ſpecies of inſult from the populace, at the end of three days was thrown into the Tiber. Such was the tragic end of that ambitious favourite. He fell a terrible example to all, who, in any age or country, may hereafter endeavour by their <hi rend="italic">vices to</hi> rise above their fellow-citizens.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
