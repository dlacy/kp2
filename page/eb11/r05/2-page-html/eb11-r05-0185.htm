<p><span class="font0">by small bodies of the enemy, and he failed to co-opcrate, with the result that the attack from the north was repulsed.&nbsp;The Turkish commander, however, evacuated the pass that&nbsp;night (July i8th/i9th). It was occupied by the Russians on&nbsp;July 19th, and held till the end of the war. Gurko’s detachment was followed across the Danube bridge by the XII. and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">XIII. Array Corps, which crossed between July 3rd and 8th&nbsp;and moved towards the Jantra river; the IX. Corps was across&nbsp;by July 10th and advanced on Nikopol; the XI. Corps crossed&nbsp;July ioth-isth; and finally the IV. Corps between July 20th&nbsp;and 30th. The VIII. Corps had meanwhile advanced on&nbsp;Timova, as we have seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On July 3rd Abdul Kerim received orders from Constantinople to advance against the Russians, and set out with the force from Shumla for Rustchuk, immediately preceded by the&nbsp;cavalry division. Still no attempt was made to gain contact&nbsp;with the Russians and discover their intentions. From Rustchuk, Abdul Kerim advanced towards the Jantra, and after&nbsp;a skirmish between the Turkish cavalry and a Russian cavalry&nbsp;brigade again retired. Realizing Abdul Kerim’s incapacity,&nbsp;and rendered anxious by Gurko’s successful advance, the&nbsp;authorities at Constantinople now decided to give the command to Mehemet Ali. He superseded Abdul Kerim on July&nbsp;19th, and at once ordered the concentration of all available&nbsp;forces at Rasgrad. Meanwhile Osman Pasha, who had till now&nbsp;been condemned to inactivity at Vidin, received permission to&nbsp;march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vidin, with its modem fortifications and heavy armament, and with the Danube on one side and marshy ground towards&nbsp;the interior, was a place of considerable strength. But with&nbsp;the Russians south of the Danube there could no longer be any&nbsp;justification for keeping Osman’s 30,000 men isolated. Leaving&nbsp;garrisons in Vidin and the other towns along the Danube from&nbsp;Nikopol to Rakovitza, and to bar the roads from Servia, Osman&nbsp;left Vidin with the remaining 19 battalions, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6</span><span class="font0"> squadrons and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;batteries on July 13th. His original plan was to join the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battalions under Hairi Pasha, then garrisoning Nikopol,&nbsp;and attack the Russian flank between Biela and Timova; but&nbsp;on July 15th he received news that the Russians were attacking&nbsp;Nikopol, and he then decided to march straight to Plevna,&nbsp;where there was a garrison of 3000 men under Atouf Pasha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Osman reached Plevna (g.t&gt;.) on July 19th, and at once took up a position which had been previously&nbsp;reconnoitred by Atouf Pasha, on the hills to the&nbsp;north-east and east of the town. He had arrived just in time.&nbsp;On July 16th the Russian IX. Corps had taken Nikopol, and&nbsp;on the 18th orders were received to occupy Plevna with one&nbsp;division. At 5 a.m. on July 20th General Schilder-Sehuldner, with&nbsp;the 5th Division IX. Corps and other forces, attacked Osman’s&nbsp;position. No preliminary reconnaissance was made, and the&nbsp;Russians, after an artillery bombardment lasting about an&nbsp;hour, attacked at four points with separate columns. By&nbsp;midday the Russians were in retreat, having lost over 2800&nbsp;men. There was no pursuit. On July 20th Osman was reinforced by fourteen battalions from Sofia, and the following day&nbsp;sent Rifaat Pasha with six battalions, a battery and some&nbsp;Circassian cavalry to occupy Lovcha in order to secure his</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">communications with Sofia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Osman’s force at Plevna, within three days* march of the one Russian bridge over the Danube and flanking their fine&nbsp;of operations, could not be neglected, and General Krudener,&nbsp;commanding the IX. Corps, received orders to attack again&nbsp;as soon as possible. After the battle of the 20th he had been&nbsp;reinforced by brigades of the IV. and XII. Corps and a cavalry&nbsp;division. With this force, 30,000 in all, he attacked&nbsp;on July 30th. Krudener advanced in two columns,&nbsp;cavalry covering both flanks. Skobelev, with the&nbsp;cavalry on the southern flank, was subsequently reinforced by&nbsp;infantry, so there were practically three columns of attack. A&nbsp;general reserve of one brigade was kept at Karagatsch (16 m.&nbsp;east of Plevna). After an artillery engagement which lasted&nbsp;from 8.30 a.m. till 2.30 p.m. the infantry advanced. The&nbsp;fighting lasted till sunset, when the Russians withdrew to&nbsp;Karagatsch, having lost 7300 officers and men. The Turkish&nbsp;casualties were 2000. General Krudener, having reconnoitred&nbsp;the position, had hesitated to attack with the force available,&nbsp;and only acted in obedience to the orders received from headquarters, then 80 m. distant at Timova. His defeat was an&nbsp;unpleasant surprise for the Russians. Their plans were rudely&nbsp;upset, and their attention was now directed solely to the taking&nbsp;of Plevna. Headquarters were moved from Timova back to&nbsp;Bulgareni, Gurko was called back from south of the Balkans,&nbsp;the Rumanian army was called in to co-operate, orders were&nbsp;issued for the Guards and Grenadier Corps and the 24th and&nbsp;26th infantry divisions to mobilize, 188,000 of the 1st Ban&nbsp;militia and three divisions of the reserve were called out, and&nbsp;the 2nd and 3rd infantry divisions and the 3rd Rifle Brigade&nbsp;from Moscow district, where they had been mobilized, were at&nbsp;once ordered to the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this time the position of the Russians was as follows: the XIV. and part of the VII. Corps were north of the Danube,&nbsp;covering the communications; the IV. and IX. Corps were&nbsp;opposed to Osman Pasha at Plevna and his garrisons of Lovcha&nbsp;and Orchanie (the advanced depot of the Plevna force); the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">XI., XII. and XIII. Corps were along the White Lom facing Mehemet Ali, who was on the line Rasgrad-Eski Djuma with a&nbsp;force of about 80,000 infantry with 60 guns and a few regiments&nbsp;of cavalry, in addition to the garrisons of the fortresses; a small&nbsp;garrison on the Shipka Pass. Gurko was south of the Balkans,&nbsp;where Suleiman Pasha had a force of some 30/200 men. The&nbsp;Russian casualties since the commencement had reached 15,000,&nbsp;and their numbers south of the Danube did not exceed 130,000.&nbsp;Suleiman Pasha could have joined Osman or Mehemet Ali,&nbsp;avoiding the Shipka, and a vigorous offensive against the&nbsp;Russian flank at that time held out every prospect of success.&nbsp;The Shipka Pass would of necessity have been evacuated, but&nbsp;all through we find the Turkish commanders with their eyes&nbsp;fixed on geographical, which were sometimes strategical, points,&nbsp;and losing sight of the fact that the Russian army was their&nbsp;first objective. It is true that the ministers at Constantinople&nbsp;were largely responsible for the faulty strategy, but the generals&nbsp;in the field were also to blame. It was the moment for vigorous&nbsp;action on the part of the Turks. The moral equilibrium of the&nbsp;enemy was upset and the whole army demoralized by this&nbsp;second defeat at Plevna, but not a move was made. Again&nbsp;Osman failed to pursue. He was weak in cavalry, but he had&nbsp;sufficient to keep in touch with the enemy, who were utterly&nbsp;demoralized, and could have followed on with his whole force.&nbsp;He was but 35 m. distant from Sistova, and the result of&nbsp;the demolition of the bridge would have been incalculable. He&nbsp;was subsequently forbidden by Constantinople to assume the&nbsp;offensive, but it was not necessary to consult ministers as to&nbsp;pursuit after a successful battle, and they cannot be held responsible for this. The other Turkish commanders received&nbsp;news of the results of the battles of Plevna with incredulity, and&nbsp;likewise failed to turn them to account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">South of the Balkans was Suleiman’s army. He was ordered from Montenegro on July 1st, and, leaving garrisons along the&nbsp;Montenegrin frontier, embarked at Antivari on July 15th.&nbsp;Disembarking at Dedeagatch on the 21st, he moved thence&nbsp;by train to Adrianople. His command, increased by some&nbsp;15 battalions under Reouf Pasha, raised in the Balkan zone,&nbsp;amounted to approximately 30,000 men, and he was ordered to&nbsp;retake the Shipka Pass and to join Osman Pasha. Suleiman&nbsp;arrived at Karabunar on July 20th and moved to Eski Sagra,&nbsp;where he was joined by Reouf Pasha. Gurko, who had been&nbsp;resting about the Shipka Pass, ignorant of the arrival of Suleiman, moved against Reouf Pasha on the 27th of July, and found&nbsp;himself confronted by their combined forces on the 31st. He&nbsp;was attacked by Suleiman that day and was forced to retire.&nbsp;His force consisted of 15,000 men, including six battalions of&nbsp;Bulgarian volunteers which had just been raised. The following&nbsp;day he retreated across the Balkans by Hainkioi, where he left&nbsp;two brigades to hold the Hainkioi and Elena Passes, the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
