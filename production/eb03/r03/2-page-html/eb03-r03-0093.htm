<p><span class="font0">tnidable, that none of the neighbouring nations could hope to make a total conqueſt of it. The Poles and&nbsp;Swedes indeed continued to be very formidable enemies ;&nbsp;and, by the inſtigation of the former, the Crirn Tartars,&nbsp;in 157τ, again invaded the country with an army of&nbsp;70,000 men. The Ruffians, who might have prevented their paſſing the Volga, retired before them till they&nbsp;came within 18 miles of the city of Moſcow, where they&nbsp;were totally defeated. The Czar no ſooner heard this&nbsp;news than he retired with his moſt valuable effects to a&nbsp;well-fortified cloyſter ; upon which the Tartars entered&nbsp;the city, plundered it, and ſet fire to ſeveral churches.&nbsp;A violent ſtorm which happened at the ſame lime ſoon&nbsp;ſpread the flames all over the city ; which was entirely&nbsp;reduced to aſhes in fix hours, though its circumference&nbsp;was upwards of 40 miles. The fire likewiſe communicated· itſelf to a powder-magazine at ſome diſtance from&nbsp;the city ; by which accident upwards of 50 rods of the&nbsp;city wall, with all the buildings upon it, were deſtroyed ; and, according to the beſt hiſtorians, upwards of&nbsp;x20,000 citizens were burnt or buried in the ruins, befides women, children, and foreigners. The caſtle,&nbsp;however, vyhich was ſtrongly fortified, could not be&nbsp;taken; and the Tartars hearing that a formidable army&nbsp;was coming againſt them under the command of Magnus duke of Holſtein, whom Bafilovitz had made king&nbsp;of Livonia, thought proper to retire. The war, never-theleſs, continued with the Poles and Swedes ; and the&nbsp;Czar being defeated by the latter after ſome trifling&nbsp;ſucceſs, was reduced to the neceſſity of ſuing for peace.&nbsp;But the negotiations being ſomehow or other broken&nbsp;off, the war was renewed with the greateſt vigour.&nbsp;The Livonians, Poles, and Swedes, having united in a&nbsp;league together againſt the Ruffians, gained great advantages over them; and, in 1579, Stephen Battori,&nbsp;who was then raiſed to the throne of Poland, levied an&nbsp;army expreſsly with a deſign of invading Ruſſia, and of&nbsp;regaining all that Poland had formerly claimed, which&nbsp;indeed was little leſa than the whole empire. Aa the&nbsp;Roles underſtood the art of war much better than the&nbsp;Ruffians, Bafilovitz found his undiſeiplined multitudes&nbsp;unable to cope with the regular forces of his enemies :&nbsp;and their conqueſts were fo rapid, that he was ſoon&nbsp;obliged to ſue for peace : which, however, was not&nbsp;granted ; and it is poſſible that the number of enemies&nbsp;which now attacked Ruſſia might have overcome the&nbsp;empire entirely, had not the allies grown jealous of each&nbsp;other; the conſequence of which was, that in 1582 a&nbsp;peace was concluded with the Poles, in which the Swedes&nbsp;were not comprehended. However, the Swedes finding themſelves unable to effect any thing of moment after&nbsp;the deſertion of their allies, were fain to conclude a truce ;&nbsp;ſhortly after which the Czar, having been worſted in an&nbsp;engagement with the Tartars, died in the year 1584.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This great prince was ſucceeded by his ſon Theodore Ivanovitfc ; a man of ſuch weak underſtanding, that he was totally unfit for government. Under him,&nbsp;therefore, the Ruffian affairs fell into confuſion ; and&nbsp;Boris Gudenov, a nobleman whoſe fiſter Theodore&nbsp;had married, found means to affume all the authority.&nbsp;At laſt, unable to bear even the name of a ſuperior, he&nbsp;reſolved to uſurp the throne. For this purpoſe he&nbsp;cauſed the Czar’s brother Demetrius, at that time only&nbsp;•nine years of age, to be affaſſinated ; and afterwards,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">knowing that no truſt could be put in an aſſaffin, he&nbsp;cauſed </span><span class="font0">him alfo </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">be murdered left he ſhould divulge&nbsp;the ſecret. In 1597 the Czar himſelf was taken ill&nbsp;and died, not without great ſuſpicion of his being poi-ſoned by Gudenov ; of which indeed the Czarina was&nbsp;ſo well convinced, that ſhe would never afterwards&nbsp;ſpeak to her brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With Theodore ended' the line of Ruric, who had governed the empire of Ruſſia for upwards of 700&nbsp;years. Boris, who in reality was poffeffed of all the&nbsp;power, and would indeed have ſuffered nobody elſe to&nbsp;reign, artfully pretended to be unwilling to accept the&nbsp;crown, till compelled to it by the intreaties of the&nbsp;people ; and even then he put the acceptance of it on&nbsp;the iffue of an expedition which he was about to undertake againſt the Tartars. The truth of the matter,&nbsp;however, was, that no Tartar army was in the field,&nbsp;nor had Boris any intention of invading that country ;&nbsp;but by this pretence he aiΓembled an army of 500,000&nbsp;men, which he thought the moſt effectual method of&nbsp;ſecuring himſelf in his new dignity. In 1600 he concluded a peace with the Poles, but reſolved to continue&nbsp;the war againſt the Swedes ; however, being diſappoint-ed in ſome of his attempts againſt that nation, he entered into an a∏iance with the Swediſh monarch, and even&nbsp;propoſed a match between the king’s brother and his&nbsp;daughter. But while theſe things were in agitation,&nbsp;the city of Moſcow was defolated by one of the moſt&nbsp;dreadful famines recorded in hiſtory. Thouſands of&nbsp;people lay dead in the ſtreets and highways, with their&nbsp;mouths full of hay, ſtraw, or even the moſt filthy things&nbsp;which they had been attempting to eat. In many houſes&nbsp;the fatteſt perfon was killed in order to ſerve for food&nbsp;to the reſt. Parents were ſaid to have eaten their children, and children their parents, or to have fold them to&nbsp;buy bread. One author (Petrius) ſays, that he himſeli&nbsp;ſaw a woman bite ſeveral pieces out of a child’s arm as&nbsp;ſhe was carrying it along; and captain Margaret relates,&nbsp;that four women having ordered </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> peaſant to come to&nbsp;one of their houſes, under pretence of paying him for&nbsp;ſome wood, killed and eat up both him and his horſe.&nbsp;This dreadful calamity laſted three years, notwithſtand-ing all the means which Boris could uſe to alleviate it ;&nbsp;and in this time upwards of 500,000 people periſhed ia&nbsp;the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1604 a young man appeared, who pretended </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">be Demetrius, whom Boris had cauſed to ſhe murdered,&nbsp;as we have already ſeen. Being ſupported by the Poles,&nbsp;he .proved very troubleſome to Boris all his lifetime ;&nbsp;and after his death deprived Theodore Boriflbvitz, the&nbsp;new Czar, of the empire ; after which he aſcended the&nbsp;throne himſelf, and married a Poliſh princeſs. However, he held the empire but a iħort time, being killed&nbsp;in an inſurrection of his ſubjectsj and the unhappy Czarina was ſent priſoner to Jaroflaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the death of Demetrius, Ztrflti, who had conſpired againſt him, was choſen Czar; but rebellions continually taking place, and the empire being perpetually haraffed by the Poles and Swedes, in 1610 Zuſki was&nbsp;depoſed, and Uladi∏aus ſon of Sigiſmund king of Poland was elected. However, the Poles repreſenting to&nbsp;Sigiſmund, that it would be more glorious for him to&nbsp;be the conqueror of Ruſſia, than only the father of its&nbsp;ſovereign, he carried on the war with ſuch fury, that&nbsp;the Ruffians-in deſpair fell upon the Poles, who refided&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1">great numbers at Moſcow.
