<p><span class="font3">A colony, mainly of ChaIcidians, partIy of Messenians from the Peloponnesus, settled at Rcgium in the 8th century b.c. About&nbsp;494 b.c. Anaxilas, a member of the Messenian party, made himself master of Regium (apparently—from numismatic evidence,&nbsp;for the coins assignable to this period are modelled on Samian&nbsp;types—with the help of the Samians: see Messina) and about&nbsp;488 joined with them in occupying ZancIe (Messina). Here&nbsp;they remained. (See C. H. Dodd in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Hellenic Stttdies,<sub>&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font3"> xxviii. (1908) 56 sqq.) This coinage was resumed after the&nbsp;establishment of the democracy about 461 B.c., when Anaxilas<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>sons were driven out. In 433 Regium made a treaty with&nbsp;Athens, and in 427 joined the Athenians against Syracuse, but&nbsp;in 415 it remained neutral. An attack which it made on&nbsp;Dionysius I. of Syracuse in 399 was the beginning of a great&nbsp;struggle which in 387 resulted in its complete destruction and the&nbsp;dispersion of its inhabitants as slaves. Restored by the younger&nbsp;Dionysius under the name of Phoebias, the colony soon recovered&nbsp;its prosperity and resumed its original designation. In 280,&nbsp;when Pyrrhus invaded Italy, the Regines admitted within their&nbsp;walls a Roman garrison of Campanian troops; these mercenaries&nbsp;revolted, massacred the male citizens, and held the city till in&nbsp;270 they were besieged and put to death by the Roman consul&nbsp;Genucius. The city remained faithful to Rome throughout the&nbsp;Punic wars, and Hannibal never succeeded in taking it. Up&nbsp;till the Social War it struck coins of its own, with Greeklegends.&nbsp;Though one of the cities promised by the triumvirs to the&nbsp;veterans, Regium escaped through the favour of Octavius&nbsp;(hence it took the name Regium Julium). It continued,&nbsp;however, to be a Greek city even under the Empire, and never&nbsp;became a colony. Towards the end of the Empire it was made&nbsp;the chief city of the Bruttii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of ancient buildings hardly anything remains </span><span class="font0">at </span><span class="font2">Regium, and nothing of the archaic Greek.period is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in Situ,</span><span class="font2"> except possibly the&nbsp;remains of a temple of Artemis Phacelitis, which have not yet been&nbsp;explored, though various inscriptions relative to it have been found.&nbsp;The museum, however, contains a number of terra-cottas, vases,&nbsp;inscriptions, &amp;c., and a number </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">Byzantine lead seals. Several&nbsp;baths of the Greek period, modified by the Romans, have been&nbsp;found, and the remains of one of these may still be seen. A large&nbsp;mosaic of the 3rd or 4th century a.d. with representations of wild&nbsp;animals and the figure of a warrior in the centre was found in 1904&nbsp;and covered up again. The aqueduct and various cisterns connected&nbsp;with it have been traced, and some tombs of the 5th or 4th century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">B.c. </span><span class="font2">(or even later) were found in 1907.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REGIUM DONUM, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Gift, an annual grant formerly made from the public funds to Presbyterian and other Nonconformist ministers in Great Britain and Ireland. It dates&nbsp;from the reign of Charles II., who, according to Bishop Burnet,&nbsp;after the declaration of indulgence of 1672 ordered sums of&nbsp;money to be paid to Presbyterian ministers. These gifts or&nbsp;pensions were soon discontinued, but in 1690 William III. made&nbsp;a grant of £1200 a year to the Presbyterian ministers in Ireland&nbsp;as a reward for their services during his struggle with James II.&nbsp;Owing to the opposition of the Irish House of Lords the money&nbsp;was not paid in 1711 and some subsequent years, but it was&nbsp;revived in 1715 by George I., who increased the amount to&nbsp;£2000 a year. </span><span class="font3"><sup>-</sup> Further additions were made in 1784 and in&nbsp;1792, and in 1868 the sum granted to the Irish Presbyterian&nbsp;ministers was £45,000. The Regium Donum was withdrawn&nbsp;by the act of 1869 which disestablished the Irish church. Provision was made, however, for existing interests therein, and&nbsp;many Presbyterian ministers commuted these on the same&nbsp;terms as the clergy of the church of Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In England the Regium Donum proper dates from 1721, when Dr Edmund Calamy (1671-1732) received £500 from the royal&nbsp;bounty “ for the use and behaIf of the poor widows of dissenting&nbsp;ministers.” Afterwards this sum was increased to £1000 and&nbsp;was made an annual payment “ for the assisting either ministers&nbsp;or their widows,” and later it amounted to £1695 per annum.&nbsp;It was given to distributors who represented the three denominations, Presbyterians, Baptists and Independents, enjoying the&nbsp;grant. Among the Nonconformists themselves, however, or&nbsp;at least among the Baptists and the Independents, there was&nbsp;some objection to this form of state aid, and in 1851 the chancellor&nbsp;of the exchequer announced that it would be withdrawn. This&nbsp;was done six years later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REGLA, formerly an important suburb of Havana, Cuba, opposite that city, on the bay; now a part of Havana. Pop.&nbsp;(1899) 11,363. It was formerly the scene of the Havana bullfights. The church is onç of the best in Cuba; the building&nbsp;dates substantially from 1805, but the church settlement goes&nbsp;back to a hermitage established in 1690. RegIa is the shipping-point of the Havana sugar trade. It has enormous sugar and&nbsp;tobacco warehouses, fine wharves, a dry dock, foundries and an&nbsp;electric railway plant. It is the western terminus of the eastern&nbsp;line of the United Railways of Havana, and is connected with&nbsp;the main city of Havana by ferry. A fishing village was established here about 1733. At the end of the 18th century Regla&nbsp;was a principal centre of the smuggling trade, and about 1820&nbsp;was notorious as a resort of pirates. It first secured an&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ayunlamiento</span><span class="font3"> (city council) in 1872, and after 1899 was annexed&nbsp;to Havana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REGNARD, JEAN FRANÇOIS (1655-1709), French comic dramatist, was born in Paris on the 7th of February 1655. His&nbsp;father, a rich shopkeeper, died when Regnard was about&nbsp;twenty, leaving him master of a considerable Iortune. He set&nbsp;off at once for ItaIy, and, after a series of romantic adventures,&nbsp;he journeyed by Holland, Denmark and Sweden to Lapland,&nbsp;and thence by Poland, Turkey, Hungary and Germany back to&nbsp;France. HereturnedtoParisatthe end of 1683, and bought&nbsp;the place of treasurer of France in the Paris district; he had a&nbsp;house at Paris in the Rue Richelieu; and he acquired the&nbsp;small estate of Grillon near Dourdan in the department of&nbsp;Seine-et-Oise, where he hunted, feasted and wrote comedies.&nbsp;This latter amusement he began in 1688 with a piece called&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Divorce,</span><span class="font3"> which was performed at the Théâtre Italien. In four&nbsp;slight pieces of the same nature be collaborated with Charles&nbsp;Riviere Dufresny. He gained access to the Théâtre Français&nbsp;on the 19th of May 1694 with a piece called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Attendez-moi sous&nbsp;Forme<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font3">  and two years later, on the 19th of December 1696, he&nbsp;produced there the masterly comedy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Joueur,</span><span class="font3"> The idea of&nbsp;the play was evolved in collaboration with Dufresny, but the&nbsp;authors disagreed in carrying it out. Finally they each produced&nbsp;a comedy on the subject, Dufresny in prose, and Regnard in&nbsp;verse. Each accused the other of plagiarism. The plot of&nbsp;Regnard’s piece turns on the love of two sisters for Valère, the&nbsp;gambler, who loves one and pretends to love the other, really&nbsp;deceiving them both, because there is no room for any other&nbsp;passion in his character except the love of play. Other of his&nbsp;plays were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">La Sérénade</span><span class="font3"> (1694), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Bourgeois de Falaise</span><span class="font3"> (1696),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Distrait</span><span class="font3"> (1697), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dêmacrite</span><span class="font3"> (1700), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Retour imprévu</span><span class="font3"> (1700),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Les Folies amoureuses</span><span class="font3"> (1704), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Les Ménechmes</span><span class="font3"> (1705), a clever&nbsp;following of Plautus, and his masterpiece, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Légataire universel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1708).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regnard’s death on the 4th of September 1709 renews the doubtful and romantic circumstances of his earlier life. Some&nbsp;hint at poison, but the truth seems to be that his death W’as&nbsp;hastened by the rate at which he lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides the plays noticed above and others, Regnard wrote miscellaneous poems, the autobiographical romance of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Provençale,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and several short accounts in prose of his travels, published posthumously under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages,</span><span class="font2"> Regnard had written a reply&nbsp;to the tenth satire of Boileau, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Contre les femmes,</span><span class="font2"> and Boileau had&nbsp;retorted by putting Regnard among the poets depreciated in his&nbsp;epistle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sur mes vers.</span><span class="font2"> After the appearance of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Joueur</span><span class="font2"> the poet&nbsp;altered his opinion and cut out the allusion. The saying attributed&nbsp;to Boileau when some one, thinking to curry favour, remarked that&nbsp;Regnard was only a mediocre poet, “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Il n'est pas médiocrement gai”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">is both true and very appropriate. His French style, especially in&nbsp;his purely prose works, is not considered faultless. He is often, unoriginal in his plots, and, whether Dufresny was Orwasnotjustified&nbsp;in his complaint about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Joueur<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font2">  it seems likely that Regnard owed&nbsp;not a little to him and to others; but he had a thorough grasp of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
