<p><span class="font1">the work of Aristotle. On the other hand, the practical character is more strongly marked. It might, indeed, be&nbsp;said of Aristotle’s treatise that it is rather a Philosophy&nbsp;of Rhetoric than a Rhetoric proper. It is a body of&nbsp;abstract principles and general rules. These will enable&nbsp;the student to dissect a good speech ; but, by themselves,&nbsp;they will not go far towards enabling him to make one.&nbsp;Aristotle’s purpose was to annex rhetoric to the realm of&nbsp;science. He succeeded, as far as success was possible.&nbsp;But the new province was somewhat of a Poland. The&nbsp;rigid system which was found necessary for holding the&nbsp;unruly dependency did not leave much scope for spontaneous vigour or native exuberance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the three centuries from the age of Alexander to that of Augustus the fortunes of rhetoric were governed&nbsp;by the new conditions of Hellenism. Aristotle’s scientific&nbsp;method lived on in the Peripatetic school. Meanwhile, however, the fashion of florid declamation or strained conceits&nbsp;prevailed in the rhetorical schools of Asia, where, amid&nbsp;mixed populations, the pure traditions of the best Greek&nbsp;taste had been dissociated from the use of the Greek language. The “ Asianism ” of style which thus came to be&nbsp;contrasted with “ Atticism ” found imitators at Rome,&nbsp;among whom must be reckoned the orator Hortensius (c.&nbsp;95 b.c.). Hermagoras of Temnos in Æolis (c. 110 b.c.)&nbsp;claims mention as having done much to revive a higher conception. Using both the practical rhetoric of the time before&nbsp;Aristotle and Aristotle’s philosophical rhetoric, he worked&nbsp;up the results of both in a new system,—following the&nbsp;philosophers so far as to give the chief prominence to&nbsp;“invention.” He thus became the founder of a rhetoric&nbsp;which, as distinguished from the practical and the philosophical, may be called the scholastic. Through the&nbsp;influence of his school, Hermagoras did for Roman eloquence very much what the school of Isocrates had done for&nbsp;Athens. Above all, he counteracted the view of “Asianism,” that oratory is a mere knack founded on practice,&nbsp;and recalled attention to the study of it as an art.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cicero’s rhetorical works are to some extent based on the technical system to which he had been introduced by&nbsp;Molon at Rhodes, and by other contemporary teachers.&nbsp;But Cicero further made an independent use of the best&nbsp;among the earlier Greek writers, as Isocrates, Aristotle, and&nbsp;Theophrastus. Lastly, he could draw, at least in the later&nbsp;of his treatises, on a vast fund of reflection and experience.&nbsp;Indeed, the distinctive interest of his contributions to the&nbsp;theory of rhetoric consists in the fact that his theory can&nbsp;be compared with his practice. The result of such a comparison is certainly to suggest how much less he owed to&nbsp;his art than to his genius. Some consciousness of this is&nbsp;perhaps implied in the idea which pervades much of his&nbsp;writing on oratory, that the perfect orator is the perfect&nbsp;man. The same thought is present to Quintilian, in whose&nbsp;great work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Institutions Oratoria,</span><span class="font1"> the scholastic&nbsp;rhetoric receives its most complete expression (c. 90 a.d.).&nbsp;Quintilian treats oratory as the end to which the entire&nbsp;mental and moral development of the student is to be&nbsp;directed. Thus he devotes his first book to an early&nbsp;discipline which should precede the orator’s first studies,&nbsp;and his last book to a discipline of the whole man which&nbsp;lies beyond them. Some notion of his comprehensive&nbsp;method may be derived from the circumstance that,&nbsp;in connexion with precepts for storing the speaker’s&nbsp;mind, he introduces a succinct estimate of the chief&nbsp;Greek and Roman authors, of every kind, from Homer&nbsp;to Seneca (bk. x. §§ 46-131). After Quintilian, the next&nbsp;name which deserves to be signalized in the history of&nbsp;the art is that of Hermogenes, who about 170 a.d.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font1">made a complete digest of the scholastic rhetoric from the time of Hermagoras of Temnos (110 B.c.). It is&nbsp;contained in five extant treatises, which are remarkable&nbsp;for clearness and acuteness, and still more remarkable as&nbsp;having been completed before the age of twenty-five.&nbsp;Hermogenes continued for nearly a century and a half to&nbsp;be one of the chief authorities in the schools. Longinus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 260 A.D.) published an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Art of Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> which is still&nbsp;extant; and the more celebrated treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">On Sublimity&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(7τept υ∣∕&lt;oυς), if not his work, is at least of the same period.&nbsp;About 315 A.D. Aphthonius composed the “exercises”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{πpoyvpvaσpaτd)</span><span class="font1"> which superseded thework of Hermogenes.&nbsp;At the revival of letters the treatise of Aphthonius once&nbsp;more became a standard text-book. Much popularity was&nbsp;enjoyed also by the exercises of Ælius Theon (380 a.d.).&nbsp;Space would fail if we attempted to enumerate the writers&nbsp;on rhetoric who, during these centuries, attained to more&nbsp;or less repute. In the editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetores Græci</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;Spengel and by Walz the fecundity of the literature can&nbsp;be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theory of rhetoric engaged this industry, because the practice of the art was in greater vogue than ever before&nbsp;or since. During the first four centuries of the empire&nbsp;several causes contributed to this result. First, there was&nbsp;a general dearth of the higher intellectual interests ; politics&nbsp;gave no scope to energy ; philosophy was stagnant, and&nbsp;literature, as a rule, either arid or frivolous. Then the&nbsp;Greek schools had poured their rhetoricians into Rome,&nbsp;where the same tastes which revelled in coarse luxury&nbsp;welcomed tawdry declamation. The law-courts of the&nbsp;Roman provinces further created a continual demand for&nbsp;forensic speaking. Asia, Gaul, and Africa are now the&nbsp;regions which supply the largest proportion of successful&nbsp;orators. The passion for rhetoric was everywhere. “ Thule&nbsp;talks of engaging an orator,” says Juvenal. “You call&nbsp;a man a thief,” says Persius; “he answers you with&nbsp;finished tropes.” Athens, Smyrna, Rhodes, Tarsus,&nbsp;Antioch, Alexandria, Massilia, and many other cities had&nbsp;seats of learning at which rhetoric was taught by professors who enjoyed the highest consideration. The public&nbsp;teacher of rhetoric was called “sophist,” which was now&nbsp;an academic title, similar to “professor” or “doctor.”&nbsp;In the 4th century B.c. Isocrates had taken pride in&nbsp;the name of σo&lt;∕&gt;ισττ)ς, which, indeed, had at no time&nbsp;wholly lost the good, or neutral, sense which originally&nbsp;belonged to it. The academic meaning which it acquired&nbsp;under the early empire lasted into the AIiddle Ages (see&nbsp;Ducange, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s.v.,</span><span class="font1"> who quotes from Baldricus, “Egregius&nbsp;Doctor magnusque Sophista Geraldus ”). While the&nbsp;word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhetor</span><span class="font1"> still denoted the -faculty, the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sophistes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">denoted the office or rank to which the rhetor might hope&nbsp;to rise. So in Lucian’s piece (160 a.d.), the “ Teacher of&nbsp;Rhetoricians” says (§ 1),—“You ask, young man, how&nbsp;you are to become a rhetor, and attain in your turn&nbsp;to the repute of that most impressive and illustrious title,&nbsp;sophist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vespasian (70-79 a.d.), according to Suetonius, was the first emperor who gave a public endowment to the teaching of rhetoric. But it was under Hadrian and the&nbsp;Antonines (117-180 a.d.) that the public chairs of&nbsp;rhetoric were raised to an importance which made them&nbsp;objects of the highest ambition. The complete constitution of the schools at Athens was due to Marcus Aurelius.&nbsp;The Philosophical School had four chairs (0po<sup>,</sup>vot),—Platonic,&nbsp;Stoic, Peripatetic, Epicurean. The Rhetorical School had&nbsp;two chairs, one for “sophistic,” the other for “political'’&nbsp;rhetoric. By “sophistic” was meant the academic teaching of rhetoric as an art, in distinction from its “ political ” application to the law-courts. The “ sophistical ”&nbsp;chair was superior to the “ political ” in dignity as in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
