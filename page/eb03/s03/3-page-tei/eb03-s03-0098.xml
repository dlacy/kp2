The ſtations were fortified with deep ditches and ſtrong walls, the wall itſelf coinciding with and forming the north wall of each ſtation. Within the ſtations were lodgings for the officers and ſoldiers in garriſon ; the ſmalleſt of them being ſufficient to contain a cohort, or 600 men. Without the walls of each ſtation was a town, inhabited by labourers, artificers, and others, both Romans and Britons, who choſe to dwell under the protection of theſe fortreſſes. The number of the ſtations upon the wall was exactly 18 ; and if they had been placed at equal diſtances, the interval between every two of them would have been four miles and a few paces : but the intervention of rivers, marſhes, and mountains ; the conveniency of ſituations for ſtrength, proſpect, and water ; and many other circumſtances to us unknown, determined them to place theſe ſtations at unequal diſtances. The ſituation which was always choſen by the Romans, both here and everywhere else in Britain where they could obtain it, was the gentle declivity of a hill, near a river, and facing the meridian sun. Such was the ſituation of the far greateſt part of the ſtations on this wall. In general, we may obſerve, that the ſtations stood thickeſt near the two ends and in the middle, probably becauſe the danger of invaſion was greateſt in theſe places. But the reader will form a clearer idea of the number of theſe ſtations, their Latin and Engliſh names, their ſituation and diſtance from one another, by inſpecting the following table, than we can give him with equal brevity in any other way. The firſt column contains the number of the ſtation, reckoning from eaſt to west ; the ſecond contains its Latin, and the third its Engliſh name ; and the three laſt its diſtance from the next ſtation to the west of it, in miles, furlongs, and chains.</p><table><row><cell>N⁰</cell><cell>Latin Name.</cell><cell>Engliſh Name.</cell><cell>M</cell><cell>F.</cell><cell>C.</cell></row><row><cell>I</cell><cell>Segedunum</cell><cell>Couſins’-houſe</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>1 </cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>Pons Ælii</cell><cell>Newcaſtle</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>Condercum</cell><cell>Benwell hill</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>Vindobala</cell><cell>Rutcheſter</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3 ½</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>Hunnum</cell><cell>Halton-cheſters</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>I</cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>Cilurnum</cell><cell>Walwick-cheſters</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>7</cell><cell>Procolitia</cell><cell>Carrawbrugh</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3 ½</cell></row><row><cell>8</cell><cell>Borcovicus</cell><cell>Houſeſteeds</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>9</cell><cell>Vindolana</cell><cell>Little-cheſters</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>10</cell><cell>Æsica</cell><cell>Grcat-cheſters</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>I</cell><cell>6 ½</cell></row><row><cell>I I</cell><cell>Magna</cell><cell>Carrvoran</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>12</cell><cell>Amboglanna</cell><cell>Burdoswald</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>13</cell><cell>Petriana</cell><cell>Cambeck</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>6</cell></row><row><cell>14</cell><cell>Aballaba</cell><cell>Watchcroſs</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>I</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>15</cell><cell>Congavata</cell><cell>Stanwix</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>16</cell><cell>Axelodunum</cell><cell>Brugh</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell><hi rend="superscript">1</hi>7</cell><cell>Gabroſentum</cell><cell>Brumbrugh</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>I</cell></row><row><cell>18</cell><cell>Tunnocelum</cell><cell>Boulneſs</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell> </cell><cell>i</cell><cell>Length of the wall</cell><cell>68</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>3</cell></row></table><p>The <hi rend="italic">castella,</hi> or caſtles, were the ſecond kind of fortifications which were built along the line of this wall for its defence. Theſe caſtles were neither ſo large nor ſtrong as the ſtations, but much more numerous, being no fewer than 81. The ſhape and dimenſions of the caſtles, as appears from the foundations of many</p><p>of them which are still viſible, were exact ſquares of 66 feet every way. They were fortified on every side with thick and lofty walls, but without any ditch, except on the north side ; on which the wall itſelf, raiſed much above its uſual height, with the ditch attending it, formed the fortification. The caſtles were ſituated in the intervals between the ſtations, at the diſtance of about ſeven furlongs from each other ; though particular circumſtances ſometimes occaſioned a little variation. In theſe caſtles, guards were conſtantly kept by a competent number of men detached from the neareſt ſtations.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">turres,</hi> or turrets, were the third and laſt kind of fortifications on the wall. Theſe were ſtill much ſmaller than the caſtles, and formed only a ſquare of about 12 feet, ſtanding out of the wall on its ſouth side. Being ſo ſmall, they are more entirely ruined than the ſtations and caſtles, which makes it difficult to diſcover their exact number. They ſtood in the intervals between the caſtles ; and from the faint veſtiges of a few of them, it is conjectured that there were four of them between every two caſtles, at the diſtance of about 300 yards from one another. According to this conjecture, the number of the turrets amounted to 324. They were deſigned for watch-towers and places for ſentinels, who, being within hearing of one another, could convey an alarm or piece of intelligence to all parts of the wall in a very little time.</p><p>Such were the ſtations, caſtles, and turrets, on the wall of Severus ; and a very conſiderable body of troops was conſtantly quartered in them for its defence. The uſual complement allowed for this ſervice was as follows :</p><p>1.	Twelve cohorts of foot, confiding of <hi rend="smallcaps">600 </hi>men each: 7,200</p><p>2.	One cohort of mariners in the ſtation at Boulneſs: 600</p><p>3.	One detachment of Moors, probably equal to a cohort: 600</p><p>4.	Four alae or wings of horſe, confiding, at the loweſt computation, of 400 each: 1,600</p><p>10,000</p><p>For the conveniency of marching theſe troops from one part of the wall to another, with the greater eaſe and expedition, on any ſervice, it was attended with  two military ways, paved with ſquare ſtones, in the moſt ſolid and beautiful manner. One of theſe ways was ſmaller, and the other larger. The ſmaller military way run cloſe along the ſouth side of the wall, from turret to turret, and caſtle to caſtle, for the uſe of the ſoldiers in relieving their guards and centinels, and ſuch ſervices. The larger way did not keep ſo near the wall, nor touch at the turrets or caſtles, but purſued the moſt direct courſe from one ſtation to another, and was deſigned for the conveniency of marching larger bodies of troops.</p><p>It is to be regretted, that we cannot gratify the reader’s curiosity, by informing him by what particular bodies of Roman troops the ſeveral parts of this great work were executed ; as we were enabled to do with regard to the wall of Antoninus Pius from inſcriptions. For though it is probable that there were</p></body></text></TEI>
