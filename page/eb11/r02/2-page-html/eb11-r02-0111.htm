<p><span class="font0">which is open behind; through it extends horizontally the columellar rod, received with its outer portion by a notch on the&nbsp;posterior side of the quadrate. This is of very complicated&nbsp;shape. Its outer margins form most of the tympanic frame;&nbsp;the posterior margins being curved backwards leave a wide notch&nbsp;behind in the Cryptodira and in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font0"> but in the Pleurodira&nbsp;this part of the quadrate is transformed into a trumpet, the rim&nbsp;of which, forming a complete ring, carries thc tympanic membrane. The tympanic cavity thus formed often leads into a&nbsp;deep recess which extends into the hollowed-out squamosal&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo)</span><span class="font0"> towards the opisthotic and bears some resemblance to the intricate tympanic recesses which pervade that&nbsp;region of the crocodile’s skull. With its upper anterior and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">inner portion the quadrate joins the large proötic bone which is usually completely fused with the rest of the opisthotic, but in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font0"> it remains separate, and in this turtle the sutures&nbsp;between the otic bones and the Supraoccipital also persist. In&nbsp;front of the prootics the bony lateral walls of the brain-case end&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font0"> but· in most of the other Chelonians bony alisphenoids are represented by a pair of epipterygoids which rest&nbsp;upon short upward processes of the pterygoids and are joined by&nbsp;much longer, rather thin, but broad descending lamellae from</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the parietals. They represent of course the columcllae cranii or Pterygoidal columcllae; if they are of alisphenoidal origin thc&nbsp;term epipterygoids is a misnomer; the same applies&nbsp;to these structures in other reptiles. Through the&nbsp;space enclosed by thc pterygoid, basioccipital,&nbsp;opisthotic and quadrate, enters thc cranial carotid&nbsp;artery, sometimes piercing thc posterior rim of the&nbsp;pterygoid; then thc canal runs along thc dorsal side&nbsp;of this bone and opens near thc cranial columella.&nbsp;Thc arcades over thc temporal region arc most variable. Potentially Chelonians possess all the three&nbsp;arcades of the crocodiles, but it so happens that&nbsp;never more than one fenestra is present. The&nbsp;false roof over thc temporal region is most complete&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font0"> and in thc </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonidae.</span><span class="font0"> Excepting&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis the</span><span class="font0"> Supraoccipital extends far beyond thc&nbsp;back of the cranium in shape of a long unpaired&nbsp;crest, which never diverges, or sends out lateral&nbsp;processes, but it is joined, and partly overlaid for a&nbsp;great part of its length, by the parietals in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonidae&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis.</span><span class="font0"> In these genera the much-enlarged&nbsp;parietal, the equally large postfrontal, with the&nbsp;squamosal behind, the jugal below, and a large&nbsp;quadrato-jugal, form one continuous bony roof over&nbsp;the whole temporal fossa, which is widely open&nbsp;behind, the space being bordered by Supraoccipital,&nbsp;opisthotic, squamosal and parietal. All other&nbsp;Chclonians show a great reduction of this roof.&nbsp;Thc parietal does not send out dorsolateral expansions; and the postfrontal likewise forms no expansions. It joins the rather short malar, forming&nbsp;the posteriororbital bridge, which posteriorly is&nbsp;connected by the quadrato-jugal with the upper&nbsp;portion of the quadrate and with thc squamosal. The latter&nbsp;rests upon the quadrate and is in no connexion with the parietal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consequently the whole temporal fossa is quite open. The horizontal bridge or arcade is to a certain extent homologous with the infra-temporal arcade. All the bones which border the temporal&nbsp;fossa vary much in extent.
