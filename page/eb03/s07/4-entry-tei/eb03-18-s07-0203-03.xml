a county of England, deriving its name from its ſituation in reſpect of the other Saxons, and called <hi rend="italic">Sussex, i. e.</hi> the country of the South Saxons, has Hampſhire on the west, the Britiſh channel on the south, Surry on the north, and Kent on the eaſt. Its length is 65 miles, its breadth 30, and its circumference 170. It is divided into 6 rapes, and theſe into 65 hundreds, in which are 342 pariſhes, of which 123 are vicarages, one city, 16 market-towns, 1,140,000 acres, and about 120,000 souls. It has few good ports, though it lies along the channel for 65 miles, which is its greateſt length, the coaſt being encumbered in many places with rocks ; and where it is more open, ſuch quantities of sand are thrown upon it by the ſouth-weſt winds, and the harbours ſo choaked up, that they will not admit vessels of any great draught or burden. The county is well watered by the rivers Arun, Adar, Ouſe, Rother, Lavant, Cuckmeer, Aſhburn, and Aften, by which it is well supplied with fiſh, as well as from the ſea. Hence different places of the county are famed for different sorts of fiſh, as the Arun for mullets, which enter it from the ſea in ſummer in shoals, and by feeding upon a particular kind of herb become extremely delicious : Chi- cheſter for lobſters, Selſey for cockles, Amberley for trout, Pulborough for eels, Rye for herrings, and the county in<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0210.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0204"/>
general for carp. It is remarkable, that all the rivers above-mentioned riſe and fall into the ſea within the county.</p><p>The air, as well as the soil, is various in different parts of the county. Upon the coaſt the air is aguiſh, upon the hills and downs pleaſant and wholeſome ; but ſomewhat moiſt and foggy in the valleys, the soil being deep and rich, and the vegetation in ſummer very vigorous. The downs in ſome places are very fertile in corn and graſs ; in others they feed great flocks of sheep, whoſe fleſh and wool are very fine ; but of the latter no inconſiderable quantity is clandeſtinely exported to France. In the Weald and the valleys the roads are very deep, eſpecially in winter. In the north quarter are many woods, and ſome foreſts in other places ; whence the king’s yards are ſupplied with the largeſt and beſt timber in England, beſide what is made into charcoal and confirmed in the iron-works ; for on the eaſt side is plenty of iron ore, with furnaces, forges, and mills for manufacturing it. The gunpowder of this county is ſaid to excel that of any other. Thoſe delicious birds called w <hi rend="italic">heat- ears</hi> are bred in this ſhire ; they are no bigger than a lark, but almoſt an entire lump of fat. That part now called the <hi rend="italic">Wild</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Weald</hi> of Suffex, was anciently a mere deſert for hogs and deer, of great extent, taking in a part of Kent and Surry ; and was called <hi rend="italic">Anderidα Silva, Coid Andred,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Andradſwald,</hi> from Anderida an adjoining city. This county is in the home-circuit and diocese of Chicheſter, giving title of earl to the family of Yelverton, and sends 28 members to parliament, viz, two for the county, two for the city of Chicheſter, and two for each of the following towns, Horſham, Lewes, Bramber, Eaſt-Grinſtead, Midhurſt, Shoreham, Staining, Arundel, Haſtings, Rye, Winchelſea, and Seaford ; of which the four laſt are cinqueports.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
