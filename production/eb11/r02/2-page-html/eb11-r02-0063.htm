<p><span class="font1">RENNIB<sub>t</sub>JOHN (1761-1821), British engineer, was the youngest son of James Rennie, a farmer at Phantassie, Haddingtonshire,&nbsp;where he was born on the 7th of June 1761. On his way to&nbsp;the parish school at East Linton he used to pass the workshop&nbsp;of Andrew Meikle (1719-1800), the inventor of the threshing&nbsp;machine, and its attractions were such that he spent there much&nbsp;of the time that was supposed to be spent at school. In his&nbsp;twelfth year he was placed under MeikIe, but after two years he&nbsp;was sent to Dunbar High SchooI, where he showed marked&nbsp;aptitude for mathematics. On his return to Phantassie he&nbsp;occasionally assisted Meikle, and soon began to erect corn mills&nbsp;on his own account. In 1780, while continuing his millwright’s&nbsp;business, he began to attend the classes on physical science at&nbsp;Edinburgh University. Four years later he was commissioned&nbsp;by Boulton and Watt, to whom he was introduced by Professor&nbsp;John Robison (1739-1805), his teacher at Edinburgh, to superintend the construction of the machinery for the Albion flour&nbsp;mills, which they were building at the south end of Blackfriars&nbsp;Bridge, London, and a feature of his work there was the use of&nbsp;iron for many portions of the machines which had formerly been&nbsp;made of wood. The completion of these mills established his&nbsp;reputation as a mechanical engineer, and soon secured him a&nbsp;large business as a maker of millwork of all descriptions. But&nbsp;his fame chiefly rests on his achievements in civil engineering.&nbsp;As a canal engineer his services began to be in request about&nbsp;1790, and the Avon and Kennet, the Rochdale and the Lancaster&nbsp;canals may be mentioned among his numerous works in England.&nbsp;His skill solved the problem of draining and*reclaiming extensive&nbsp;tracts of marsh in the eastern counties and on the SoIway Firth.&nbsp;As a bridge engineer he was responsible for many structures in&nbsp;England and Scotland, among the most conspicuous being three&nbsp;over the Thames—Waterloo Bridge, Southwark Bridge and&nbsp;London Bridge—the last of which he did not five to see completed. A noteworthy feature in many of his designs was the&nbsp;flat roadway. Among the harbours and docks in the construction&nbsp;of which he was concerned may be mentioned those at Wick,&nbsp;Torquay, Grimsby, Holyhead, Howth, Kingstown and Hull,&nbsp;together with the London dock and the East India dock on the&nbsp;Thames, and he was consulted by the government in respect of&nbsp;improvements at the dockyards of Portsmouth, Sheerness,&nbsp;Chatham and Plymouth, where the breakwater was built from&nbsp;his plans. He died in London on the 4th of October 1821, and&nbsp;was buried in St Paul’s. In person he was of great stature and&nbsp;strength, and a bust of him by Chantrey (now in the National&nbsp;Gallery), when exhibited at Somerset House, obtained the name&nbsp;of Jupiter Tonans. Of his family, the eldest son George, who was&nbsp;born in London on the 3rd of September 1791 and died there&nbsp;on the 30th of March 1866, carried on his father’s business in&nbsp;partnership with the second son John, who was born in London&nbsp;on the 30th of August 1794 and died near Hêrtford on the 3rd&nbsp;of September 1874. George devoted himself especially to the&nbsp;mechanical side of the business. John completed the construction of London Bridge, and at its opening in 1831 was made&nbsp;a knight. He succeeded his father as engineer to the Admiralty,&nbsp;and finished the Plymouth breakwater, of which he published&nbsp;an account in 1848. He was also the author of a book on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theory, Formation and Construction of British and Foreign&nbsp;Harbours</span><span class="font1"> (1851-54), and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span><span class="font1"> appeared in 1875.&nbsp;He was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers&nbsp;in 1845, and held the office for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENO, a city and the county-seat of Washoe county, Nevada,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">U.S.A., in the W. part of the state, on the Truckee river, and about 244 m. E. of San Francisco. Pop. (1890) 3563; (1900)&nbsp;4500 (915 foreign-bom); (1910 census) 10,867. It is served by&nbsp;the Southern Pacific, the Virginia &amp; Truckee and the Nevada-California-Oregon railways. The city lies near the foot of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sierra Nevada Mountains, 4484 ft. above the sea, and is in the most humid district of a state which has little rainfall. Among&nbsp;the public institutions are the university of Nevada (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nevada),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a United States Agricultural Experiment Station, a public library&nbsp;(1903), the Nevada Hospital for MentaI Diseases (1882), the City&nbsp;and County Hospital and the People’s Hospital. At Reno are&nbsp;railway shops (of the Nevada-California-Oregon railway) and reduction works, and the manufactures include flour, foundry and&nbsp;machine-shop products, lumber, beer, plaster and packed meats.&nbsp;Farming and stock-raising are carried on extensively in the&nbsp;vicinity. On the site of the present city a road house was&nbsp;erected in 1859 for the accommodation of travellers and freight&nbsp;teams on their way to and from California. By 1863 this place&nbsp;had become known as Lake’s Crossing, and five years later it was&nbsp;chosen as a site for a station by the Central (now thg Southern)&nbsp;Pacific railway, then building through the Truckee Valley.&nbsp;The new station was then named Reno, in honour of Gen. Jesse&nbsp;Lee Reno (1823-1862), a Federal officer during the Civil War,&nbsp;who was commissioned brigadier-general of volunteers in&nbsp;November 1861 and major-general of volunteers in July 1862,'&nbsp;and led the Ninth Corps at South Mountain, where he was killed.&nbsp;The city twice suffered from destructive fires, in 1873 and 1879.&nbsp;Reno was incorporated as a town in 1879 and chartered as a city&nbsp;in 1899. Its city charter was withdrawn in 1901, but it was&nbsp;rechartered in 1903.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENOIR, FIRMIN AUGUSTE (1841- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French painter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was born at Limoges in 1841. In his early work he followed, with pronounced modern modifications, certain traditions of&nbsp;the French 18th-century school,'more particularly of Boucher,*&nbsp;of whom we are reminded by the decorative tendency, the pink&nbsp;and ivory flesh tints and the facile technique of Renoir. In&nbsp;the ’seventies he threw himself into the impressionist movement&nbsp;and became one of its leaders. In some of his paintings he&nbsp;carried the new principle of the division of tones to its extreme;&nbsp;but in his best work, notably in some of his paintings of the&nbsp;nude, he retained much of the refined sense of beauty of colour&nbsp;of the 18th century. Renoir has tried his skill almost in every&nbsp;genre—in portraiture, landscape, flower-painting, scenes of modern&nbsp;life and figure subject; and though he is perhaps the most unequal of the great impressionists, his finest works rank among the&nbsp;masterpieces of thc modern French school. Among these are&nbsp;some of his nude “ Bathers,” the “ Rowers’ Luncheon,” the&nbsp;“ Ball at the Moulin de la Galette,” “ The Box,” “ The Terrace,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ La Pensée,”</span><span class="font1"> and the portrait of “ Jeanne Samary.” He is&nbsp;represented in the Caillebotte room at the Luxembourg, in the&nbsp;collection of M. Durand-Ruel, and in most of the collections of&nbsp;impressionist paintings in France and in the United States.&nbsp;Comparatively few of his works have come to England, but thé&nbsp;full range of his capacity was seen at the exhibition of impressionist art held at the Grafton Galleries in London in 1905.&nbsp;At the Viau sale in Paris in 1907, a- garden scene by Renoir,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ La Tonnellef<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font1">  realized 26,000 frs., and a UttIe head, “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ingénue,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">25,100 frs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENOUF, SIR PETER LE PAGE (1822-1897), Egyptologist, was born in Guernsey, on the 23rd of August 1822. He was&nbsp;educated at Elizabeth College there, and proceeded to Oxford,&nbsp;which, upon his becoming a Roman Catholic, under the influence&nbsp;of·Dr Newman, he quitted without taking a degree. Like many&nbsp;other AngUcan converts, he proved a thorn in the side of the&nbsp;Ultramontane party in the Roman Church, though he did not,&nbsp;like some of them, return to the communion of the Church of&nbsp;England. He opposed the promulgation of the dogma of Papal&nbsp;InfallibiUty, and his treatise (1868) upon the condemnation of&nbsp;Pope Honorius for heresy by the council of Constantinople in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 680 was placed upon the index of prohibited books.
