                were skilful architects, sculptors, and mosaicists.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The following are the names and dates known from existing
                inscriptions :—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Their principal works in Rome are :—ambones of S. Maria in Ara Cceli
                (Lorenzo) ; door of S. Saba, 1205, anti door with mosaics&nbsp;of S. Tommaso in
                Formis (Jacopo) ; chapel of the Sancta Sanctorum,&nbsp;by the Lateran (Cosimo) ;
                pavement of S. Jacopoalla Lungara, and&nbsp;(probably) the magnificent episcopal
                throne and choir-screen in S.&nbsp;Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, of 1254 (Jacopo the
                younger) ;@@<sup>2</sup> baldacchino&nbsp;of the Lateran and of S. Maria in
                Cosmedin, c. 1294 (Adeodato) ;&nbsp;tombs in S. Maria sopra Minerva (c. 1296), in S.
                Maria Maggiore,&nbsp;and in S. Balbina (Giovanni), A large number of other works
                by&nbsp;members and pupils of the same family, but unsigned, exist in&nbsp;Rome.
                These are mainly altars and baldacchini, choir-screens,&nbsp;paschal candlesticks,
                ambones, tombs, and the like, all enriched with&nbsp;sculpture and glass mosaic of
                great brilliance and decorative effect.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic patterns and
                architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures&nbsp;and sculpture of
                very high merit, especially the recumbent effigies,&nbsp;with angels standing at the
                head and foot, in the tombs of Ara&nbsp;Cceli, S. Maria Maggiore, anti elsewhere.
                One of their finest works&nbsp;is in S. Cesareo ; this is a marble altar richly
                decorateel with mosaic&nbsp;in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing
                back a curtain&nbsp;(all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the
                confessio.&nbsp;The magnificent cloisters of S. Paolo fuori Ie Mura, built
                about&nbsp;1285 by Giovanni, the youngest of the Cosmati, are one of the&nbsp;most
                beautiful works of this school. The baldacchino of the same&nbsp;basilica is a
                signed work of the Florentine Arnolfo del Cambio,&nbsp;1285, “cum suo socio Petro,”
                probably a pupil of the Cosmati.&nbsp;Other works of Arnolfo, such as the Braye tomb
                at Ohvieto (g<sup>,</sup>.v.),&nbsp;show an intimate artistic alliance between him
                and the Cosmati.&nbsp;The equally magnificent cloisters of the Lateran, of about the
                same&nbsp;date, are very similar in design ; both these triumphs of the
                sculptor-architect’s
                and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mosaicist’s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work
                have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slender
            marble&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;columns,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">twisted or straight, richly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inlaid
                with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bands of glass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mosaic

        <p><span class="font2">delicate and brilliant patterns. The shrine of the Confessor at
                AVestminster is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a work of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this
                school,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executed about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1268
                (see</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic). The
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general style of works&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the
                Cosmati&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school is</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Gothic in its main lines, especially in the elaborate altar-canopies,
                with their pierced geometrical tracery. In detail, however, they&nbsp;differ widely
                from the purer Gothic of northern countries. The&nbsp;richness of effect which the
                English or French architect obtained&nbsp;by elaborate and carefully worked
                mouldings was produced in Italy&nbsp;by the beauty of polished marbles and
                jewel-like mosaics,—the&nbsp;details being mostly rather coarse and often carelessly
                executed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Chiefly to the 13th century belong the large number of beautiful
                campanili, which are the most conspicuous relics of the mediæval&nbsp;period in
                Rome. The finest of these are attached to the churches&nbsp;of S. AIaria Nuova, SS.
                Giovanni e Paolo, and S. Maria Maggiore.&nbsp;Others belong to the basilicas of S.
                Lorenzo fuori and S. Croce in&nbsp;Gerusalemme, and to S. Giorgio in Velabro, S.
                Maria in Cosmedin,&nbsp;S. Alessio, S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, S. Cecilia, S.
                Crisogono,&nbsp;and S. Pudentiana. They occupy various positions with regard
                to&nbsp;the church, being all later additions ; that of SS. Giovanni e
                Paolo&nbsp;stands at some distance from it. In design they are very
                similar,&nbsp;consisting of many stages, divided by brick and marble cornices
                ;&nbsp;in the upper stories are from two to four windows on each side,&nbsp;with
                round arches supported on slender marble columns. They&nbsp;are decorated with
                brilliantly coloured </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >eiotole</span><span class="font2"> or disks of earthenware, enamelled and painted
                in green or turquoise blue, among the&nbsp;earliest existing specimens of the
                so-called majolica (see Pottery,&nbsp;vol. xix. p. 624 </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">sq.).</span><span class="font2"> Sometimes disks or
                crosses made of red or&nbsp;green porphyry are inlaid in the walls. In most cases on
                one face&nbsp;of the top story is a projecting canopied niche, which once
                contained&nbsp;a statue or mosaic picture. The walls are built of fine neat
                brickwork. One campanile (that of S. Maria Maggiore), the largest and&nbsp;once the
                handsomest of all, has string-courses of enamelled and&nbsp;coloured terra-cotta.
                The slender columns of the windows have&nbsp;often proved insufficient to support
                the weight, and so many of the&nbsp;arches are built up.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Though but little used for churches, the Gothic style, in its
                modified Italian form, was almost Universallv employed for domestic</span></p>

                class="font2"> brick was used for the main walls, the lowest story being
                often&nbsp;supported on an arcade of pointed arches and marble columns.
                The&nbsp;windows were usually formed of large marble slabs with trefoilshaped heads
                or cusped arches. As a rule the upper stories projected slightly over the lower
                wall, and were supported on small&nbsp;ornamental machicolations. The top story
                frequently had an open&nbsp;loggia, with rows of pointed arches. AVhen vaulting was
                used it&nbsp;also was of the pointed form, usually in simple quadripartite
                bays,&nbsp;with slightly moulded groin-ribs. The finest existing specimen
                ol&nbsp;this style is the palace built about 1300 by Boniface VIIL
                (Gaetanc&nbsp;family), enclosing the tomb of Cecilia AIetella on the Via
                Appia,&nbsp;with a graceful little chapel within the precincts of the castle.
                This&nbsp;building is very worthy of study ; the remaining part is well preserved.
                Many houses of this period, though generally much injured&nbsp;by alterations, still
                exist in Rome. They are mostly in out-of-the-way alleys, and, not being mentioned in
                any books, are seldom examined. The Ghetto and the quarter near the Ponte Rotto
                contain&nbsp;many of these interesting buildings, as well as some of the
                most&nbsp;crowded parts of the Trastevere district ; all are rapidly disappearing
                under the wholesale destruction of old streets now in progress.&nbsp;Among those
                which may possibly escape for a while is the 13th-century house -where Giulio Romano
                lived, near the Palazzo di&nbsp;Venezia, and the Albergo del Orso, at the end of the
                Via di Tordi-nona, of the same period, which was an inn in the 16th century&nbsp;and
                is one still ; this has remains of a fine upper loggia, with rich&nbsp;cornices in
                moulded terra-cotta ; the lowest story has pointed vaulting resting on many pillars.
                Another graceful but less stately&nbsp;house exists, though sadly mutilated,
                opposite the entrance to the&nbsp;atrium of S. Cecilia in Trastevere.@@<sup>5</sup>
                Very few now remain of the&nbsp;once numerous lofty towers built by the turbulent
                Roman barons&nbsp;for purposes of defence. The finest, the Torre della AIilizia on
                the&nbsp;Viminal, was built in the 13th century by the sons of Petrus Alexius
                ;&nbsp;of about the same date is the Torre dei Conti, near the forum
                oi&nbsp;Augustus, built by AIarchione of Arezzo ; both these were once
                much&nbsp;higher than they are now ; they are very simple and noble in
                design,&nbsp;with massive walls faced with neat brickwork, much resembling&nbsp;that
                of the 2d century.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Till the 14th century the Lateran was the usual residence of the pope
                ; this was once a very extensive building, covering four times&nbsp;its present
                area. The original house is<sub>ι</sub>said to have belonged to the&nbsp;senator
                Plautius Lateranus in the reign of Nero ; but the existing&nbsp;part on the line of
                the Aurelian wall is of the 3d century. This&nbsp;house, which had become the
                property of the emperors, was given&nbsp;by Constantine as a residence for S.
                Sylvester ; it was very much&nbsp;enlarged at many periods during the next ten
                centuries ; in 1308 a&nbsp;great part was burnt, and in 1586 the ancient palace was
                completely&nbsp;destroyed by Sixtus V., and the present palace built by
                Domenico&nbsp;Fontana. The Cappella Sancta Sanctorum (see list of
                Cosmati&nbsp;works) is the only relic of the older palace.@@<sup>6 </sup>The present
                palace&nbsp;has never been used as a papal residence ; in the 18th century
                it&nbsp;was an orphan asylum, and is now a museum of classical sculpture&nbsp;and
                early Christian remains.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Vatican palace also appears to have originated in a house which
                existed in the time of Constantine. This was rebuilt by&nbsp;Innocent III. (c. 1200)
                and enlarged by Nicholas III. (1277-80).&nbsp;It did not, however, become the fixed
                residence of the popes till&nbsp;after the return from Avignon in 1377. In 1415 John
                XXIIL&nbsp;connected the Vatican and the castle of S. Angelo by a
                covered&nbsp;passage carried on arches. But little of the existing palace is
                older&nbsp;than the 15th century ; Nicholas V. in 1447 began its reconstruction on a
                magnificent scale, and this was earned on by Sixtus IV.&nbsp;(Sistine chapel),
                Alexander VI. (Appartamenti Borgia), Julius II.&nbsp;and Leo X. (Bramante’s cortile
                and paintings by Raphael), and&nbsp;Paul III. (Sala Regia and Cappella Paolina by
                Antonio da Sangallo).&nbsp;Sixtus V. and his successors built the lofty part of the
                palace on&nbsp;the east of Bramante’s cortile. The Scala Regia was built by
                Bernini&nbsp;for Urban VIII., the Aluseo Pio-Clementino under ClementXIV.&nbsp;and
                Pius VI., the Braccio Nuovo under Pius A<sup>r</sup>IL, and lastly the&nbsp;grand
                stairs up to the cortile were added by Pius IX.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Quirinal palace, now occupied by the king of Italy, is devoid of
                architectural merit. It stands on the highest part of the hill,&nbsp;on the site of
                part of thé baths of Constantine. This palace was&nbsp;begun in 1574, under Gregory
                XIII., by Flaminio Ponzio, and was&nbsp;completed by Fontana and AIaderna under
                subsequent popes.</span></p>
