<p><label>ROSS</label>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi> (1777-1856), arctic voyager, was the fourth son of the Rev. Andrew Ross, minister of Inch, Wigtonshire, where he was born in 1777. He entered the navy in 1786. In 1818 he sailed in command of an Arctic expedition (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Polar Regions,</hi> vol. xix. p. 319), an account of which he published, under the title <hi rend="italic">Voyage of Discovery for the Purpose of Exploring Eaffirfs Bay,</hi> in 1819. In 1829, through the munificence of his friend Sir Felix Booth, he was able to undertake a second expedition (see vol. xix. p. 320). Shortly after his return in 1833 he was knighted, made C.B., and elected a member of many learned societies. In accordance with a promise made to Sir John Franklin, he undertook a third expedition in 1850 and remained one winter on the ice, but accomplished nothing. His own account of the causes of his failure is given in a pamphlet published in 1855. He died 31st August 1856.</p><p>Ross also wrote <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on Navigation by Steam,</hi> 1828 ; <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence of Admiral Lord De Saumarez,</hi> 1838 ; <hi rend="italic">Arctic Expedition,</hi> 1850 ; and several other minor works.</p>
