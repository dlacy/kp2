<p><span class="font2">With the death of Edward there came a period of reaction lasting for five years. Queen Mary, unshaken in her attachment&nbsp; to the ancient faith and the papal monarchy,&nbsp;was able with the sanction of a subservient parliament to turn back the wheels of ecclesiastical legislation, to restore the old religion, and to reunite the&nbsp;English Church with the papal monarchy; the pope’s&nbsp;legate, Cardinal Pole, was primate of all England. Then, the&nbsp;ancient heresy laws having been revived, came the burnings of&nbsp;Rogers, Hooker, Latimer, Ridley, Cranmer and many a less&nbsp;noteworthy champion of the new religion. It would seem as&nbsp;if this sharp, uncompromising reaction was what was needed&nbsp;to produce a popular realization of the contrast between the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesia anglicana</span><span class="font2"> of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., and the alternative of “ perfect obedience to the See Apostolic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Elizabeth, who succeeded her sister Mary in 1558, was suspected to be Protestant in her leanings, and her adviser, Cecil, had received his training as secretary of the Protector&nbsp;Somerset; but the general European situation as&nbsp;well as the young queen’s own temperament precluded&nbsp; any abrupt or ostentatious change in religious&nbsp;matters. The new sovereign’s first proclamation was directed&nbsp;against all such preaching as might lead to contention and the&nbsp;breaking of the common quiet. In 1559 ten of Henry VIII.’s&nbsp;acts were revived. On Easter Sunday the queen ventured&nbsp;to display her personal preference for the Protestant conception&nbsp;of the eucharist by forbidding the celebrant in her chapel to&nbsp;elevate the host. The royal supremacy was reasserted, the&nbsp;title being modified into “ supreme governor ”; and a new&nbsp;edition of Edward VI.’s second Prayer Book, with a few&nbsp;changes, was issued. The Marian bishops who refused to&nbsp;recognize these changes were deposed and imprisoned, but&nbsp;care was taken to preserve the “ succession ” by consecrating&nbsp;others in due form to take their places.@@1 Four years later the&nbsp;Thirty-nine Articles imposed an official creed upon the English&nbsp;nation. This was Protestant in its general character: in its&nbsp;appeal to the Scriptures as the sole rule of faith (Art. VI.), its&nbsp;repudiation of the authority of Rome (Art. XXXVII.), its&nbsp;definition of the Church (Art. XIX.), its insistence on justification&nbsp; by faith only (Art. XI.) and repudiation of the sacrifice&nbsp;of the Mass (Arts. XXVIII. and XXXI.). As supreme governor&nbsp;of the Church of England the sovereign strictly controlled all&nbsp;ecclesiastical legislation and appointed royal delegates to hear&nbsp;appeals from the ecclesiastical courts, to be a “ papist ” or to&nbsp;“ hear Mass ” (which was construed as the same thing) was to&nbsp;risk incurring the terrible penalties of high treason. By the&nbsp;Act of Uniformity (1559) a uniform ritual, the Book of Common&nbsp;Prayer, was imposed upon clergy and laity alike, and no liberty&nbsp;of public worship was permitted. Every subject was bound&nbsp;under penalty of a fine to attend church on Sunday. While&nbsp;there was in a certain sense freedom of opinion, all printers&nbsp;had to seek a licence from the government for every manner of&nbsp;book or paper, and heresy was so closely affiliated with treason&nbsp;that the free expression of thought, whether reactionary or revolutionary, was beset with grave danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Attempts to estimate the width of the gulf separating the Church of England in Elizabeth’s time from the corresponding&nbsp;institution as it existed in the early years of her father’s reign&nbsp;are likely to be gravely affected by personal bias. There is a&nbsp;theory that no sweeping revolution in dogma took place, but&nbsp;that only a few medieval beliefs were modified or rejected owing&nbsp;to the practical abuses to which they had given rise. To&nbsp;Professor A. F. Pollard, for example, “ The Reformation in&nbsp;England was mainly a domestic affair, a national protest against&nbsp;national grievances rather than part of a cosmopolitan movement&nbsp; toward doctrinal change ”(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Camb. Mod. Hist. </span><span class="font2">ii. 478-9).&nbsp;This estimate appeals to persons of widely different views and&nbsp;temperaments. It is as grateful to those who, like many&nbsp;“ Anglo-Catholics,” desire on religious grounds to establish the&nbsp;doctrinal continuity of the Anglican Church with that of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">middle ages, as it is obvious to those who, like W. K. Clifford, perceive in the ecclesiastical organization and its influence&nbsp;nothing more than a perpetuation of demoralizing medieval&nbsp;superstition. The nonconformists have, moreover, never&nbsp;wearied of denouncing the “ papistical ” conservatism of the&nbsp;Anglican establishment. On the other hand, the impartial&nbsp; historical student cannot compare the Thirty-nine Articles&nbsp;with the contemporaneous canons and decrees of the council of&nbsp;Trent without being impressed by striking contrasts between the&nbsp;two sets of dogmas. Their spirit is very different. The unmistakable&nbsp; rejection on the part of the English Church of the&nbsp;conception of the eucharist as a sacrifice had alone many wide-reaching implications. Even although the episcopal organization&nbsp; was retained, the conception of “ tradition,” of the conciliar&nbsp;powers, of the “characters” of the priest, of the celibate life,&nbsp;of purgatory, of “ good works,” &amp;c.—all these serve clearly to&nbsp;differentiate the teaching of the English Church before and after&nbsp;the Reformation. From this standpoint it is obviously unhistorical&nbsp; to deny that England had a very important part in&nbsp;the cosmopolitan movement toward doctrinal change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The little backward kingdom of Scotland definitely accepted the new faith two years after Elizabeth’s accession, and after&nbsp;having for centuries sided with France against England,&nbsp;she was inevitably forced by the Reformation into an&nbsp;alliance with her ancient enemy to the south when they&nbsp;both faced a confederation of Catholic powers. The&nbsp;first martyr of Luther’s gospel had been Patrick Hamilton, who&nbsp;had suffered in 1528; but in spite of a number of executions the&nbsp;new ideas spread, even among the nobility. John Knox, who,&nbsp;after a chequered career, had come under the influence of&nbsp;Calvin at Geneva, returned to Scotland for a few months in&nbsp;1555, and shortly after (1557) that part of the Scottish nobility&nbsp;which had been won over to the new faith formed their first&nbsp;“ covenant ” for mutual protection. These “ Lords of the&nbsp;Congregation ” were able to force some concessions from the&nbsp;queen regent. Knox appeared in Scotland again in 1559, and&nbsp;became a sort of second Calvin. He opened negotiations with&nbsp;Cecil, who induced the reluctant Elizabeth to form an alliance&nbsp;with the Lords of the Congregation, and the English sent a fleet&nbsp;to drive away the French, who were endeavouring to keep their&nbsp;hold on Scotland. In 1560 a confession of faith was prepared&nbsp;by John Knox and five companions. This was adopted by the&nbsp;Scottish parliament, with the resolution “ the bishops of Rome&nbsp;have no jurisdiction nor authoritie in this Realme in tymes&nbsp;cuming.” The alliance of England and the Scottish Protestants&nbsp;against the French, and the common secession from the papal&nbsp;monarchy, was in a sense the foundation and beginning of&nbsp;Great Britain. Scottish Calvinism was destined to exercise no&nbsp;little influence, not only on the history of England, but on the&nbsp;form that the Protestant faith was to take in lands beyond the&nbsp;seas, at the time scarcely known to the Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While France was deeply affected during the 16th century by the Protestant revolt, its government never undertook any&nbsp;thoroughgoing reform of the Church. During the&nbsp;latter part of the century its monarchs were engaged in a bloody struggle with a powerful religious-political party, the Huguenots, who finally won a&nbsp;toleration which they continued to enjoy until the&nbsp;revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. It was not until 1789&nbsp;that the French Church of the middle ages lost its vast possessions&nbsp;and was subjected to </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">fundamental reconstruction by the&nbsp;Civil Constitution </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the Clergy (1791).@@<sup>2</sup> Yet no summary of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> In 1795 the National Convention gruffly declared that the Republic would no longer subsidize any form of worship or furnish&nbsp;buildings for religious services. “ The law recognizes no minister&nbsp;of religion, and no one is to appear in public with costumes or ornaments&nbsp; used in religious ceremonies.” Bonaparte, in the Concordat&nbsp;which he forced upon the pope in 1801, did not provide for the return&nbsp;of any of the lands of the Church which had been sold, but agreed&nbsp;that the government should pay the salaries of bishops and priests,&nbsp;whose appointment it controlled. While the Roman Catholic religion&nbsp; was declared to be that accepted by the majority of Frenchmen, the state subsidized the Reformed Church, those adhering&nbsp;to the Augsburg Confession and the Jewish community.
