<p><span class="font5">He made ſimilar experiments with priſms, pyramids, and other bodies, and found a complete confirmation&nbsp;of his affertion, that priſms of equal lengths and ſec-tions, though diſſhnilar, dragged equal quantities of&nbsp;fluid ; that ſimilar priſms. and priſms not ſimilar, but&nbsp;whofe length were as the ſquare-root of their fictions, dragged quantities proportional to their bulks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He found a general value of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font5"> for priſmatic bodies, which alone may be conſidered as a valuable truth ;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">namely, that « = 0,705 — + 1,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From all theſe circumftances, we fee an intimate connection between the preffures, non∙preffures, and&nbsp;the fluid dragged along with the body. Indeed this&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">immediately deducible from the ſirſt principles ; for&nbsp;what Mr Buat calls the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dragged fluid</span><span class="font5"> is in fact a cer-tain portion of the whole change of motion produced&nbsp;in the direction of the bodies motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was found, that with reſpect to thin planes, ſpheres, and pyramidal bodies of equal bafis, the reſiſtances were&nbsp;inverfily as the quantities of fluid dragged along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inte∏igent reader will readily obferve, that theſe views of the Chevalier Buat are not ſo much diſcoveries&nbsp;of new principles as they are claſſiſications of conſe-quences, which may all be deduced from the general prin-¢iples employed by D’Alembert and other mathemati-cians. But they greatly aſſiſt us in forming notions of&nbsp;different parts of the procedure of nature in the mutual&nbsp;action of fluids and ſolids on each other. This rauſt be&nbsp;very acceptable in a ſubject which it is by no means&nbsp;probable that we ſhall be able to inveftigate with mathematical preciſion. we have given an account of&nbsp;theſe laſt obſervations, that we may omit nothing of&nbsp;confiquence that has been written on the ſubject ; and&nbsp;we take this opportunity of recommending the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hydraulique</span><span class="font5"> of Mr Buat as a moſt ingenious work, containing&nbsp;more original, ingenious, and practically uſeful thoughts,&nbsp;than all the performances we have met with. His doctrine of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the principle of uniform motion oſ βuids in pipes&nbsp;and open canals,</span><span class="font5"> will be of immenſe fervice to all engi-F,eers, and enable them to determine with ſuſſicient preciſion the moft important queſtions in their profeſſion ;&nbsp;queſtions which at preſent they are hardly able to gueſs&nbsp;at. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rivers</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">WATER Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only circumſtance which we have not noticed in detail, is the change of reſiſtance produced by the void,&nbsp;or tendency to a, void, which obtains behind the body ;&nbsp;and we omitted a particular difcuſſion, merely becauie&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font5">could ſay nothing ſuſſiciently preciſe on the ſubject.&nbsp;Perfons not accuſtomed to the difiuſſions in the phyſico-mathematical ſciences, are apt to entertain doubts or&nbsp;falfi notions connected with this circumſtance, which&nbsp;we ſhall attempt to remove ; and with this we ſhall conclude this long and unſatisfactory differtation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">fluid were perfectly incoropreſſible, and were contained in a vefftl incapable of extenſion, it is impoſſible that any void could be formed behind the body;&nbsp;and in this caſe it is not very eaſy to fie how motion&nbsp;could be performed in it. A ſphere moved in ſuch a&nbsp;medium could not advance the ſmalleſt diſtance, unleſs&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fame</span><span class="font5"> particles of the fluid, in filling up the fpace left&nbsp;⅜y it, moved with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">velocity next to infinite. Some</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font5">degree oſ compreffibility, however ſmall, ſcems </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">neceſ</span><span class="font5">lary. If this be inſenſible, it may be rigidly demonſtrated, that an external force of compreſſion will make no </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ſenfible</span><span class="font5"> change in the internal motions, or in the reſiſtances. <sup>r</sup>Γhis indeed is not obvious, but is an immediate conſequence of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">quaquaverpum</span><span class="font5"> preffure of fluids.&nbsp;As much as the preſſiire </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> augmented by the externaI&nbsp;compreſſions on one ſide of a body, fo much is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font5"> augmented on the other ſide ; and the fame muſt be faid of&nbsp;every particle. Nothing more is neceffary for ficuring&nbsp;the ſame motions by the ſame partial and internal forces;&nbsp;and this is fully verified by experiment, water re-mains equally fluid under any compreffion3. In ſome&nbsp;of Sir Iſaac Newton’s experiments balls of four inches&nbsp;diameter were made ſo light as to preponderate in wa-ter only three grains. '1 heſe balls defcended in the&nbsp;ſame manner as they would have defcended in a fluid&nbsp;where the reſiſtance was equal in every part ; yet, when&nbsp;they were near the bottom of a veſtel nine feet deep,&nbsp;the compreſſion round them was at laſt 2400 times&nbsp;the moving force ; whereas, when near the top of the&nbsp;veffel, it was not above 50 or 60 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in a fluid ſenſibly compreſſible, or which is not confined, a void may be left behind the body. Its motion may be ſo ſwift that the ſurrounding preffure may&nbsp;not ſuffice for filling up the deſerted ſpace ; and, in&nbsp;this caſe, a ſtatical preffure will be added to the reſiſtance.&nbsp;This may be the caſe in a veffel or pond of water&nbsp;having an open ſurface expofed to the finite or limited&nbsp;preffure of the atmoſphere. The queftion now is, whe-ther the reſiftance will be increafid by an increaſe of&nbsp;external preffure ? Suppoſing a ſphere moving near the&nbsp;ſurface oſ water, and another moving equally faſt at&nbsp;four times the depth. If the motion be ſo ſwift that a&nbsp;void is formed in both caſes, there is no doubt but that&nbsp;the ſphere which moves at the greateſt depth is moſt&nbsp;reſiſted by the preffure of the water. If there is no&nbsp;void in either cafi, then, becauſe the quadruple depth&nbsp;would cauſe the water to flow in with only a double velocity, it would ſeem that the reſiftance would be&nbsp;greater ; and indeed the water flowing in laterally with&nbsp;a double velocity produces a quadruple non-preffure.—&nbsp;But, on the other hand, the preffure at a ſmall depth&nbsp;may be inſufficient for preventing a void, while that&nbsp;below effectually prevents it ; and this was obfirved in&nbsp;ſome experiments of Chevalier de Borda. The effect,&nbsp;therefore, of greater immeriion, or of greater compreſſion, in an elaſtic fluid, does not follow a preciſe ratio&nbsp;oſ the preffure, but depends partly on abſolute quantities. It cannot, therefore, be ftated by any very ſimple&nbsp;formula what increaſe or diminution of reſiſtance will&nbsp;reſult from a greater depth ; and it is chiefly on this&nbsp;account that experiments made with models of ſhips and&nbsp;mills are not concluſive with reſpect to the performance&nbsp;of a large machine of the ſame proportions, without corrections, ſometimes pretty intricate, we affert, however, with great confidence, that this is of all methods&nbsp;the moſt exact, and infinitely more certain than any&nbsp;thing that can be deduced from the moſt elaborate calculation from theory. If the reſiſtances at all depths be&nbsp;equal, the proportionality of the total reſiſtance to the&nbsp;body is exact, and perfectly conformable to obfirvation&lt;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is only in great velocities where the depth has any material influence, and the influence is not near ſo con-ſiderable as we ſhould, at ſirſt light, ſuppofi ; for, in&nbsp;eſtimating the effect </span><span class="font3">oi </span><span class="font5">immerſion, which has a relation</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
