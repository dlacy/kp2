an enigmatical repreſentation of ſome name, &amp;c. by uſing figures or pictures inſtead of words, or parts of words. Camden mentions an inſtance of this abſurd kind of wit in a gallant who expreffed his love to a woman named <hi rend="italic">Roſe Hill,</hi> by painting in the bor-der of his gown a roſe, a hill, an eye, a loaf, and a well ; which, in the ftyle of the rebus, reads, " <hi rend="italic">Roſe Hill I iove well.’*</hi> This kind of wit was long practiſed by the great, who took the pains to ſind devices for their names. It was, however, happily ridiculed by Ben Johnſon, in the humorous deſcription of Abel Drug-ger’s device in the Alchemiſt ; by the Spectator, in the device of Jack of Newberry ; at which time the rebus, being raiſed to ſign-poſts, was grown out of faſhion at court.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rebus</hi> is alſo uſed by the chemical writers fometimes to ſignify four milk, and ſometimes for what they call the ultimate matter of which all bodies are compoſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rebus,</hi> in heraldry, a coat of arms which bears an alluſion. to the name of the perſon ; as three caſtles, for Caftleton ; three cups, for Butler ; three conies, for Coniſby; a kind of bearings which are of great antiquity.</p>
