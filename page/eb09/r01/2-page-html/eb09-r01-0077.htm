<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TurnilAt ? The latter is far the more likely case, when we consider that the old form of the story of the Hebrews in&nbsp;Egypt is throughout deficient in precise geographical data,&nbsp;as might be expected in a history not committed to writing&nbsp;till the Israelites had resided for centuries in another and&nbsp;distant land. The post-exile or priestly author indeed&nbsp;gives a detailed route for the exodus (which is lacking in&nbsp;the older story), but he, we know, was a student of geography and might supplement tradition by what he could&nbsp;gather from traders as to the caravan routes.@@<sup>1</sup> And at all&nbsp;events to argue that, because the Hebrews worked at a city&nbsp;named after Rameses, they did so in the reign of the&nbsp;founder, is false reasoning, for the Hebrew expression&nbsp;might equally be used of repairs or new works of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It appears, however, from remains aiul inscriptions that ltameses II. did build in Wady Tumilat, especially at Tell Maskhuta, which&nbsp;Lepsius therefore identified with the Raamses of Exodus. This&nbsp;identification is commemorated in the name of the adjacent railway station. But recent excavations on the spot have brought to&nbsp;light further inscriptions, on the ground of which Naville makes&nbsp;the ruins those of Pithom and further identifies Pithom with the&nbsp;later Heroopolis. The identity of Pithom and Heroopolis is also&nbsp;favoured by comparison of the LXX. and the Coptic of Gen. xlvi.&nbsp;28. See E. Naville, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Store-city of Pithom and the Route of the&nbsp;Exodus,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 18S5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">li AMES WAR AM, a small island situated between Ceylon and India, at the entrance of Palk Strait in the&nbsp;Gulf of Manaar, in 9° 18' N. lat. and 79° 22' E. long. It&nbsp;is about 14 miles long by 5 wide, is low and sandy, and for&nbsp;the most part uncultivated. The estimated population of&nbsp;the island is about 14,000. It contains one of the most&nbsp;venerated Hindu shrines, founded, according to tradition,&nbsp;by Rama himself, which for centuries has been the resort&nbsp;of thousands of pilgrims from all parts of India. To the&nbsp;south of this great temple there is a freshwater lake&nbsp;about 3 miles in circumference. At the western extremity&nbsp;of the island is the small but busy port of Pambam, which&nbsp;gives its name to the channel between India and Ceylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rameswaram island is the first link in the chain of islets and rocks forming Adam’s Bridge. Geological evidence shows that&nbsp;this gap was once bridged by a continuous isthmus, which, according to the temple records, was breached by a violent storm in 1480.&nbsp;Operations for removing the obstacles in the channel, and for&nbsp;deepening and widening it, were begun in 1838. The main channel&nbsp;has a minimum depth of 14 feet; its length is 4232 feet and its&nbsp;breadth 80 feet. A second channel to the south, called the Kilkarai&nbsp;Passage, is 2100 feet long, 150 feet wide, and is dredged to a depth&nbsp;of 12 feet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMPUR, a native state of India, in the Rohilkhand division of the North-Western Provinces, lying between&nbsp;28° 26' and 29° 10' N. lat. and between 78°54' and 79°33'&nbsp;E. long. It is bounded on the N. and W. by the British&nbsp;district of MurAdAbAd, and on the N.E. and S.E. by the&nbsp;district of Bareli. The country is level and generally&nbsp;fertile ; it is well watered in the north by the rivers Kosila&nbsp;and Xaliul and in the south by the RAmgangA. It&nbsp;adjoins the Tarai on the north, at the foot of the HimA-layas, and is exceedingly unhealthy. The total area of&nbsp;the state is 945 square miles, with a population (1881)&nbsp;of 541,914 (males 282,359, females 259,555), of whom&nbsp;302,989 were Hindus and 238,925 Mohammedans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The revenue of Rampur in 1883-84 was £167,031 and the ordinary annual expenditure £160,134. Rice, sugar, hides, and a&nbsp;kind of damask are the principal exports, and the imports comprise&nbsp;elephants, English cloth, and groceries and salt. During the&nbsp;mutiny of 1857 the nawab of Rampur rendered important services&nbsp;to the British, for which he received a grant of land assessed at&nbsp;£12,852 in perpetuity, besides other honours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMPUR, capital of the above state, stands on the left bank of the Kosila in 28° 48' N. lat. and 79° 4' E.&nbsp;long.; it is surrounded by a belt of bamboo trees and</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">brushwood, with a low ruined parapet, and is the residence of the nawab, who represents the Rohilla chieftains of Rohilkhand. A lofty mosque stands in the marketplace ; the streets are densely crowded together and principally built of mud. The population of the town in 1881&nbsp;numbered 74,250 (males 36,355, females 37,895); it is&nbsp;famous for fine shawls and damask, which are exported to&nbsp;all parts of India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Allan </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1686-1758), author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a pastoral drama in the Lowland Scotch dialect,&nbsp;was born in Lanarkshire in 1686. An Edinburgh barber&nbsp;set agoing the literary movement in Scotland that culminated in the poetry of Burns. This peasant-poetry is&nbsp;often spoken of as if it were a spontaneous indigenous&nbsp;product, but the harvest that ripened towards the close of&nbsp;the 18th century had its seed-time earlier, and the seeds&nbsp;were imported from England. Allan Ramsay was a&nbsp;peasant by birth (although he claimed kinship with the&nbsp;noble family of Dalhousie)—the son of a manager of lead-mines in Lanarkshire; but the country-bred lad was transplanted to a town, being apprenticed at the age of fifteen&nbsp;to a barber in Edinburgh. In this calling he somehow&nbsp;made the acquaintance of a band of Jacobite young gentlemen of literary tastes, was admitted to the convivialities&nbsp;of their “Easy Club,” and formally adjudged “a gentleman.” The basis of the club seems to have been literary,&nbsp;the members taking fancy names of celebrities,—Buchanan,&nbsp;Boece, Bickerstaff, and so forth. Ramsay’s name was&nbsp;Bickerstaff, and the fact is of some importance as showing&nbsp;how he was brought into contact with the discussion of the&nbsp;theory of pastoral poetry among the London wits of the&nbsp;time. Ramsay’s connexion with the Easy Club lay between&nbsp;1712 and 1715, and in the course of that period occurred&nbsp;the dispute about pastoral poetry occasioned by the great&nbsp;publication of Pope’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Windsor Forest</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pope). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for 7tli April 1713 (No. 23) contained a description of a true pastoral poem, which was afterwards realized&nbsp;by Ramsay in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> with such scrupulous&nbsp;fidelity in every detail that the criticism might fairly be&nbsp;described as the recipe from which the poem was made.&nbsp;There is not a clearer case in literary history of the influence of criticism on creation; Ramsay’s great pastoral—&nbsp;and it well deserves the epithet—was the main outcome&nbsp;of the prolonged discussion of that kind of poetry by the&nbsp;Queen Anne wits. “Paint the manners of actual rustic life,”&nbsp;said the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> critic to the poet, “ not the manners of&nbsp;artificial shepherds and shepherdesses in a fictitious golden&nbsp;age; use actual rustic dialect; instead of satyrs and fauns&nbsp;and nymphs introduce the supernatural creatures of modern&nbsp;superstition.” These precepts Ramsay diligently observed,&nbsp;and the result was that his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> not only&nbsp;attracted attention among the learned students of poetry as&nbsp;a literary curiosity, the first genuine pastoral after Theocritus, but at once became a favourite and a living force&nbsp;among the peasantry in whose dialect it was written and&nbsp;for wdiose characters it furnished ideal models. There was&nbsp;hardly a farmhouse in Scotland in which a copy of the&nbsp;poem was not to be found, and the moral force of the ideal&nbsp;exhibited in the hero Patie may be traced in the character&nbsp;of Burns and many another Scottish peasant-bard in whom&nbsp;ostentatious libertinism is not redeemed by the same genius.&nbsp;From a moral point of view a better exemplar than Ramsay’s ideal hero might well have been desired. The poct-laureate of the Easy Club took his moral tone from the&nbsp;poets of the Restoration, with whom his Jacobite boon companions were in full sympathy; and thus through the genial,&nbsp;convivial, quick-witted, and slily humorous barber the spirit&nbsp;of the Restoration passed into the homes of the Scotch&nbsp;peasantry to do battle with the austere spirit of the kirk.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
