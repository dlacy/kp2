He was also elected in 1887 president of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, to whose <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>  he was a constant contributor. The most important of his contributions to Egyptology are his Hibbert Lectures on “ The Religion of the Egyptians,” delivered in 1879; and the translation of <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Dead, </hi>with an ample commentary, published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>  of the society over which he presided. He retired from the Museum under the superannuation rule in 1891, and died in London on the 14th of October 1897. He had been knighted the year before his death. He married in 1857 Ludovica von Brentano, member of a well-known German Uterary family.</p><p>RENOUVIER, CHARLES BERNARD (1815-1903), French philosopher, was born at Montpellier on the 1st of January 1818, and educated in Paris at the École Polytechnique. In early life he took an interest in poUtics, and the approval extended by Hippolyte Carnot to his <hi rend="italic">Manuel républicain de Fhomme et du citoyen</hi>  (1848) was the occasion of that minister’s fall. He never held public employment, but spent his life writing, retired from the w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>orld. He died on the ist of September 1903. Ren-ouvier was the first Frenchman after Malebranche to formulate â complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Kant’s, as his chosen term “ Néo-criticisme ” indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism. The two leading ideas are a dislike to the Unknowable in aU its forms, and a reliance on the validity of our personal experience. The former accounts for his acceptance of Kant’s phenomenalism, combined with rejection of the thing in itself. It accounts, too, for his polemic on the one hand against a Substantial Soul, a Buddhistic Absolute, an Infinite Spiritual Substance; on the other hand against the no less mysterious material or dynamic substratum by which naturalistic Monism explains the world. He holds that nothing exists except .presentations, which are not merely sensational, and have an objective aspect no less than a subjective. To explain the formal organization of our experience he adopts a modified version of the Kantian categories. The insistence on the validity of personal experience leads Renouvier to a yet more important divergence from Kant in his treatment of volition. Liberty, he says, in a much wider sense than Kant, is man’s fundamental characteristic. Human freedom acts in the phenomenal, not in an imaginary noümenal sphere. Belief is not intellectual merely, but is determined by an act of will affirming what we hold to be morally good. In his religious views Renouvier makes a considerable approximation to Leibnitz. He holds that we are rationally justified in affirming human immörtality and the existence of a finite God who is to be a constitutional ruler, but not a despot, over the souls of men. He would, however, regard atheism as preferable to a belief in an infinite Deity.</p><p>His chief works are: <hi rend="italic">Essais de critique générale</hi>  (1854-64), <hi rend="italic">Science de la morale</hi>  (1869), <hi rend="italic">Uchronie</hi>  (1876), <hi rend="italic">Esquisse Pune classification systématique des doctrines philosophiques</hi>  (1885-86), <hi rend="italic">Philosophie analytique de l’histoire</hi>  (1896-97), <hi rend="italic">Histoire et solution des problèmes métaphysiques</hi>  (1901); <hi rend="italic">Victor Hugo*.

(1900) 7466, of whom 1089 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 10,711. It is served by the New York Central and the Boston &amp; Albany railways, which have shops here, and is connected with Albany by three bridges across the Hudson. Rensselaer, originally called Greenbush, was first settled in 1631, and the site formed part of the large tract bought from the Indians by the agents of KiUian van Rensselaer and known as RensseIaerwyck. In 1810 a square mile of land within the present city limits was acquired by a land speculator, was divided into lots and offered for sale. Development followed, and five years later the village was incorporated. In 1897 Greenbush was chartered as a city, and its name was changed to Rensselaer. Its limits were extended in 1902 by the annexation of the viUage of Bath (pop. in 1900, 2504) and the western part of the township of East Greenbush. Rensselaer manufactures knit-goods, wool shoddy, felt, &amp;c.</p><p>RENT. Various species of rent appear in Roman Law: rent <hi rend="italic">(canon)</hi>  under the long leasehold tenure of Emphyteusis; rent <hi rend="italic">(reditus)</hi>  of a farm; ground-rent <hi rend="italic">(solarium)*,</hi>  rent of state lands <hi rend="italic">(vectigal) ; </hi>and the annual rent <hi rend="italic">(prensio)</hi>  payable for the <hi rend="italic">jus Superficiarum</hi>  or right to the perpetual enjoyment of anything built on the surface of land. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Law.)</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">English Law. (As</hi>  to the rent of apartments, &amp;c., see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lodger and Lodgings.)</hi>—Rent is a certain and periodical payment or service made or rendered by the tenant of a corporeal hereditament and issuing out of (the property of) such hereditament. Its characteristics, therefore, are (1) certainty in amount; (2) periodicity in payment or rendering; (3) the fact that rent is <hi rend="italic">yielded</hi>  and is, therefore, said “ to lie in <hi rend="italic">render,”</hi>  as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">profits d prendre</hi>  in general, which are taken, and are, therefore, said to lie in <hi rend="italic">prendre;</hi>  (4) that it must issue out of (the profits of) a corporeal hereditament. A rent cannot be reserved out of incorporeal hereditaments such as advowsons (Co. <hi rend="italic">Lilt.</hi>  47a, 142a). But rent may be reserved out of estates in reversion or remainder (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Property)</hi>  which are not purely incorporeal. It is not essential that rent should consist in a payment of money. Apart from the rendering of services, the delivery of hens, horses, wheat, &amp;c., may constitute a rent. But, at the present day, rent is generally a sum of money paid for the occupation of land. It is important to notice that this conception of rent was attained at a comparatively late period in the history of the law. The earliest rent seems to have been a form of personal service, generally labour on land, and was fixed by custom. The exaction of a competition or rack rent beyond that limit ed by custom was, if one may judge from the old Brehon law of Ireland, due to the presence upon the land of strangers in blood, probably at first outcasts from some other group.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The strict feudal theory of rent admitted labour on the lord’s land as a lower form, and developed the military service due to the crown or a lord as a higher form. Rent service is the oldest and most dignified kind of existing rent. It is the only one to which the power of distress attaches at common law, giving the landlord a preferential right over other creditors exercisable without the intervention of judicial authority (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Distress).</hi>  The increasing importance of socage tenure, arising in part from the convenience of paying a certain amount, whether in money or kind, rather than comparatively uncertain services, led to the gradual evolution of the modern view of rent as a sum due by contract between two independent persons. At the same time the primitive feeling which regarded the position of landlord and tenant from a social rather than a commercial point of view is still of importance.</p><p>Rents, as they now exist in England, are divided into two great classes—rent service and rent charge.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Rent Service.—</hi>A rent service is so called because by it a tenure by means of service is created between the landlord and the tenant. The service is now represented by fealty, and is nothing more than nominal. Rent service is said to be incident to the reversion—that is, a grant of the reversion carries the rent with it (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Remainder).</hi>  A power of distress is incident</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>The three rents are: rack rent from a person of a strange tribe, a fair rent from one of the tribe, and the stipulated rent which is paid equally by the tribe and the strange tribe.”—<hi rend="italic">Senchus Mor, </hi>P- 159, cited by Maine, <hi rend="italic">Village Communities,</hi>  p. 187.
