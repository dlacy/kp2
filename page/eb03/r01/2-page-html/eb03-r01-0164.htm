<p><span class="font3">years, if the body was not honoured with funeral rites. Among the Scandinavians, a natural death was attended with infamy, while a violent death, particularly in&nbsp;battle, gave a title to ſit in the halls of odin, and to&nbsp;quaff beer from the ikulls of enemies. Among the&nbsp;Tlaſcalans, it was only the great that were permitted .&nbsp;to animate birds and the nobler quadrupeds ; the lower&nbsp;ranks were transformed into weaſels, into paultry&nbsp;beetles, and fuch mean animals. Among the Mexicans,&nbsp;thoſe who were drowned, who died of a dropſy, tumors, or wounds, or ſuch like diſeaſes, went along with&nbsp;the children that had been ſacriſiced to the god of water, and in a cool and delightful place were allowed to&nbsp;indulge in delicious repaſts and varieties of pleaſures:&nbsp;thoſe who died of other diſeaſes, were ſent to the north&nbsp;or centre of the earth, and were under the dominion of&nbsp;the gods ot darkneſs. &quot; Tlie loldiers who died in&nbsp;battle, or in captivity among their enemies, and the&nbsp;women who died in labour, went to the houſe of the&nbsp;fun, who was confidered as the prince of glory. In his&nbsp;manſions they led a life of endleſs delight-. Every day&nbsp;the foldiers, on the firſt appearance of his rays, hailed&nbsp;his birth with rejoicings and with dancings, and the&nbsp;muſic of inſtruments and voices. At his meridian they&nbsp;met with the women, and in like feſtivity accompanied&nbsp;him to his ſetting. After four years of this glorious&nbsp;life, they went to animate clouds, and birds of beautiful feathers and of ſweet ſong.; but always at liberty to&nbsp;rile again, if they pleaſed, to heaven, or deſcend to the&nbsp;earth, to warble their ſongs, and to fuck flowers*.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thefe ſentiments of a future ſtate, conceived in a ſavage and a rude period, could not long prevail among an enlightened and civilized people, when the times of&nbsp;rapine and violence therefore began to ceaſe ; when fo-cieties regulated by certain laws began to be eſtabliſhed ; when martial prowefs was leſs requisite, and the&nbsp;qualities of the heart had begun to give an importance&nbsp;to the character, the future ſtate was alſo modelled on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">different plan. In the Æneid of virgil, an author&nbsp;of a highly cultivated mind, and of poliſhed manners,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font3">becomes a place of the moſt impartial and unerring&nbsp;Juſtice ; every one now receives a ſentence ſuited to the&nbsp;actions of his paſt life, and a god is made to preſide in&nbsp;judgment ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">who hears and judges each committed crime,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inquires into the manner, place, and time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The confciou<sup>,</sup>s wretch muſt all his acts reveal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Loth to confeſs, unable to conceal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the firſt moment of his vital breath,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the laſt hour of unrepenting death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ſpirſts of the dead no longer mingle toge-ther-as in the leſs enlightened period of Homer ·; the vicious are difmiffed to a place of torments, the virtuous ſent to regions of blifs : indifferent characters are confined to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">limbus *.; and thoſe who are too virtuous for&nbsp;hell, but too much polluted with the ſtains of vice to&nbsp;enter heaven without preparation, are for fome time detained- ijr a purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For there are various penances enjoin’d,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And ſome are hung to bleach upon the wind ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Same plung’d in waters, others purg’d in fires,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Till all the dregs are drain’d, and ruſt expires ;</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">Till nothing’s left of their habitual </span><span class="font1">ſtams,</span></h3><a name="caption2"></a><h2><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">But the pure ether of the foul remains.</span></h2><h2><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">⅜</span></h2><div>

<p><span class="font3">The bliſsful ſeats of happy fouls below,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stars of their own, and their own funs they know ♦ where patriots live, who, for their country’s good,&nbsp;-In fighting fields were prodigal of blood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Theſe good men are engaged in various amuſements, according to the taſte and genius of each. Qrpħeus is&nbsp;ſtill playing on his harp, and the warriors are ſtill de-lighted with their chariots, their hυrfes, and their arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The place of torment is at fome diſtaace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A gaping gulph, which to the centre lies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And twice as deep as earth is diſtant from the ſkies ; From hence are heard the groans of ghoſts, the pains&nbsp;Οί founding laſhes<sub>?</sub> and of dragging chains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here, thofe who brother’s better claim difown,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expel their parents, and uſurp the throne j Defraud their clients, and, to lucre fold,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sit brooding on unprofitable gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WI10 dare not give, and even refuſe to lend,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Hoſts of deſerters, who their honour fold,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And baſely broke their faith for bribes of gold ·:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All theſe within the dungeon’s depth remain, Defpairing pardon, and expecting pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fouls of babes, of unhappy lovers, and fome others, feem to be placed in a paradiſe of fools reading in a quarter diſtinct from Elylιan Tartarus and Purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is curious to obſerve, how much thefe ideas of a future ſtate differ from the vague and fimple conjec-tures of rude nations ; and yet from their ſimple and rude&nbsp;conjectures, we can eaſily trace the ſucceiſive changes&nbsp;in the writings of Homer, Plato, and virgil ; and may&nbsp;eaſily ſhow, that thofe laws which different nations have&nbsp;preſcribed for their dead, have always borne the ſtrong-eſt analogy to their ſtate of improvement, their ſyſtem&nbsp;•of opinions, and their moral attainments. Some na-tions, as thoſe of India, have fancied a number of hea-vens and hells, correſponding to fome of their principal&nbsp;ſhadea in virtue and vice ; and have ſilled each of theſe&nbsp;places refpectively with all the fceπes of happineſs and&nbsp;mifery, which friendſhip and hatred, admiration, coh-tempt, or rancour, could ſuggeſt, But haring already&nbsp;obſerved the progreſs of the human mind in forming the&nbsp;grand and leading ideas of a future ſtate, we mean&nbsp;not to deſcend to the modifications which may haye&nbsp;occurred tq particular nations, ſects, or individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The belief ot Chrilliaus respecting futurity demands our attention, as being founded on a different principle,&nbsp;namely, on expreſs revelations from heaven.
