The latter trade in gold, which they pick up in the ſtreams as it is waſhed down from the mountains ; for there are no mines in their country, neither is there any gold in Abyſſinia, excepting wliat is imported from this or ſome other country’. The Shangalla are the natural enemies of the inhabitants of Ras-el-Feel, and much blood has been ſhed in the various incurſions they have made upon one ano-ther ; thougſh of late thoſe of Ras-el-Feel, by the aſſiſt-ance of the emperors, have been enabled to keep the Shangalla at bay.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">RAS-Sem, a city of Tripoli in Barbary, concerning which a number of fables were told by the Tripoline ambaſſador, all of which were believed in England and other parts of Europe in the beginning of this century. (See </hi><hi rend="italic">PKTRinED-City).</hi>  Mr Bruce informs us, that it is ſituated about five days journey ſouth from Bengazi;-but has no water excepting one fountain, which has a diſagreeable taſte, and ſeems to be impregnated with -alum.
