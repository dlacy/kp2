                <p><label>ROCHESTER, JOHN WILMOT</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">2nd
                    Earl of</hi> (1647-1680), English poet and wit, was the son
                    of Henry Wilmot, 1st earl. The family was descended from Edward Wilmot of
                    Witney, Oxfordshire, whose son Charles <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 1570-c. 1644),
                    having served with distinction in Ireland during the rebellion at the beginning
                    of the 17th century, was president of Connaught from 1616 until his death. In
                    1621 he had been created an Irish peer as Viscount Wilmot of Athlone, and he was
                    succeeded by his only surviving son, Henry <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi>
                    1612-1658). Having fought against the Scots at Newburn and been imprisoned and

               <p>the House of Commons for plotting in the interests of the king in 1641, Henry
                    Wilmot served Charles I. well during the Civil War, being responsible for the
                    defeats of Sir William Waller at Roundway Down in July 1643 and at Cropredy
                    Bridge in June 1644. In 1643 he was created Baron Wilmot of Adderbury. Wilmot
                    was on bad terms with some of the king’s friends and advisers, including Prince
                    Rupert, and in 1644 he is reported to have said that Charles was afraid of peace
                    and to have advised his supercession by his son, the prince of Wales.
                    Consequently he was deprived of his command, and after a short imprisonment was
                    allowed to cross over to France. He was greatly trusted by Charles II., whose
                    defeat at Worcester and subsequent wanderings be shared, and during this king’s
                    exile he was one of his principal advisers, being created by him earl of
                    Rochester in 1652. In the interests of Charles he visited the emperor Ferdinand
                    III., the duke of Lorraine, and the elector of Brandenburg, and in March 1655 he
                    was in England, where he led a feeble attempt at a rising on Marston Moor, near
                    York; on its failure he fled the country.</p>               <p>Born at Ditchley in Oxfordshire on the 10th of April 1647, John Wilmot, who
                    succeeded bis father as 2nd earl in 1658, was educated at Wadham College,
                    Oxford, and in 1661, although he was only fourteen years of age, received the
                    degree of M.A. On leaving Oxford he travelled in France and Italy with a tutor
                    who encouraged his love of literature, and moreover advocated principles of
                    temperance which, however, bore little fruit. He returned in 1664, and at once
                    made his way to Charles II.’s court, where his youth, good looks and 'wit
                    assured him of a welcome. In 1665 he joined the fleet serving against the Dutch
                    as a volunteer, and in the following year distinguished himself by carrying a
                    message in an open boat under fire. This reputation for courage was afterwards
                    lost in private quarrels in which he seems to have shirked danger. He became
                    gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles II., and was the confidant of his various
                    exploits. According to Anthony Hamilton, banishment from court for lampooning
                    the king or his mistresses was with Rochester an almost annual occurrence, but
                    his disgrace was never of long duration. Charles seems to have found his company
                    too congenial to be long dispensed with, and Pepys says that all serious men
                    were disgusted by the complaisance with which he passed over Rochester’s
                    insolence <hi rend="italic">{Diary,</hi> 17th Feb. 1669). In order to restore
                    his rapidly vanishing fortune he became a suitor to Elizabeth Malet. In spite of
                    the king’s support of Rochester’s suit, Miss Malet refused to marry the earl,
                    who thereupon had her seized (1665) from her uncle’s coach. Rochester was
                    pursued, and Charles, who was very angry, sent him to the Tower. Miss Malet,
                    however, married him in 1667.</p>               <p>Not content with making or unmaking the reputation of the maids of honour and
                    the courtiers by his squibs and songs, Rochester aspired to be a patron of
                    poetry and an arbiter of taste, but he was vain and capricious, tolerating no
                    rivals in his capacity of patron. Dryden dedicated to him his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Marriage-a-la-Mode</hi> (1672) in a preface full of effusive flattery, at
                    the close of which, however, occurs a passage that may be taken to indicate that
                    he already had misgivings. “ Your lordship has but another step to make,” he
                    says, “ and from the patron of wit, you may become its tyrant; and oppress our
                    little reputations with more ease than you now protect them.” Dryden had another
                    patron in Lord Mulgrave (afterwards duke of Buckingham and Normandby), to whom
                    he dedicated (1675) <hi rend="italic">Aurcngzebe.</hi> Mulgrave had engaged in a
                    duel with Rochester, who had refused to fight at the last minute on the ground
                    of ill-health. Mulgrave allowed this story to spread, and Rochester, who
                    apparently thought him too dangerous an opponent, revenged himself on Dryden as
                    Mulgrave’s protégé by setting up as his rivals, first Elkanah Settle, and then
                    John Crowne. By his influence Settle’s <hi rend="italic">Emperor of Morocco</hi>
                    was played at Whitehall, and Crowne was employed, in direct infringement of
                    Dryden’s province as laureate, to write a masque for the court. Both these poets
                    were discarded in turn for Nathaniel Lee and Thomas Otway. In 1679 Mulgrave
                    began to circulate his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Satire</hi> in which Rochester
                    was singled out for severe criticism.</p>               <p>Rochester chose to pretend that this was Dryden’s work, not Mulgrave’s, and by
                    his orders a band of roughs set on the poet in Rose Alley, Covent Garden, and
                    beat him. He obviously felt no shame for this infamous attack, for in his “
                    Imitation of the First Satire of Juvenal ” he says, “ Who’d be a wit in Dryden’s
                    cudgelled skin?” His health was already undermined, and in the spring of 1680 he
                    retired to High Lodge, Woodstock Park. He began to show signs of a more serious
                    temper, and at his own request was visited (July 20th to July 24th) by Bishop
                    Burnet, who attested the sincerity of his repentance. He died, however, two days
                    after the bishop left him. When his son Charles, the 3rd earl, died on the 12th
                    of November 1681, his titles became extinct.</p>               <p>As a poet Rochester was a follower of Abraham Cowley and of Boileau, to both of
                    whom he was considerably indebted. His love lyrics are often happy, but his real
                    vigour and ability is best shown in his critical poems and satires. The
                    political satires are notable for their fierce exposure of Charles II.’s
                    weakness, his ingratitude, and the slavery in which he was held by his
                    mistresses. They show that Rochester had it in him to be a very different man
                    from the criticizing courtier and the “ very profane wit ” who figures in
                    contemporary memoirs.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.—</hi>
