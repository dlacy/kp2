<p><label>RICHMOND</label>
a city, port of entry, and the metropolis of Virginia, one of the United States of North America.</p><p>It is situated on the north bank of James River, just below <hi rend="sup"/> the falls, one hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of the <hi rend="sub"/> river, and one hundred and twenty-three south-west from Washington. The situation of tllis city is alike picturesque, salubrious, and favourable for commerce. The public buildings are numerous, and some considerable manufactures are here carried on. The capitol, a handsome structure, occupies a commanding situation on a rising ground. Among the churches, that called the Monumental Church is most beautiful and conspicuous. It is erected on the spot where, in 1811, the theatre of Richmond w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as burned to the ground during the performance, and above seventy persons perished in the flames. A monument in front commemorates the event, and hence the name of the church. There are a number of other religious houses, a sufficiency of good schools, and a well-regulated penitentiary. Richmond is the natural depot of tobacco, wheat, and hemp, raised in the populous county watered by the river. The falls extend six miles, during which space the James descends eighty feet. A canal passes around these falls, and the river is navigable for batteaux two hundred and twenty miles above them ; by this means the city is connected with a very extensive and productive back country. The inland, coasting, and foreign trade is extensive. Manchester, on the opposite side of the river, is connected with it by means of bridges. In 1830 the population amounted to 16,060 ; in 1839 it may be estimated at about 20,000. Long. 77. 21. W. Lat. 37. 32. N. (r. R. r.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richmond, a town of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Kingston, nine miles from London, on the right bank of the river Thames, over which is an elegant bridge leading to Twickenham. It was anciently called Sheen, and a palace adjoining was long the residence of our monarchs. The park still belongs to the crown. A hill rises from the town, of great celebrity for the extent and beauty of the prospect which it affords. The brow of the hill has a delightful promenade, and is adorned by residences of great taste and magnificence, and by hotels, where every accommodation that luxury can desire is supplied, though at the most extravagant prices. Other houses of the purest taste are built along the bank, and to the edge of the river. The vicinity to the royal gardens of Kew form an inducement to a residence at this delightful place, which is one of the desirable retreats from the metropolis. It has a neat parish church, or rather chapel to Kingston. The population amounted in 1801 to 4628, in 1811 to 5219, in 1821 to 5994, and in 1831 to 7243.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richmond, a market and borough town of the north riding of the county of York, 254 miles from London. It stands on the east side of a steep hill rising from the banks of the river Swale, which nearly encircles the town. It is finely situated, and well built. It was fortified in ancient times, and probably more populous than it is at present. It now gives the title of duke to one branch of the illegitimate descendants of Charles H. It returns two members to the House of Commons, and is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. The country around it is celebrated for its breed of horses, and annual races are still held near it. There is a good market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1821 to 3546, and in 1831 to 3900.</hi></p>
