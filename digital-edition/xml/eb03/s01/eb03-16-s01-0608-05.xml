Lat. 37. 32. — It was famous in antiquity for a battle between the Greek and Perſian fleets. In the council of war held among the Perſians on this occaſion, all the commanders were for engaging, becauſe they knew this advice to be moſt agreeable to the king’s inclinations. Queen Artemiſia was the only perſon who oppoſed this reſolution. She was queen of Halicarnaſſus; and followed Xerxes in this war with five ſhips, the beſt equipped of any in the fleet, except thoſe of the Sidonians. This princeſs diſtinguiſhed herſelf on all occaſions by her Angular courage, and ſtill more by her prudence and conduct. She repreſented, in the council of war we are ſpeaking of, the dangerous conſequences of engaging a people that were far more expert in maritime affairs than the Perſians; alleging, that the loſs of a battle at ſea would be attended with the ruin of their army; whereas, by ſpinning out the war, and advancing into the heart of Greece, they would create jealouſies and diviſions among their enemies, who would ſeparate from one another, in order to defend each of them their own country; and that the king might, almoſt without ſtriking a blow, make himſelf maſter of Greece. This advice, though very prudent, was not followed, but an engagement unanimouſly reſolved upon. Xerxes, in order to encourage his men by his preſence, cauſed a throne to be erected on the top of an eminence, whence he might ſafely behold whatever happened; having ſeveral ſcribes about him, to write down the names of fuch as ſhould ſignalize themſelves againſt the enemy. The approach of the Perſian fleet, with the news that a ſtrong detachment from the army was marching againſt Cleombrotus, who defended the iſthmus, ſtruck ſuch a terror into the Pe- loponneſians, that they could not by any intreaties be prevailed upon to ſtay any longer at Salamis. Being therefore determined to put to ſea, and ſail to the iſthmus, Themiſtocles privately diſpatched a truſty friend to the Perſian commanders, informing them of the intended flight; and exhorting them to ſend part of their fleet round the iſland, in order to prevent their eſcape. The fame meſſenger aſſured Xerxes, that Themiſtocles, who had ſent him that advice, deſigned to join the Perſians, as ſoon as the battle began, with all the Athenian ſhips. The king giving credit to all he ſaid, immediately cauſed a ſtrong ſquadron to ſail round the iſland in the night in order to cut off the enemy’s flight. Early next morning, as the Peloponneſians were preparing to ſet ſail, they found themſelves encompaſſed on all ſides by the Perſian fleet; and were againſt their will obliged to remain in the ſtraits of Salamis and expoſe themſelves to the ſame dangers with their allies. The Grecian fleet conſiſted of 380 ſail, that of the Perſians of 2000 and upwards. Themiſtocles avoided the engagement till a certain wind, which roſe regularly every day at the ſame time, and which was entirely contrary to the enemy, began to blow. As ſoon as he found himſelf favoured by this wind, he gave the ſignal for battle. The Perſians, knowing that they fought under their king’s eye, advanced with great reſolution; but the wind blowing directly in their faces, and the largeneſs and<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0615.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0609"/>
number of their ſhips embarraſſing them in a place ſo ſtrait and narrow, their courage ſoon abated; which the Greeks obſerving, uſed such efforts, that in a ſhort time breaking into the Perſian fleet, they entirely diſordered them; ſome flying towards Phalarus, where their army lay encamped; others ſaving themſelves in the harbours of the neighbouring iſlands. The Ionians were the firſt that betook themſelves to flight. But Queen Artemiſia diſtinguiſhed herſelf above all the reſt, her ſhips being the laſt that fled: which Xerxes obſerving, cried out that the men behaved like women, and the women with the courage and intrepidity of men. The Athenians were ſo incenſed againſt her, that they offered a reward of 1o, ooo drachmas to any one that ſhould take her alive: but ſhe, in ſpite of all their efforts, got clear of the ſhips that purſued her, and arrived ſafe on the coaſt of Aſia. In this engagement, which was one of the moſt memorable actions we find recorded in hiſtory, the Grecians loſt 40 ſhips; and the Persians 200, beſides a great many more that were taken, with all the men and ammunition they carried.</p><p>The iſland of Salamis is of a very irregular ſhape; it was reckoned 70 or 80 ſtadia, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> 8 or 10 miles long, reaching weſtward as far as the mountains called <hi rend="italic">Kerata.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Horns.</hi> Pauſanias informs us, that on one fide of this iſland flood in his time a temple of Diana, and on the other a trophy for a victory obtained by Themiſtocles, together with the temple of Cyehreus, the ſite of which is now thought to be occupied by the church of St Nicholas.</p><p>The city of Salamis was demoliſhed by the Athenians, becauſe in the war with Caſſander it ſurrendered to the Macedonians, from diſaffection. In the ſecond century, when it was viſited by Pauſanias, ſome ruins of the Agora or market-place remained, with a temple and image of Ajax; and not far from the port was ſhown a ſtone, on which, they related, Telamon ſat to view the Salaminian ſhips on their departure to join the Grecian fleet at Aulis. The walls may ſtill be traced, and it has been conjectured were about four miles in circumference. The level ſpace within them was now covered with green corn. The port is choked with mud, and was partly dry. Among the ſcattered marbles are ſome with inſcriptions. One is of great antiquity, before the introduction of the Ionic alphabet. On another, near the port, the name of Solon occurs. This renowned lawgiver was a native of Salamis, and a ſtatue of him was erected in the market-place, with one hand covered by his veſt, the modeſt attitude in which he was accuſtomed to addreſs the people of Athens. An inſcription on black marble was alſo copied in 1676 near the ruin of a temple, probably that of Ajax. The iſland of Salamis is now inhabited by a few Albanians, who till the ground. Their village is called <hi rend="italic">Ampelaki,</hi> the Vineyard, ” and is at a diſtance from the port, ſtanding more inland. In the church are marble fragments and ſome inſcriptions.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
