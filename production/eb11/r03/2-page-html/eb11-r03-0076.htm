<p><span class="font1">seal (1833-34), president of the Board of Trade (1841-43), and president of the India board (1843-46).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His son, the future marquess, began his political life as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">attaché</span><span class="font1"> to a special mission to Brussels in 1849. In 1851 he&nbsp;married Henrietta Vyner (d. 1907), and their eldest son, afterwards known as Earl de Grey, was born in 1852. Under his&nbsp;courtesy title of ViscountGoderich he was returned to the House&nbsp;of Commons for Hull in 1852 as an advanced Liberal. In 1853&nbsp;he was elected for Huddersfield, and in 1837 for the West&nbsp;Riding of Yorkshire. In January 1859 he succeeded to his&nbsp;father’s title, and in November of the same year to that of&nbsp;his uncle, Earl de Grey. A few months after entering the&nbsp;Upper House he was appointed under-secretary for war, and&nbsp;in February 1861 under-secretary for India. Upon the death&nbsp;of Sir George Cornewall Lewis in April 1863 he became secretary for war, with a seat in the cabinet. In 1866 he was appointed secretary of state for India. On the formation of the&nbsp;Gladstone administration in December 1868, Lord Ripon was&nbsp;appointed lord president of the council, and held that office&nbsp;until within a few months of the fall of the government in&nbsp;1873, when he resigned on purely private grounds. In 1869&nbsp;he was created a Knight of the Garter. In 1871 Lord Ripon&nbsp;was appointed chairman of the High Joint-Commission on the&nbsp;Alabama claims, which arranged the treaty of Washington.&nbsp;In recognition of his services he was elevated to a marquessate&nbsp;(1871). In 1874 he became a convert to Roman Catholicism,&nbsp;and this involved his resignation of the office of grand master&nbsp;of the English Freemasons. On the return of Gladstone to&nbsp;power in 1880 Lord Ripon was appointed viceroy of India,&nbsp;the appointment exciting a storm of controversy, the marquess&nbsp;being the first Roman Catholic to hold the viceregal office.&nbsp;He went out to reverse the Afghan policy of Lord Lytton,&nbsp;and Kandahar was given up, the whole of Afghanistan being&nbsp;secured to Abdur Rahman. The new viceroy was also called&nbsp;upon to decide grave questions between the native population&nbsp;and the resident British, and he resolved upon a liberal policy&nbsp;towards the former, among his measures being the repeal of&nbsp;the Vernacular Press Act, the extension of local government&nbsp;and the appointment of an Education Commission. He&nbsp;extended the rights of the natives, and in certain directions&nbsp;curtailed the privileges of Europeans. Several of the viceroy’s&nbsp;measures, notably the Ilbert Bill of 1883—so named after&nbsp;its author Sir Courtenay Ilbert—irritated the Anglo-Indian&nbsp;population, and it was fiercely assailed. The purpose of this&nbsp;bill was disclosed in the statement that “ the government of&nbsp;India had decided to settle the question of jurisdiction over&nbsp;European British subjects in such a way as to remove from&nbsp;the code, at once and completely, every judicial disqualification&nbsp;which is based merely on race distinctions,” in fact to subject&nbsp;Europeans in certain cases to trial by native magistrates.&nbsp;This announcement raised a storm of indignation among the&nbsp;European community in India, and the government were&nbsp;obliged virtually, though not avowedly, to abandon their&nbsp;measure. Act III. of 1884 was a compromise, which, while&nbsp;subjecting Europeans to the jurisdiction of native district magistrates or sessions judges, reserved to them the right to demand&nbsp;trial by a jury of which at least half should be Europeans.&nbsp;Thtire probably never was a viceroy so unpopular among&nbsp;Anglo-Indians or so popular with the natives. On Lord&nbsp;Ripon’s departure from India in November 1884 there were&nbsp;extraordinary manifestations in his favour on the part of the&nbsp;Hindu population of Bengal and Bombay, and more than&nbsp;a thousand addresses were presented to him. On his arrival&nbsp;in England the marquess delivered a number of vigorous&nbsp;speeches in defence of his adminstration. In 1886 he became&nbsp;first lord of the admiralty in the third Gladstone ministry;&nbsp;and on the return of the Liberals to power in 1892 he was&nbsp;appointed colonial secretary, which post he continued to hold&nbsp;until the resignation of the government in 1895. He was&nbsp;included in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s cabinet at the&nbsp;close of 1905 as lord privy seal, an office which he retained in&nbsp;1908 when Mr Asquith formed his new ministry, but which&nbsp;he resigned later in the same year. He died at his seat, Studley&nbsp;Royal, near Ripon, on the 9th of July 1909, when his only son,&nbsp;Earl de Grey, who has been treasurer of the queen’s household&nbsp;since 1901, became the 2nd marquess. For many years Lord&nbsp;Ripon was president of the Yorkshire College of Science at&nbsp;Leeds, and chairman of the West Riding County Council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIPON, a cathedral city and municipal borough in the Ripon parliamentary division of the West Riding of Yorkshire,&nbsp;England, 214 m. N.N.W. from London, on the North-Eastern&nbsp;railway. Pop. (1901) 8230. It is pleasantly situated at the&nbsp;confluence of the streams Laver and Skell with the river Ure,&nbsp;which is crossed by a fine bridge of nine arches. The streets are&nbsp;for the most part narrow and irregular, and, although most of&nbsp;the houses are comparatively modern, some of them retain the&nbsp;picturesque gables characteristic of earlier times. The cathedral,&nbsp;although not ranking among those of the first class, is celebrated for its fine proportions, and is of great interest from the&nbsp;various styles of architecture which it includes. Its entire&nbsp;length from E. to W. is 266 ft., the length of the transepts&nbsp;130 ft., and the width of the nave and aisles 87 ft. Besides a&nbsp;large square central tower, there are two western towers. The&nbsp;cathedral was founded on the ruins of St Wilfrid’s abbey about&nbsp;680, but of this Saxon building nothing now iemains except&nbsp;the crypt, called St Wilfrid’s Needle. The present building&nbsp;was begun by Archbishop Roger (1154-81), and to this Transition period belong the transepts and portions of the choir.&nbsp;The western front and towers, fine specimens of Early English,&nbsp;were probably the work of Walter de Grey, archbishop of York&nbsp;(d. 1255), and about the close of the century the eastern portion&nbsp;of the choir was rebuilt in the Decorated style. The nave,&nbsp;portions of the central tower, and two bays of the choir are&nbsp;Perpendicular, having been rebuilt towards the close of the 15th&nbsp;century. Earlier than the rest of the fabric (except the crypt)&nbsp;is part of the chapter-house and the vestry, adjoining the&nbsp;south side of the choir, and terminating eastward in an apse.&nbsp;This is pure Norman work, and there is a crypt of that period&nbsp;beneath, which was formerly filled with unburied bones. There&nbsp;are a number of monuments of historical and ' antiquarian&nbsp;interest. The diocese includes rather less than one-third of&nbsp;the parishes of Yorkshire, and also a small part of Lancashire.&nbsp;The bishop’s palace, a modern building in Tudor style* </span><span class="font0">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">situated in extensive grounds about a mile from the town. In&nbsp;the vicinity is the domain of Studley Royal, the seat of the&nbsp;marquess of Ripon, which contains the celebrated ruins of&nbsp;Fountains Abbey (ç.v.). The principal secular buildings are&nbsp;the town hall, the public rooms, and the mechanics’ institution&nbsp;(1894) where technical and other classes are held. There are&nbsp;several old charities, including the hospital of St John the&nbsp;Baptist, founded in 1109 but modernized; the hospital of&nbsp;St Anne, founded probably in the reign of Henry VI. by an&nbsp;unknown benefactor; and the hospital of St Mary Magdalene&nbsp;for women. This last was founded by Thurstan, archbishop of&nbsp;York (1114-41), as a secular community, one of the special&nbsp;duties of which was to minister to lepers. In the 13th century&nbsp;a master and chaplain took the place of the lay brethren, and&nbsp;in 1334 a chantrywas founded. The chapel remains, with its&nbsp;interesting Norman work, its low side-windows, said to have&nbsp;allowed the lepers to follow the services, and its pre-Rcformation&nbsp;altar of stone, a rare example. There is a considerable trade&nbsp;in varnish, and the saddle-trees and other leather goods produced here are in high repute. The borough is under a mayor,&nbsp;4 aldermen, and 12 councillors. Area, 1809 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ripon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(In Rhypum, Ad Ripam)</span><span class="font1"> owed its origin to the monastery founded in the 7th century. A certain king, Alchfrith, is said to Have given the site of the town to Eata, abbot of&nbsp;Melrose, to found a monastery, but before it was completed&nbsp;Eata was deposed for refusing to celebrate Easter according&nbsp;to the Roman usage, and St Wilfrid was appointed the first&nbsp;abbot. Another version of the story, however, says that the&nbsp;land was given to St Wilfrid, who himself built the monastery.&nbsp;Ripon is said to have been made a royal borough by Alfred&nbsp;the Great, and King Æthelstan, after his victory at Brunanbuih</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
