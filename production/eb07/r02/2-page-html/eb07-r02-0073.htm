<p><span class="font1">tinguished during the middle ages. All minstrels did not use the harp, and recite or compose romantic poetry ; but&nbsp;it cannot be denied that such was the occupation of the&nbsp;most eminent of the order. This Ritson has rather admitted than denied ; and the number of quotations which&nbsp;his industry has brought together, rendered such an admission inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Indeed, the slightest acquaintance with ancient romances of the metrical class, shows us that they were composed for&nbsp;the express purpose of being recited, or, more properly,&nbsp;chaunted to some simple tune or cadence for the amusement of a large audience. Our ancestors, as they were&nbsp;circumscribed in knowledge, were also more limited in conversational powers than their enlightened descendants ; and&nbsp;it seems probable, that in their public festivals, there was&nbsp;great advantage found in the presence of a minstrel who&nbsp;should recite some popular composition on their favourite&nbsp;subjects of love and war, to prevent those pauses of discourse&nbsp;which sometimes fall heavily on a company, even of the&nbsp;present accomplished age, and to supply an agreeable train&nbsp;of ideas to those guests who had few of their own. It is,&nbsp;therefore, almost constantly insinuated, that the romance&nbsp;was to be chaunted or recited to a large and festive society ;&nbsp;and in some part or other of the piece, generally at the&nbsp;opening, there is a request of attention on the part of the&nbsp;performer ; and hence, the perpetual “ Lythe and listen&nbsp;lordings free,” which in those, or equivalent words, forms&nbsp;the introduction to so many romances. As, for example,&nbsp;in the old poem of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guy and Colbrand,</span><span class="font1"> the minstrel speaks&nbsp;of his own occupation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When meat and drink is great plentye,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then lords and ladyes still will be,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And sit and solace lythe ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then it is time for ιnee to speake,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of kern knights and kempes greate,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such carping for to kytbe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chaucer, also, in his rhyme of Sir Thopas, assigns to the minstrels of his hero’s household the same duty of reciting&nbsp;romances of spiritual or secular heroes, for the good knight’s&nbsp;pastime while arming himself for battle :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; Do cum,” he sayd. “ my minestrales,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And jestours for to tellen tales</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Anon in min arming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of romaunces that ben reales,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of popes and of cardinales,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And eke of love-longing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not to multiply quotations, we will only add one of some importance, which must have escaped Ritson’s researches ;&nbsp;for his editorial integrity was such, as rendered him incapable of suppressing evidence on either side of the question.&nbsp;In the old romance or legend of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">True Thomas and the&nbsp;Queen of Elfland,</span><span class="font1"> Thomas the Rhymer, himself a minstrel,&nbsp;is gifted by the Queen of the Faery with the faculties of&nbsp;music and song. The answer of Thomas is not only conclusive as to the minstrel’s custom of recitation, but shows&nbsp;that it was esteemed the highest branch of his profession,&nbsp;and superior as such to mere instrumental music :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ To harp and carp Thomas wheresoever ye gon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thomas take the these with the”-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Harping,” he said, “ ken I non,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For tong is chefe of Mynstralse.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We, therefore, arrive at the legitimate conclusion, that although, under the general term minstrels, were comprehended many who probably entertained the public only with instrumental performances, with ribald tales, with jugglery,&nbsp;or farcical representations, yet one class amongst them, and&nbsp;that a numerous one, made poetical recitation their chief,&nbsp;if not their exclusive occupation. The memory of these&nbsp;men was, in the general case, the depository of the pieces&nbsp;which they recited ; and hence, although a number of their&nbsp;romances still survive, very many more have doubtless fallen&nbsp;into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That the minstrels were also the authors of many of these poems, and that they altered and enlarged others, is&nbsp;a matter which can scarcely be doubted, when it is proved&nbsp;that they were the ordinary reciters of them. It was as&nbsp;natural tor a minstrel to become a poet or composer of&nbsp;romances, as for a player to be a dramatic author, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> musician a composer of music. Whatever individual among a&nbsp;class, whose trade it was to recite poetry, felt the least degree&nbsp;of poetical enthusiasm in a profession so peculiarly calculated&nbsp;to inspire it, must, from that very impulse, have become an&nbsp;original author, or translator at least ; thus giving novelty&nbsp;to his recitations, and acquiring additional profit and fame.&nbsp;Bishop Percy, therefore, states the case fairly in the following passage : “ It can hardly be expected that we should&nbsp;be able to produce regular and unbroken annals of the minstrel art and its professors, or have sufficient information,&nbsp;whether every minstrel or bard composed himself, or only&nbsp;repeated, the songs he chaunted. Some probably did the&nbsp;one and some the other ; and it would have been wonderful indeed, if men, whose peculiar profession it was, and&nbsp;who devoted their time and talents to entertain their hearers with poetical compositions, were peculiarly deprived of&nbsp;all poetical genius themselves, and had been under a physical incapacity of composing those common popular rhymes,&nbsp;which were the usual subjects of their recitation.”@@<sup>2</sup> While,&nbsp;however, we acquiesce in the proposition, that the minstrels&nbsp;composed many, perhaps the greater part of the metrical&nbsp;romances which they sung, it is evident they were frequently&nbsp;assisted in the task by others who, though not belonging to&nbsp;this profession, were prompted by leisure and inclination to&nbsp;enter upon the literary or poetical department as amateurs.&nbsp;These very often belonged to the clerical profession, amongst&nbsp;whom relaxation of discipline, abundance of spare time, and&nbsp;impatience of the routine of ceremonious duties, often led&nbsp;individuals into worse occupations than the listening to or&nbsp;composing metrical romances. It was in vain that both&nbsp;the poems and the minstrels who recited them were, by&nbsp;statute, debarred from entering the more rigid monasteries.&nbsp;Both found their way frequently to the refectory, and were&nbsp;made more welcome than brethren of their own profession ; as we may learn from a memorable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gest,</span><span class="font1"> in which&nbsp;two poor travelling priests, who had been received into a&nbsp;monastery with acclamation, under the mistaken idea of their&nbsp;being minstrels, are turned out in disgrace, when it is discovered that they were indeed capable of furnishing spiritual instruction, but understood none of the entertaining&nbsp;arts with which the hospitality of their convent might have&nbsp;been repaid by itinerant bards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nay, besides a truant disposition to a forbidden task, many of the grave authors may have alleged, in their own&nbsp;defence, that the connexion between history and romance&nbsp;was not in their day entirely dissolved. Some eminent&nbsp;men exercised themselves in both kinds of composition ; as,&nbsp;for example, Maître Wace, canon of Caen, in Normandy,&nbsp;who, besides the metrical chronicle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Brut,</span><span class="font1"> containing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> Jamieson’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Popular ΒaUαds,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii. p. 27. </span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Another authority of ancient date, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font1"> of Bertrand Guesclin, distinctly attributes the most renowned romances to the composition of the minstrels by whom they were sung. As the passage will be afterwards more fully quoted, we must here only say, that after enumerating Arthur, Launcelot, Godfrey, Roland, and other champions, he sums up his account of them as being the heroes</span></p>
