But on the whole it seems beyond doubt that&nbsp;it was custom rather than statute that was the main factor&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> of the regal period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What went by the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boni mores,</span><span class="font1"> quite distinct from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus moribus constitutum,</span><span class="font1"> must also be regarded&nbsp;as one of the regulatives of public and private order.&nbsp;Part of what fell within their sphere might also be expressly regulated by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font1"> ; but there was much that&nbsp;was only gradually brought within the domain of these&nbsp;last, and even down to the end of the republic not a little&nbsp;that remained solely under the guardianship of the family&nbsp;tribunal or the censor’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regimen morum.</span><span class="font1"> Its function was&nbsp;twofold : sometimes it operated in restraint of law by condemning—though it could not prevent—the ruthless and&nbsp;unnecessary exercise of legal right, as, for example, that of&nbsp;the head of a house over his dependants ; and sometimes&nbsp;it operated supplementarily, by requiring observance of&nbsp;duties that could not be enforced by any compulsitor of&nbsp;law. Dutiful service, respect, and obedience from inferiors&nbsp;to superiors, chastity, and fidelity to engagements, express&nbsp;or implied </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jides),</span><span class="font1"> were among the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">officia</span><span class="font1"> that were thus&nbsp;inculcated, and whose neglect or contravention not only&nbsp;affected the reputation but often entailed punishments and&nbsp;disabilities, social, political, or religious.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Quiritian Family.—</span><span class="font1">The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font1"> in Roman law had at once a more extensive and a more limited&nbsp;meaning than it has in its English form.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Husband, wife,&nbsp;and children did not necessarily constitute an independent&nbsp;family among the Romans, nor were they all necessarily&nbsp;of the same one. Those formed a family who were all&nbsp;subject to the right or power—originally </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus,</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font1"> but&nbsp;latterly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus—</span><span class="font1">of the same family head </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(^paterfamilias).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">He might have a whole host dependent on him,—wife and&nbsp;sons and daughters, and daughters-in-law, and grandchildren by his sons, and possibly remoter descendants&nbsp;related through males ; so long as they remained subject&nbsp;to him they constituted but one family, that was split up&nbsp;only on his death or loss of citizenship. But if his wife&nbsp;had not passed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in mαnum—</span><span class="font1">and that was common enough&nbsp;even during the republic, and universal in the later empire&nbsp;—she did not become a member of his family : she remained a member of the family in which she was born,&nbsp;or, if its head was deceased or she had been emancipated,&nbsp;was the sole member of a family of her own. Both sons&nbsp;and daughters on emancipation ceased to be of the family&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> who had emancipated them. A&nbsp;daughter’s children could never under any circumstances&nbsp;be members of the family of their maternal grandfather ;&nbsp;for children born in lawful marriage followed the family&nbsp;of their father, while those who were illegitimate ranked&nbsp;from the moment of birth as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p&gt;atresfamilias</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">matres-familias.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font1">With the early Romans, as with the Hindus and the Greeks, marriage was a religious duty a man owed alike&nbsp;to his ancestors and to himself. Believing that the happiness of the dead in another world depended on their proper&nbsp;burial and on the periodical renewal by their descendants&nbsp;of prayers and feasts and offerings for the repose of their&nbsp;souls, it was incumbent upon him above all things to perpetuate his race and his family cult. In taking to himself a wife, he was about to detach her from her father’s&nbsp;house and make her a partner of his family mysteries.&nbsp;With the patrician at least this was to be done only with&nbsp;divine approval, ascertained by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia.</span><span class="font1"> His choice was&nbsp;limited to a woman with whom he had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coηubium (iπcγαpiα)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or right of intermarriage. This was a matter of state&nbsp;arrangement; and in the regal period Roman citizens&nbsp;could have it outside their own bounds only with members&nbsp;of .states with which they were in alliance, and with which&nbsp;they were connected by the bond of common religious&nbsp;observances. A patrician citizen, therefore, if his marriage&nbsp;was to be reckoned lawful </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ffustae nuptiae),</span><span class="font1"> had to wed&nbsp;either a fellow-patrician or a woman who was a member of&nbsp;an allied community. The ceremony was a religious one,&nbsp;conducted by the high priests of the state, in presence of&nbsp;ten witnesses, representatives probably of the ten curies of&nbsp;the bridegroom’s tribe, and was known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">confarreatio.</span><span class="font1"> Its&nbsp;effect was to dissociate the wife entirely from her father’s&nbsp;house and to make her a member of her husband’s ; for&nbsp;confarreate marriage involved what was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in maηum&nbsp;conventio,</span><span class="font1"> the passage of the wife into her husband’s&nbsp;“hand ” or power, provided he was himself </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">if he was not, then, though nominally in his hand, she was&nbsp;really subject like him to his family head. Any property&nbsp;she had of her own—which was a possible state of matters&nbsp;only if she had been independent before marriage—passed&nbsp;to him as a matter of course ; if she had none, her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> provided her a dowry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ffos),</span><span class="font1"> which shared the&nbsp;same fate. Whatever she acquired by her industry or&nbsp;otherwise while the marriage lasted also as a matter of&nbsp;course fell to her husband. In fact, so far as her patrimonial interests were concerned, she was in much the same&nbsp;position as her children ; and on her husband’s death she&nbsp;had a share with them in his inheritance as if she had&nbsp;been one of his daughters. In other respects </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">conferred more limited rights than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> ; for&nbsp;Romulus is said to have ordained that, if a man put away&nbsp;his wife except for adultery or one of two or three other&nbsp;very grave offences, he forfeited his estate half to her&nbsp;and half to Ceres, while if he sold her he was to be given&nbsp;over to the infernal gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> was the name given to the power exercised by a father, or by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> if he was&nbsp;himself </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate,</span><span class="font1"> over the issue of such </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">justœ nuptiae.</span></p>
