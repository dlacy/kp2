<p><span class="font1">Therefore let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> be the height of the weir from the bottom of the river, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font1"> the height of the water above the edge of the weir.

<p><span class="font1">very troublesome to solve this equation regularly, because the unknown quantity A is found in the second term of the&nbsp;answer. But we know that the height producing the velocity above the weir is very small in comparison of A and&nbsp;of α, and, if only estimated roughly, will make a very insensible change in the value of A ,∙ and, by repeating the&nbsp;operation, we can correct this value, and obtain A to any&nbsp;degree of exactness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To illustrate this by an example. Suppose a river, the section of whose stream is 150 feet, and that it discharges&nbsp;174 cubic feet of water in a second ; how much will the&nbsp;waters of this river be raised by a weir of the same width,&nbsp;and 3 feet high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Suppose the width to be 50 feet. This will give 3 feet for the depth ; and we see that the water will have a clear&nbsp;fall, because the lower stream will be the same as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The section being 150 feet, and the discharge 174, the mean velocity is ¼¼</span><span class="font0">⅙</span><span class="font1"> = 1∙16 feet = 14 inches nearly, which&nbsp;requires the height of ¼ of an inch very nearly. This may&nbsp;be taken for the second term of the value of A. Therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A = f-</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">D</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">∖</span><span class="font1"> ’— ί Now √2G is, in the present case,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">27∙03, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1"> is 600, and D is 174 X 1728 = 300672. Therefore A = 12*28 — 0*25 = 12*03 nearly. Correct this value by substituting a more accurate value of the second</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">V√¾(α + A√ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>e</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12*28 —0*25 = 12*03 for a more accurate value, differing from the former about ⅛ of an inch. It is needless to&nbsp;carry the approximation farther. Thus we see that a weir&nbsp;which dams up the whole of the former current of three feet&nbsp;deep, will only raise the waters of this river one foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same rule serves for showing how high we ought to raise this weir in order to produce </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">any given rise</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;waters, whether for the purposes of navigation, or for taking&nbsp;off a draft to drive mills, or for any other service ; for if&nbsp;the breadth of the river remain the same, the water will&nbsp;still flow over the weir with nearly the same depth. A&nbsp;very small and hardly perceptible difference will indeed&nbsp;arise from the diminution of slope occasioned by this rise,&nbsp;and a consequent diminution of the velocity with which the&nbsp;river approaches the weir. But this difference must always&nbsp;be a small fraction of the second term of our answer ; which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">term is itself very small ; and even this will be compensat; in some degree, by the freer fall which the water will ha&nbsp;over the weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the intended weir is not to have the whole breadth the river (which is seldom necessary even for the purpos&nbsp;of navigation), the waters will be raised higher by the saι&nbsp;height of the wasteboard. The calculation is precisely t&nbsp;same for this case. Only in the second term, which giι&nbsp;the head of water corresponding to the velocity of the riv&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1"> must still be taken for the whole breadth of the riv&nbsp;while in the first term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1"> is the length of the wasteboa&nbsp;Also √2G must be a little less, on account of the contn&nbsp;tions at the ends of the weir, unless these be avoided&nbsp;giving the masonry at the ends of the wasteboard a cure&nbsp;shape on the upper side of the wasteboard. This shoι&nbsp;not be done when the sole object of the weir is to ra&nbsp;the surface of the waters. Its effect is but trifling at a&nbsp;rate, when the length of the wasteboard is considerable,&nbsp;proportion to the thickness of the sheet of water flowi&nbsp;over it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It was found extremely difficult to measure tile ext height of the water in the upper stream above the wasι&nbsp;board. The curvature AI extended several feet up t&nbsp;stream. Indeed there must be something arbitrary in tl&nbsp;measurement, because the surface of the stream is not 1&nbsp;rizontal. The deviation should be taken, not from a ho&nbsp;zontal plane, but from the inclined surface of the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is plain that a river cannot be fitted for continued ι vigation by weirs. These occasion interruptions ; but&nbsp;few inches may sometimes be added to the waters of a riι&nbsp;by a bar, which may still allow a flat-bottomed lighter oι&nbsp;raft to pass over it. This is a very frequent practice&nbsp;Holland and Flanders ; and a very cheap and certain cc&nbsp;veyance of goods is there obtained by means of strea&nbsp;which we would think no better than boundary ditch&nbsp;and unfit for every purpose of this kind. By means of a I&nbsp;the water is kept up a very few inches, and the stream 1&nbsp;free course to the sea.

The lighterman makes his boat f'&nbsp;to a stake immediately above the bar, raises the lower b&nbsp;brings over his boat, again makes it fast, and, having h&nbsp;down the other bar again, proceeds on his journey. The&nbsp;contrivance answers the end of a lock at a very trifling e&nbsp;pense ; and though it does not admit of what we are accι&nbsp;tomed to call navigation, it gives a very sure conveyan</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;which would otherwise be impossible.
