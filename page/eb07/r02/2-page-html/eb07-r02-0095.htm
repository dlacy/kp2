<p><span class="font0">forehead ; the procession of St. Clare by torch-light, where the abbess is torn to pieces, once read are not easily forgotten. Lewis also avoided Mrs. Radcliffe’s error ; his&nbsp;ghosts are real, and his devil genuine, though, as is not uncommon, we believe, in practice, he takes the form of a&nbsp;woman, instead of appearing, as Defoe has it, “ in all his&nbsp;formalities and frightfuls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Montorio</span><span class="font0"> of Maturin was also a boyish production, which the writer affected at a more advanced period of life&nbsp;to despise. Yet it appears to us to exhibit more genius,&nbsp;mingled, no doubt, with a deep vein of extravagance and false&nbsp;taste, than his more elaborate attempts to picture real manners and passions in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Woman.</span><span class="font0"> There was originality even&nbsp;in the conception, hideous as it was, of the hero employing&nbsp;against the brother, who had deceived him, the agency of&nbsp;that brother’s own sons, whom he persuades to parricide, by&nbsp;working on their visionary fears and by the doctrines of fatalism ; and then, when the deed is done, discovering that the&nbsp;victims whom he had reasoned and persecuted into crime&nbsp;were his own children. And though Maturin's machinery in&nbsp;no respect differs from that of his brethren, though he labours&nbsp;to explain away in the close all that had appeared supernatural&nbsp;in the beginning, and of course with total wantof success, yet&nbsp;the impression left on the mind by the perusal of the work,&nbsp;in the three thickest volumes we believe that modern romance has to boast of, though gloomy and unsatisfactory’, is&nbsp;certainly that of an inventive genius in the author. Such&nbsp;was the effect it produced on Sir Walter Scott, who was the&nbsp;first to direct attention to it, by a criticism in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review</span><span class="font0"> for 1810. “ We have strolled,” says he in a lively introduction, “ through a variety of castles, each of which&nbsp;was regularly called II Castello ; met with many captains&nbsp;of condottieri ; heard various ejaculations of Santa Maria and&nbsp;Diabolo; read, by a decaying lamp, and in a tapestried chamber, dozens of legends as stupid as the main history ; examined such suites of deserted apartments as might set up&nbsp;a reasonable barrack, and saw as many glimmering lights as&nbsp;would make a respectable illumination. Amidst these flat&nbsp;imitations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castle of Udolpho,</span><span class="font0"> we lighted unexpectedly upon the work which is the subject of the present article, and in defiance of the very bad taste in which it is&nbsp;composed, we found ourselves unusually involved in the&nbsp;perusal, and at times impressed with no common degree of&nbsp;respect for the powers of the author.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the Zelucco of Dr. Moore, which appeared about 1785, we have already spoken at some length in our Biographical&nbsp;article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The influence of such works as Goethe’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sorrows of Werther,</span><span class="font0"> written seemingly with the view of reversing Pope’s maxim, and proving that whatever is is wrong, becomes very&nbsp;obvious in our literature of fiction towards the close of the&nbsp;eighteenth century. For, in truth, such speculations, embodied in an imaginative form, were found highly congenial to&nbsp;that spirit of restlesness and discontent with political institutions which was every where abroad, perplexing nations with&nbsp;fear of change, and leading men of genius to dress up moral&nbsp;paradoxes in the shape of narrative, and to employ their eloquence in attacking those principles of society which tend to&nbsp;make men happy, or which keep them so. This tendency&nbsp;appears sufficiently obvious in the novels of Bage, a sceptic&nbsp;in religion, and a latitudinarian in morals, whose crude&nbsp;theories, we think, might have been allowed to repose in that&nbsp;oblivion to which they had been consigned, without being&nbsp;revived in such a work as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novelist's Library.</span><span class="font0"> Their&nbsp;introduction at all into a work intended to embody only the&nbsp;classical works of fiction, seems unaccountable ; nor is the&nbsp;singularity diminished by the fact that his best work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herms-ρrong, or Man as he is not,</span><span class="font0"> is omitted, while three of inferior&nbsp;merit are re-published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the social and political theories of the time found an abler exponent in Godwin, whose first work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caleb</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Williams,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1794, in which, throwing aside the stimulus of the marvellous, he has trusted the effect of his&nbsp;tale entirely to a picture of the workings of the mind on&nbsp;two beings of very opposite natures, who are driven, by </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">species of fatal instinct, into the relative positions of persecutor and victim. Tbe doctrines of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Political Justice&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">furnished avowedly the primary source of the inspiration&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caleb Williams,</span><span class="font0"> intended, to use the words of tile preface, “ to furnish a general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism, by which man becomes the&nbsp;destroyer of man ;” that is to say, to shew that, under the&nbsp;maladministration of English law, liable to be perverted&nbsp;by influence and wealth, the chances are all in favour of&nbsp;the escape of the real criminal and the conviction of the&nbsp;innocent ; a proposition notoriously untrue, and which is&nbsp;not even advocated with much art or plausibility in the&nbsp;series of persecutions to which Williams is exposed. Fortunately, however, for the real merit and permanent popularity of this singular work, the political design soon&nbsp;merges in a higher and more legitimate interest. The&nbsp;genius of the author kindles as he proceeds, and out of a&nbsp;hard and republican background brings forth the bright&nbsp;and chivalrous vision of the aristocratic Falkland, a being&nbsp;of a loving noble nature, the victim of false honour and morbid refinement of feeling. Few scenes in romance exceed&nbsp;in breathless and entrancing interest the description of the&nbsp;progress of suspicion in the mind of Williams, till he extorts&nbsp;from his master the fatal secret, on which hangs the whole&nbsp;of his future fate ; the escape from prison in the grey dawn&nbsp;of a drizzling morning ; and the last interview between&nbsp;Williams and his dying persecutor, sitting, corpse-like, to&nbsp;hear his secret disclosed to the world, and to suffer the&nbsp;agony of knowing that life and reputation are about to leave&nbsp;him together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In none of his other works did Godwin evince the same grandeur of conception, and in none of his subsequent personations, except Bethlehem Gabor, did he exhibit that&nbsp;pow*er of presenting demoniacal characters, such as Tyrrell&nbsp;and Gines, in a light which renders them, unnatural as they&nbsp;are, actual objects of terror, like a serpent in the path. The&nbsp;tone of his next novel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">St. Leon,</span><span class="font0"> is altogether more subdued&nbsp;than that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caleb Williams.</span><span class="font0"> It has a mournful eloquence&nbsp;in harmony with the picture of desolation which it presents.&nbsp;Here, too, the author has imperfectly succeeded in working&nbsp;out the design which he announces he had in view ; namely, that of proving that the happiness of mankind w<sup>r</sup>ould not&nbsp;have been augmented by tile gifts of immortal youth and&nbsp;inexhaustible riches ; for, in order to illustrate his position,&nbsp;Godwin is under the necessity of laying the scene in a remote age, and making the persecutions of St. Leon arise from&nbsp;feelings of superstitious credulity, which we cannot help recollecting that the progress of intelligence has since exploded. The senior wrangler, who asked what </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">proved, would certainly therefore have been dissatisfied with&nbsp;Godwin’s demonstration ; but as the vehicle of a series of&nbsp;most touching and impressive scenes, his plot is farfrom deficient in interest, nor, granting its premises, in probability.&nbsp;“ How minute,” says an eloquent critic, “ how pathetic, how&nbsp;tragical is the detail of the gradual ruin which falls on this&nbsp;weak devoted man, up to its heart-breaking consummation in&nbsp;the death of the noble Marguerite de Damville ; how tremendous and perfect is the desolation, after voluntarily leaving his daughters, and cutting the last thread which binds&nbsp;him to his kind ! How complete is the description of his&nbsp;escape from the procession of the auto da fé ; of his entrance into the Jew’s house, his fears, his decaying strength,&nbsp;just serving to make up the life-restoring elixir, the dying&nbsp;taper, the insensibility, the resurrection to new life, and&nbsp;the day-spring of his young manhood ! How shall we speak&nbsp;of the old man, the bequeather of the fatal legacy to St.&nbsp;Leon, and his fearful words : ‘Friendless, friendless ! alone,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
