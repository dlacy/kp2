His worship was closely connected with that of the great mother Cybele and of Attis. His chief attribute as a chthonian god was a snake, the symbol of the yearly renovation of the life of nature. Demosthenes (<hi rend="italic">De corona,</hi> p. 313) mentions various ceremonies practised during the celebration of the mysteries of this deity. One of the most important was the passing of a golden snake under the clothes of the initiated across their bosom and its withdrawal from below—an old rite of adoption. From Val. Max. 1. 3, 2 it has been concluded that Sabazius was identified in ancient times with the Jewish Sabaoth (Zebaoth). Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Symp.</hi> iv. 6) maintains that the Jews worshipped Dionysus, and that the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius. Whether he was the same as Sozon, a marine deity of southern Asia Minor, is doubtful. Some explain the name as the “ beer god,” from an Illyrian word <hi rend="italic">sabaya,</hi> while others suggest a connexion with ΣαFo (god of “ health ”) or <hi rend="italic">σέβας.</hi> His image and name are often found on “votive hands,” a kind of tah*sman adorned with emblems, the nature of which is obscure. His ritual and mysteries (<hi rend="italic">Sacra Saυadia</hi>) gained a firm footing in Rome during the 2nd century a.d., although as early as 139 B.c. the first Jews who settled in the capital were expelled by virtue of a law which proscribed the propagation of the cult of Jupiter Sabazius.</p><p>See J.
