denotes an ecclesiaſtical ſuperior in ſeveral reformed churches where epiſcopacy is not admitted : particularly among the Lutherans in Germany, and the Calviniſts in ſome other places.</p><p>The ſuperintendant is ſimilar to a biſhop ; only his power is ſomewhat more reſtrained than that of our dioceſan biſhops. He is the chief paſtor, and has the direction of all the inferior paſtors within his diſtrict or dioceſe. In Germany they had formerly ſuperintendants general, who were ſuperior to the ordinary ſuperintendants. Theſe, in reality, were archbiſhops ; but the dignity is funk into diſuſe ; and at preſent none but the ſuperintendant of Wirtemberg aſſumes the quality of ſuperintendant general.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
