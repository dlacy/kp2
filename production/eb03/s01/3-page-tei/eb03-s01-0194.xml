In the ſame pompous manner he was conducted all the way to London, which he entered on a black courser. He was received in the capital with the greateſt ſolemnity by the lord mayor and other magiſtrates, the city-companies under arms  lining all the ſtreets through which he paſſed, the houſes loaded with ſpectators, who expreſſed a generous concern for his captivity. Being arrived at the Tower, he was delivered, by indenture likewiſe, to the cuſtody of the conſtable, the Lord John Darcy, on the 2d of January 1347.</p><p>Baliol now, encouraged by the misfortune of his rival, made an effort once more to eſtabliſh himſelf on the throne of Scotland; and before the end of the year reduced the castles of Hermitage and Roxburgh, the foreſt of Ettric, the Merſe, with the counties of Annandale, Teviotdale, and Tweeddale. The Scots continued faithful to the cauſe of their king, notwithſtanding his misfortune, and choſe the Steward for the guardian of the kingdom. He behaved with a prudence equal to the high ſtation he filled: nevertheleſs the progreſs of Baliol was ſo rapid, that it is ſcarcely probable he could have maintained his ground, had not Edward again conſented to a truce; which, however, ſeems to have been ill observed on the part of the Scots. In fact, though both Scots and Engliſh hiſtorians are filent as to particulars, we find, that about the end of the year 1348, all Scotland was recovered out of the hands of the Engliſh; excepting Berwick, Roxburgh, Hermitage, and Lanric, which was part of Baliol’s hereditary eſtate, and defended by him with an army. The Scots hiſtorians inform us, that the Engliſh, in revenge for the damages done to their country by the breach of the peace, proclaimed a tournament and other military exerciſes at Berwick, to which they invited the Scots; but in their way thither the latter fell into an ambuſcade, and were all cut in pieces.</p><p>The years 1349 and 1350 were remarkable only for a dreadful plague which invaded Scotland, after having ravaged the continent of Europe. According to Fordun, one-third of the people of Scotland periſhed at this time. The patient’s fleſh ſwelled exceedingly, and he died in two days illneſs; but the mortality chiefly affected the middling and lower ranks of people. The ſame dreadful calamity continued throughout the years 1351 and 1352; occaſioning a ceſſation of arms not only in Scotland, but throughout all Europe.</p><p>All this time King David remained a priſoner in England; for though ſeveral treaties had been propoſed, they had hitherto come to nothing, becauſe the Engliſh monarch inſiſted upon being indemnified for the ravages the Scots had committed in his territories. At laſt it was agreed, that the king of Scotland ſhould be immediately ſet at liberty, on paying 90,000 merks for his ranſom, by equal proportions, within the ſpace of nine years: That 10,000 merks, being the firſt proportion, ſhould be paid, at the feaſt of Candlemas next to come, the second at Candlemas 1357, and ſo on till complete payment ſhould be made of the whole: That, during the ſaid ſpace of nine years, there ſhould be a truce between the two kingdoms: That so Scots gentlemen, of the beſt families in the kingdom, ſhould remain in England as hoſtages and ſureties for the ſaid ſum; and that, if any part thereof was not paid at the preciſe time appointed, then David ſhould remain a priſoner in England till it was paid; or, if he was detained by anyjuſt cauſe, that the lord high ſteward, the Lord Douglas, John of the Iſles, and others of the higheſt rank, ſhould come and ſupply his place.</p><p>Theſe terms were rejected by the Scots nobility; and, in 1355, war was recommenced with England, at the inſtigation of France, who lent 40,000 crowns to Scotland as a ſupply for defraying the expences.</p><p>With this ſum the guardian, having raiſed an army, once more took the field; but not before the Engliſh had deſtroyed the Lothians and Douglaſdale. A battle was fought on Niſhit-moor: in which the Engliſh being drawn into an ambuſcade, were totally defeated. The next attempt of the Scots was againſt the town of Berwick, which they deſigned to ſurpriſe by an eſcalade. They met, however, with ſuch a vigorous reliſtance, that many perſons of diſtinction were killed. However, the attack proved ſucceſsful; but the acquisition was of no great importance, as the caſtle ſtill held out. Edward, in the mean time, hearing of the loſs of the town, hurried back from France to London. Here he ſtaid but three days, and marched northward to raiſe the siege. He reached Durham on the 23d of December 1355, where he appointed all his military tenants to meet him on the 1st of January 1356. On the 14th of the ſame month he arrived before Berwick, which was inſtantly retaken; but the Scots were allowed to depart for their own country. The reduction of this place produced an extraordinary effect: for Baliol now perceiving that Edward meant not to eſtabliſh him on the throne of Scotland, but to retain in his own poſſeſſion as many places of that country as he could, came at laſt to the reſolution of giving up to the king of England the whole of Scotland. This indeed was no more than a form, becauſe at that time he was not poſſeſſed of the kingdom. However, the ceremony was performed at Roxburgh; and Baliol preſented his crown and ſome earth and ſtones by way of inveſtiture. Baliol in return was to have a revenue of 2000 pounds a- year; and as Edward was at the head of an excellent army, he had little doubt of being able to force the Scots to submit.</p><p>The affairs of Scotland were now in a very critical ſituation; and it was neceſſary to gain time. For this reaſon, Edward was amuſed with a negociation; and to this he the more willingly liſtened, as he was at that time waiting for his fleet, from which he had great expectations. A little time, however, diſcovered the deceit. The Scots plainly told Edward, that they would die rather than ſubmit to his demands ; and he, in return, threatened a most dreadful revenge. His fleet in the mean time arrived in the Frith of Forth ; the mariners deſtroyed and pillaged all that was within their reach, without ſparing even the ſacred edifices, carrying off the ſtatues of the blessed virgin, loading the monks with chains, and committing every thing in thoſe days called impiety and ſacrilege. Edward had by this time marched as far as Haddington, but was obliged to receive proviſions all the way from his fleet; for the Scots had deſolated the country through which he passed. During his march his army was haraſſed, and</p></body></text></TEI>
