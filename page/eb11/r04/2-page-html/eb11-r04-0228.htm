<p><span class="font3">The first campaign, or rather episode, of these wars @@<sup>1</sup> began with an armed demand of the Yorkist lords for the dismissal&nbsp;of the Lancastrian element in the king’s council, Henry VI.&nbsp;himself being incapable of governing. The Lancastrians, and&nbsp;the king with them, marched out of London to meet them, and&nbsp;the two small armies (3000 Yorkists, 2000 Lancastrians) met at&nbsp;St Albans (May 22, 1455). The encounter ended with the&nbsp;dispersion of the weaker force, and the king fell into the hands&nbsp;of the Yorkists. Four years passed before the next important&nbsp;battle, Blore Heath, was fought (Sept. 23, 1459)· I<sup>n</sup> this the&nbsp;earl of Salisbury trapped a Lancastrian army in unfavourable&nbsp;ground near Alarket Drayton, and destroyed it; but new political&nbsp;combinations rendered the Yoikist victory useless and sent&nbsp;the leaders of the party into exile. They made a fresh attempt&nbsp;in 1460, and, thanks partly to treason in the Lancastrian camp,&nbsp;partly to the generalship of Warwick, won an important success&nbsp;and for the second time seized the king at Northampton (July&nbsp;10, 1460). Shortly afterwards, after a period of negotiation&nbsp;and threats, there was a fresh conflict. </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Richard</span><span class="font3"> duke of York&nbsp;went north to fight the hostile army which gathered at York&nbsp;and consisted of Lancashire and Midland Royalists, while his&nbsp;son Edward, earl of March, went into the west. The father was&nbsp;ambushed and killed at Wakefield (Dec. 30, 1460), and the&nbsp;Lancastrians, inspired as always by Queen Margaret of Anjou,&nbsp;moved south on London, defeated Warwick at St Albans (Feb.&nbsp;17, 1461), and regained possession of the king’s person. But&nbsp;the young earl of M</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">arc</span><span class="font3">h, now duke of York, having raised an&nbsp;army in the west,&quot;defeated the earl of Pembroke (Feb. 2, 1461)&nbsp;at Mortimer’s Cross (5 m. W. of Leominster). This was the&nbsp;first battle of the war which was characterized by the massacre&nbsp;of the common folk and beheading of the captive gentlemen—&nbsp;invariable accompaniments of Edward’s victories, and conspicuously absent in Warwick’s. Edward then pressed on,&nbsp;joined Warwick, and entered London, the army of Margaret&nbsp;retreating before them. The excesses of the northern Lancastrians in their advance produced bitter fruit on the retreat,&nbsp;for men flocked to Edward’s standard. Alarching north in&nbsp;pursuit, the Yorkists brought their enerriy to bay at Towtbn&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf,</span><span class="font3"> 3 m. S. of Tadcaster, and utterly destroyed them (March&nbsp;29, 1461). For three years after Towton the war consisted&nbsp;merely of desultory local struggles of small bodies of Lancastrians&nbsp;against the inevitable. The duke of York had become King&nbsp;Edward IV., and.had established himself firmly. But in 1464,&nbsp;in the far north of England, the Red Rose was again in the&nbsp;field. Edward acted with his usual decision. His lieutenant&nbsp;Montagu (Warwick’s brother) defeated and slew Sir Ralph&nbsp;Percy at Hedgley Aloor, near Wooler (April 25, 1464), and immediately afterwards destroyed another Lancastrian army,&nbsp;with which were both Henry VI. and Queen Margaret, at&nbsp;Hexham (Alay 8, 1464).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massacres and executions</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>@@@1</sup> The name, as is well known, comes from the “ white rose of York ” and the “ red rose of Lancaster ” ; but these badges, though more or&nbsp;less recognized as party distinctions, by no means superseded the&nbsp;private devices of the various great lords, such as the “falcon and&nbsp;fetterlock ” of Richard duke of York, the “ rose in sun ’’ of Edward&nbsp;IV., the “ crowned swan ” of Margaret, the Vere star, and even the&nbsp;revived “ white hart ” of Richard II.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">he advanced south, a few Yorkist nobles with their following rallied to him, but it was far more the disunion of the Warwick&nbsp;and the real Lancastrian parties than his own strength which&nbsp;enabled him to meet Warwick’s forces in a pitched battle. At&nbsp;Bamet, on Easter Eve, April 14, 1471, the decisive engagement&nbsp;was fought. But in the midst of the battle reinforcements&nbsp;coming up under the earl of Oxford to join Warwick came into&nbsp;conflict with their own party, the badge of the Vere star being&nbsp;mistaken for Edward’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rose-en-soleil.</span><span class="font3"> From that point all the&nbsp;mutually distrustful elements of Warwick’s army fell apart,&nbsp;and Warwick himself, with his brother Montagu, was slain.&nbsp;For the last time the unhappy Henry VI. fell into the hands&nbsp;of his enemies. He was relegated to the Tower, and Edward,&nbsp;disbanding his army, reoccupied the throne. But Alargaret&nbsp;of Anjou, his untiring opponent, who had been in France while&nbsp;her cause and Warwick’s was being lost, had landed in the west&nbsp;shortly after Barnet, and Edward had to take the field at once.&nbsp;Assembling a fresh army at Windsor, whence he could march&nbsp;to interpose between AIargaret and her north Welsh allies, or&nbsp;directly bar her road to London, he marched into the west on&nbsp;the 24th of April. On the 29th he was at Ciiencester, AIargaret,&nbsp;engaged chiefly in recruiting an army, near Bath. Edw’ard&nbsp;hurried on, but Margaret eluded him and marched for Gloucester. ·&nbsp;At that place the governor refused the Lancastrians admittance,&nbsp;and seeking to cross the Severn out of reach of the Yorkists,&nbsp;they pushed on by forced marches to Tewkesbury. But&nbsp;Edward too knew how to march, and caught them up. The&nbsp;battle of Tewkesbury (May 4,1471) ended with the destruction of&nbsp;Margaret’s force, the captivity of Alargaret, the death of her son&nbsp;Edward (who, it is sometimes said, was stabbed by Edward IV.&nbsp;himself after the battle) and the execution of sixteen of the&nbsp;principal Lancastrians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This was Edward’s last battle. The rest of his eventful reign was similar in many ways to that of his contemporary&nbsp;Louis XI., being devoted to the consolidation of his power,&nbsp;by fair means and foul, at the expense of the great feudatories.&nbsp;But the Wars of the Roses were not yet at an end. For fourteen&nbsp;years, except for local outbreaks, the land had peace, and&nbsp;then kichard III.’s crown, struck from his head on Bosworth&nbsp;Field (Aug. 22, 1485), was presented to Henry earl of Richmond, who, as Henry VII., established the kingship on a secure&nbsp;foundation. A last feeble attempt to renew the war, made by&nbsp;an army gathered to uphold the pretender Lambert Simnel,&nbsp;was crushed by Henry VII. at Stoke Field (4 m. S.W. of&nbsp;Newark) on the 16th of June 1487.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROSETTA (Coptic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rashit,</span><span class="font3"> Arabic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">RashlA), a.</span><span class="font3"> town situated at the western or “ Rosetta ” mouth of the Nile on the west&nbsp;bank. It was called Bolbitine by the Greeks, but according&nbsp;to Herodotus the Bolbitine mouth was artificial, and it was&nbsp;evidently of little importance compared with the Canopic,&nbsp;Sebennytic and Pelusiac mouths. AVhen the other branches&nbsp;and the Alexandria canal silted up, Rosetta prospered like its&nbsp;sister port of Damietta on the eastern branch; the main trade&nbsp;of the overland route to India passed through it until Alehemet&nbsp;Ali cut a new canal joining Alexandria to the Nile. Rosetta&nbsp;is now much decayed. Its population in 1907 was 16,810,&nbsp;almost entirely Mussulman. A railway joins it to Alexandria.&nbsp;The celebrated Rosetta Stone which supplied Champollion&nbsp;with the key for the decipherment of the ancient monuments&nbsp;of Egypt </span><span class="font2">was </span><span class="font3">found near Fort St Julien, 4 m. N. of the town,&nbsp;in 1799, by Boussard, a French officer. It is a basalt stele&nbsp;inscribed in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek with a decree&nbsp;of the priests assembled at Alemphis in favour of Ptolemy V.&nbsp;Epiphanes. It was ceded to the English at the capitulation&nbsp;of Alexandria (1801) and is now in the British Aluseum.
