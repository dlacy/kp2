in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> the ratio of 3 : 2 in the numerical calculation of musical intervals. This, and many other old pedantic terms, such as <hi rend="italic">super-particular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">super- partient,</hi> &amp;c., employed to express ratios very simple, and easily intelligible under other terms, had better be abandoned entirely in musical nomenclature, which has long been overloaded with such jargon.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sesqui-alterate,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Geometry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic,</hi> is a ratio between two lines, two numbers, or the like, where one of them contains the other once, with the addition of a half.</p><p>Thus 6 and 9 are in a sesqui-alterate ratio, since 9 contains 6 once, and 3, which is half of 6, over ; and 20 and 30 are in the same, as 30 contains 20 and half 20, or 10.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sesqui-Duplicate</hi> <hi rend="italic">Ratio</hi> is when of two terms the greater contains the less twice, and half the less remains ; as 15 and 6, 50 and 20.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sesqui-Tertional</hi> <hi rend="italic">Proportion</hi> is when any number or quantity contains another once and one third.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
