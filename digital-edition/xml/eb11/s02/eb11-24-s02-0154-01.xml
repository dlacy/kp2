He learnt the elements of his profession from his father Giovanni and his uncle Bartolommeo, who both practised as architects at Verona with much success. He went at an early age to Rome to study classic sculpture and architecture. Among his earliest works are the duomo of Montefiascone (an octagonal building surmounted with a cupola), the church of San Domenico at Orvieto, and several palaces at both places. He also executed a fine tomb in S. Domenico. He was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was much employed by the signoria of Venice, not only at home, but also in strengthening the fortifications of Corfu, Cyprus and Candia. One of Sanmichele’s most graceful designs is the Cappella de’ Peregrini in the church of S. Bernardino at Verona—square outside and circular within, of the Corinthian order. He built a great number of fine palaces at Verona, including those of Canossa, Bevilacqua and Pompei, as well as the graceful Ponte Nuovo. In 1527 Sanmichele began to transform the fortifications of Verona according to the newer system of corner bastions—a system for the advancement of which he did much valuable service. His last work, begun in 1559, was the round church of the Madonna di Campagna, 1½ m. from Verona on the road to Venice. Like most other distinguished architects of his time he wrote a work on classic architecture, <hi rend="italic">I Cinque Ordini dell' architettura,</hi> printed at Verona in 1735.</p><p>See Ronzani and Luciolli, <hi rend="italic">Fabbriche . . . di</hi> <hi rend="italic">M.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Sanmichele</hi> (Venice. 1832) ; and Selva, <hi rend="italic">Εlogio di Sanmichele</hi> (Rome, 1814).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
