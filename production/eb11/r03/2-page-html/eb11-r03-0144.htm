<p><span class="font1">ROBINS, BENJAMIN (1707-1751), English man of science and engineer, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were&nbsp;Quakers in poor circumstances, and gave him very little education. Having come to London by the advice of Dr Henry&nbsp;Pemberton (1694-1771), who had recognized his talents, he&nbsp;for a time'maintained himself by 'teaching mathematics, but&nbsp;soon devoted himself to engineering and the study of fortification. In particular he carried out an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, embodying his results in his famous&nbsp;treatise on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New Principles in Gunnery</span><span class="font1"> (1742), which contains&nbsp;a description of his ballistic pendulum (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chronograph).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Robins also made a number of important experiments on the&nbsp;resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles, and on the&nbsp;force of gunpowder, with computation of the velocities thereby&nbsp;communicated to projectiles. He compared the results of his&nbsp;theory with experimental determinations of the ranges of&nbsp;mortars and cannon, and gave practical maxims for the management of artillery. He also made observations on the flight of&nbsp;rockets, and wrote on the advantages of rifled barrels. His&nbsp;work on gunnery was translated into German by L. Euler,&nbsp;who added to it a critical commentary of his own. Of less&nbsp;interest nowadays are Robins’s more purely mathematical&nbsp;writings, such as his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Ncwton'S Methods of Fluxions and of Prime&nbsp;and Ultimate Ratios</span><span class="font1"> (1735), “A Demonstration of the Eleventh&nbsp;Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton’s Treatise of Quadratures ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Phil. Trans.,</span><span class="font1"> 1727), and similar works. Besides his scientific&nbsp;lahours Robins took an active part in politics. He wrote&nbsp;pamphlets in support of the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole,&nbsp;and was secretary of a committee appointed by the House of&nbsp;Commons to inquire into the conduct of that minister. He&nbsp;also wrote a preface to the- </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Report on the Proceedings of the&nbsp;Board of General Officers on their Examination into the Condtiet&nbsp;of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope,</span><span class="font1"> in which he gave an apology&nbsp;for the battle of Prestonpans. In 1749 he was appointed&nbsp;engineer-general to the East India Company, and went out to&nbsp;superintend the reconstruction of their forts; but his health&nbsp;soon failed, and he died at Fort St David on the 29th of July</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, EDWARD (1794-1863), American Biblical scholar, was born in Southington, Connecticut, on the 10th&nbsp;of April 1794, the son of William Robinson (1754-1825),&nbsp;minister of the Congregational Church of Southington. He&nbsp;graduated in 1816 at Hamilton College. In 1821 he came&nbsp;under the influence and teaching of AIoses Stuart, the second&nbsp;edition of whose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hebrew Grammar</span><span class="font1"> he helped to prepare for&nbsp;the press in 1823, and through whom he was appointed in&nbsp;the same year instructor in Hebrew in Andover Seminary.&nbsp;With Stuart he translated in 1825 the first edition of Winer’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grammar of New Testament Greek,</span><span class="font1"> and alone he translated&nbsp;Wahl’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clavis Philologica Novi Tcstamenti</span><span class="font1"> (1825). In 1826-30&nbsp;he studied in .Germany, especially at Halle, under Gesenius,&nbsp;Tholuck and Rodiger, and at Berlin, under Neander. He&nbsp;was professor (extraordinary) of sacred literature and Iihrarian&nbsp;at Andover in 1830-33, resigning because of dangerous epileptic&nbsp;attacks’, and in 1831-35 he edited the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Repository,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which he founded and carried on very largely by his own contributions, assisted somewhat by his young German wife,&nbsp;Theresa Albertina Luise (1797-1869), the daughter of Professor&nbsp;Ludwig Heinrich von Jakob of Halle, a linguist of considerable&nbsp;ability, and a writer (in her early years under the pseudonym&nbsp;“ Talvi ”) of essays and stories. In 1837 he accepted the&nbsp;professorship of Biblical literature in Union Theological Seminary,&nbsp;and left America for three years of study in Palestine and&nbsp;Germany, the fruit of which, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Researches,</span><span class="font1"> published&nbsp;in 1841, brought him the gold medal of the Royal Geographical&nbsp;Society in 1842. A second volume of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Researches</span><span class="font1"> appeared in&nbsp;1856. His plans to sum up his important topographical studies&nbsp;in a work on Biblical geography were cut short by cataract in&nbsp;1861 and by his death in New York City on the 27th of January&nbsp;1863. A great Biblical scholar and exegete, Robiqson must&nbsp;be considered the pioneer and father of Biblical geography—&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Researches,</span><span class="font1"> supplemented by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Geography&nbsp;ofthe Holy Land</span><span class="font1"> (1865), were based on careful personal exploration and tempered by a thoroughly critical spirit, which&nbsp;was possibly at times too sceptical of local tradition. Of&nbsp;scarcely less value in their day were his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Harmony of the&nbsp;Gospels</span><span class="font1"> (1845 and often) and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek and English Lexicon of&nbsp;the New Testament</span><span class="font1"> (1836; revised 1847 and 1850). He established in 1843 and edited for some years the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotheca Sacra&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(in which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Repository</span><span class="font1"> was merged in 1852), for which&nbsp;he wrote until 1855.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, HENRY CRABB (1777-1867), English journalist and diarist, the son of a tanner, was born at Bury St Edmunds&nbsp;on the 13th of March 1775. In 1796 he entered the office of a&nbsp;solicitor in London, but two years later, having inherited a sum&nbsp;of money sufficient to give him a small yearly income, he started&nbsp;in 1800 upon a tour on the Continent, travelling chiefly in&nbsp;Germany and Bohemia. In 1802 he became a student at the&nbsp;university of Jena, where he remained until his return to&nbsp;England in 1805. After vain endeavours to obtain a post in&nbsp;the diplomatic service, he was appointed foreign correspondent&nbsp;for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span><span class="font1"> at Altona. His letters, “ From the Banks of&nbsp;the Elbe,” were published in this newspaper during 1807, and&nbsp;on his return he became its foreign editor. In 1808 at the&nbsp;outbreak of the Peninsular War he was sent out as special war&nbsp;correspondent—an innovation in English journalism—for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Times</span><span class="font1"> to Spain. There he witnessed Sir John Moore’s retreat&nbsp;at Corunna. After his return to England he read for the bar&nbsp;at the Middle Temple, and from 1813 to 1828 he practised as&nbsp;a barrister, retiring as soon as he had acquired a modest competence. He is remembered chiefly as the friend of Lamb,&nbsp;Coleridge, Wordsworth and Southey. He was a great conversationalist, and his breakfast parties rivalled those of Samuel&nbsp;Rogers. He died in London on the 5th of February 1867.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span><span class="font1"> of 35 volumes, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journals</span><span class="font1"> of 30 volumes, and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters and Reminiscences</span><span class="font1"> in 36 volumes, contain vivid pictures&nbsp;drawn by an acute and sympathetic observer who had exceptional&nbsp;opportunities of studying contemporary celebrities. They are&nbsp;preserved at Dr Williams’s Library in Gordon Square, London.&nbsp;Crabb Robinson seems to have intended to edit these for publication, but exéept for a meagre selection edited by Thomas Sadler and&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence of II. Crabb&nbsp;Robinson</span><span class="font1"> (1869), they have never been reprinted. Crabb Robinson&nbsp;was one of the founders of the Athenaeum Club and of University&nbsp;College, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, JOHN (1650-1723), English diplomatist and prelate, a son of John Robinson (d. 1651), was born at Cleasby,&nbsp;near Darlington, on the 7th of November 1650. Educated at&nbsp;Brasenose College, Oxford, he became a fellow of Oriel College,&nbsp;and about 1680 chaplain to the British embassy to Stockholm,&nbsp;and remained in Sweden for nearly thirty years. During the&nbsp;absence of the minister, Philip Warwick, Robinson acted as&nbsp;resident and as envoy extraordinary, and he was thus in Sweden&nbsp;during a very interesting and important period, and was performing diplomatic duties at a time when the affairs of northern&nbsp;Europe were attracting an unusual amount of attention.&nbsp;Among his adventures not the least noteworthy was his journey&nbsp;to Narva with Charles XIL in 1700. In 1709 Robinson returned&nbsp;to England, and was appointed dean of Windsor and of Wolverhampton; in 1710 he was elected bishop of Bristol, and among&nbsp;other ecclesiastical positions he held that of dean of the Chapel&nbsp;Royal. In August 1711 he became lord privy seal, this being,&nbsp;says Lord Stanhope, “ the last time that a bishop has been&nbsp;called upon to fill a political office.” In 1712 the bishop represented England at the important congress of Utrecht, and&nbsp;at first plenipotentiary he signed the treaty of Utrecht in April&nbsp;1713. Just after his return to England he was chosen bishop&nbsp;of London in succession to Henry Compton. He died at Hampstead on the nth of April 1723, having been a great benefactor&nbsp;to Oriel College. Robinson wrote an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Account of Sweden:</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
