a well-known meteor, formed by the freezing of the vapour of water in the atmosphere. It differs from hail and hoar-frost, in being as it were crystallized, which they are not. This appears in examining a flake of snow by a magnifying glass ; when the whole of it will appear to be composed of fine shining spicula diverging like rays from a centre. As the flakes fall down through the atmosphere, they are continually joined by more of those radiated spi</p><p>cula, and thus increase in bulk like the drops of rain or hailstones. Dr. Grew, in a discourse of the nature of snow, observes, that many parts thereof are of a regular figure, for the most part stars of six points, and are as perfect and transparent ice as any we see on a pond. Upon each of these points are other collateral points, set at the same an- gles as the main points themselves ; among which there are divers other irregular, which are chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others also, by various winds, seem to have been thawed and frozen again into irregular clusters, so that it seems as if the whole body of snow were an infinite mass of icicles irregularly figured ; that is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into drops, the said drops forthwith descend ; upon which descent, meet- ing with a freezing air as they pass through a colder region, each drop is immediately frozen into an icicle, shooting it- self forth into several (points ; but these still continuing their descent, and meeting with some intermitting gales of warmer air, or in their continual waftage to and 1fo, touch- ing upon each other, some of them are a little thawed, blunted, and again frozen into clusters, or entangled so as to fall down in what we call flakes.</p><p>The lightness of snow, although it is firm ice, is ow- ing to the excess of its surface, in comparison to the matter contained under it ; as gold itself may be extended in surface till it ride upon the least breath of air.</p><p>The whiteness of snow is owing to the small particles in- to which it is divided ; for ice, when pounded, will become equally white. An artificial snow has been made by the following experiment. A tall phial of aquafortis being placed by the fire till it is warm, and filings of pure silver, a few at a time, being put into it, after a brisk ebullition, the silver will dissolve slowly. The phial being then placed in a cold window, as it cools, the silver particles will shoot into crystals, several of which running together, will form a flake of snow, which will descend to the bottom of the phial. While they are descending, they represent perfectly a shower of silver snow, and the flakes will lie upon one another at the bottom, like real snow upon the ground.</p><p>According to Signor Beccaria, clouds of snow differ in nothing from clouds of rain, but in the circumstance of cold that freezes them. Both the regular diffiÎ¹sion of the snow, and the regularity of the structure of its parts, particularly some figures of snow or hail which fall about Turin, show that clouds of snow are acted upon by some uniform cause like electricity ; and he endeavours to show how electricity is capable of forming these figures. He was confirmed in his conjectures by perceiving, that his apparatus for observ- ing the electricity of the atmosphere never failed to be electrified by snow as well as rain. Professor Winthrop sometimes found his apparatus electrified by snow when driven about by the wind, though it had not been affected by it when the snow itself was falling. A more intense electricity, according to Beccaria, unites the particles of hail more closely than the more moderate electricity does those of snow, in the same manner as we see that the drops of rain which fall from thunder-clouds are larger than those which fall from others, though the former descend through a less space.</p><p>But we are not to consider snow merely as a curious and beautiful phenomenon. The Great Dispenser of universal bounty has so ordered it, that it is eminently subservient, as well as all the works of creation, to his benevolent designs. Were we to judge from appearances only, we might imagine, that so far from being useful to the earth, the cold humidity of snow would be detrimental to vegetation. But the experience of all ages asserts the contrary. Snow, par- ticularly in those northern regions where the ground is covered with it for several months, fructifies the earth, by guarding the corn or other vegetables from the intenser cold of the air, and especially from the cold piercing winds.<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0499.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s03-0432"/>
Snow or ice water is always deprived of its fixed air, which escapes during the process of congelation. Accordingly, as some of the inhabitants of the Alps who use it for their constant drink, have enormous wens upon their throats, it has been ascribed to this circumstance. If this were the cause of these wens, it would be easy to remove it by exposing the snow-water to the air for some time. But several eminent physicians have rejected the notion that snowwater is the cause of these wens ; for in Greenland, where snow-water is commonly used, the inhabitants are not affected with such swellings ; and on the other hand, they are common in Sumatra, where snow is never seen.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
