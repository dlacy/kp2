Twiſting cauſes all the fibres to lie obliquely with reſpect to the axis or general direction of the rope. It may juſt happen that one fibre or one yarn ſhall keep in the axis, and remain ſtraight ; all the reſt muſt be oblique, and the more oblique as they are farther from the axis, and as they are more twiſted. Now it is to be demonſtrated, that when any ſtrain is given to the rope in the direction of its length, a ſtrain greater than this is actually excited on the oblique fibres, and ſo much the greater as they are more oblique ; and thus the fibres which are already the weakeſt are expoſed to the greateſt ſtrains.</p><p>Let CF (fig. 13.) repreſent a fibre hanging from a hook, and loaded with a weight F, which it is juſt able to bear, but not more. This weight may repreſent the abſolute force of the fibre. Let ſuch another fibre be laid over the two pulleys A, B (ſig. 14.), which are in a horizontal line AB, and let weights F and<hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi>  equal to the former, be hung on the ends of this fibre, while another weight R, leſs than the ſum of F and ∕, is hung on the middle point C by a hook or thread. This weight wfill draw dowm the fibre into ſuch a poſition ACB, that the three w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>eights F, R, andj<hi rend="sup">f</hi>, are in equilibrio by the intervention of the fibre. We affirm that this weight R is the meaſure of the relative ſtrength of the fibre in relation to the form ACB ; for the fibre is equally ſtretched in all its parts, and therefore in every part it is ſtrained by the force F. If therefore the weights F and<hi rend="italic">f</hi>  are held faſt, and any addition is made to the weight R, the fibre muſt break, being already ſtrained to its full ſtrength; therefore R meaſures its ſtrength in relation to its ſituation. Complete the parallelogram ACBD, and draw the diagonal CD ; becauſe AB is horizontal, and AC=BC, DC is vertical, and coincides with the direction CR, by which the weight R acts. The point C is drawn by three forces, wfiιich are in equilibrio. They are therefore proportional to the ſides of a triangle, which have the ſame directions ; or, the force acting in the direction CA is to that acting in the direction CR as CA to CD. The point R is ſupported by the two forces CA, CB, which are equivalent to CD ; and therefore the weight F is to the weight R as CA is to CD. Therefore the abſolute ſtrengths of the two fibres AC, BC, taken ſeparately, are greater than their united ſtrengths in relation to their poſition wfitlι reſpect to CR : and ſince this proportion remains the ſame, whatever equal weights are hung on at F and<hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi>  it follows, that when any ſtrain DC is made to act on this ſibre in the direction DC, it excites a greater ſtrain on the fibre, becauſe CA and •CB taken together are greater than CD. Each fibre ffuſtains a ſtrain greater than the half of CD.</p><p>Now let the weight R be turned round the axis CR. This will cauſe the two parts of the fibre ACB to lap round each other, and compoſe aTwiſted line or cord</p><p>CR, as in fig. 15. and the parallelogram ACBD will remain of the ſame form, by the yielding of the weights F and<hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi>  as is evident from the equilibrium of forces. The fibre wfill always aſſume that form which makes the ſides and diagonal in the proportion of the weights. While the fibres lap round each other, they are ſtrained to the ſame degree, that is, to the full extent of their ſtrength, and they remain in this degree of ſtrain in every part of the line or cord CR. If therefore each of the fibres lias the ſtrength AB, the cord has the ſtrength DC ; and if F and<hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>  be held faſt, the ſmalleſt addition to R will break the cord. The ſum of the abſolute ſtrength of the two fibres of which this thread is compoſed is to the ſum of their relative ſtrengths, or to the ſtrength of the thread, as AC-{-CB is to CD, or as AC is to EC.</p><p>If the weights F and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>  are not held faſt, but allowed to yield, a heavier weight <hi rend="italic">r</hi>  may be hung on at C with-out breaking the fibre ; ſor it will draw it into another poſition A <hi rend="italic">c</hi>  B, ſuch that <hi rend="italic">r</hi>  ſhall be in equilibrio wfith F and <hi rend="italic">ſ.</hi>  Since F and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>  remain the ſame, the fibre is as much ſtrained as before. Therefore make <hi rend="italic">c a, cb</hi>  equal to C A and' CB, and complete the parallelogram <hi rend="italic">a c b d. cd</hi>  wfill now be the meaſure of the weight r, becauſe it is the equivalent of <hi rend="italic">c a</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">cb.</hi>  It is evident that <hi rend="italic">cd </hi>is greater than CD, and therefore the thread formed by the lapping of the ſibre in the poſition <hi rend="italic">a c b</hi>  is ſtronger than the former, in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">c d</hi>  to CD, or <hi rend="italic">c e </hi>to CE. The cord is therefore ſo much ſtronger as the fibres are more parallel to the axis, and it muſt be ſtrongeſt of all when they are quite parallel. Bring the pulleys A, B cloſe to each other. It is plain that if we hang on a weight R leſs than the ſum of F and <hi rend="italic">f, </hi>it cannot take down the bight of the fibre; but if equal to them, although it cannot pull it down, it will keep it dow<hi rend="sup">r</hi>n. In this caſe, wfiιen the fibres are parallel to each other, the ſtrength of the cord (improperly ſo called) is equal to the united abſolute ſtrengths of the fibres.</p><p>It is eaſy to ſee that the length of each of the fibres which compoſe any part CR of this cord is to the length of the part of the cord as AC to EC ; and this is the caſe even although they ſhould lap round a cylinder of any diameter. This will appear very clearly to anyperfon who conſiders the thing with attention. Let <hi rend="italic">a c</hi>  (ſig. 16.) be an indefinitely ſmall portion of the fibre which is lapped obliquely round the cylinder, and let HKG be a ſection perpendicular to the axis. Draw <hi rend="italic">a e</hi>  parallel to the axis, and draw <hi rend="italic">e c</hi>  to the centre of the circle HKG, and <hi rend="italic">a e'</hi>  parallel to <hi rend="italic">ec.</hi>  It is plain that <hi rend="italic">e'e </hi>is the length of the axis correſponding to the ſmall portion <hi rend="italic">n c,</hi>  and that <hi rend="italic">e'e</hi>  is equal to <hi rend="italic">a ς.</hi></p><p>Hence we derive another manner of expreſſing the ratio of the abſolute and relative ſtrength; and we may ſay that the abſolute ſtrength of a fibre, wfiιich has the ſame obliquity throughout, is to its relative ſtrength as the length of the ſibre to the length of the cord of which it makes a part. And we may ſay, that the ſtrength of a rope is to the united abſolute ſtrength ρf its yarns as the length, <hi rend="italic">oi</hi>  the cord to the length of the yarns ; for although the yarns are in various ſtates of obliquity, they contribute to the ſtrength of the cord in as much as they contribute immediately to the ſtrength oſ the ſtrands. The ſtrength of the yarns is to that of the ſtrands as the length of the yarns to that of the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
