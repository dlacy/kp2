<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Doubting oſ the RANKS,</span><span class="font1"> is the placing two ranks in one, frequently uſed in the manœuvres of a regiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Ranks and Files,</span><span class="font1"> are the horizontal and vertical lines of ſoldiers when drawn up for ſervice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANSOM, a ſum of money paid for the redemption of a ſlave, or the liberty of a priſoner of war. In our law-books, ranſom is alſo uſed for a fum paid for&nbsp;the pardon of ſome great offence, and to obtain the offender’s liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANULA, a tumor under a child’s tongue, which, like a ligature, hinders it from ſpeaking or fucking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANUNCULUS, crowfoot : A genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the polyandria clafs of&nbsp;plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the&nbsp;26th order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mult'ιfitiquα.</span><span class="font1"> The calyx is pentaphyllous ;&nbsp;there are five petals, each with a melliferous pore on the&nbsp;inſide of the heel ; the feeds naked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Species.</span><span class="font1"> There arc near 40 different ſpecies of this genus, ſix or eight of which claim general eſteem as&nbsp;flowery plants for ornamenting the gardens, and a&nbsp;great number are common weeds in the fields, waters,&nbsp;and paſture ground, not having merit for garden culture. Οί the garden kinds, the principal fort is the&nbsp;Aſiatic or Turkey and Perſian ranunculus, which com-prifes many hundred varieties of large, double, moſt&nbsp;beautiful flowers of various colours : but feveral other&nbsp;ſpecies having varieties with fine double flowers, make&nbsp;a good appearance in a collection, though as thoſe of&nbsp;each ſpecies conſiſt only of one colour, ſome white,&nbsp;others yellow, they are inferior to the Aſiatic ranun-culus, which is large, and diverſified a thouſand ways&nbsp;in rich colours, in different varieties. However, all the&nbsp;garden kinds in general effect a very agreeable diverſity&nbsp;in affemblage in the flower compartments, &amp;c. and they&nbsp;being all very hardy, ſucceed in any open beds and bor-ders, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Culture.</span><span class="font1"> The Aſiatic ſpecies in all its varieties will ſucceed in any light, rich, garden earth ; but the flo-riſts often prepare a particular compoſt for the fine varieties, conſiſting of good garden-mould or paſture-earth, fward and all, a fourth part of rotted cow-dung,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">' and the like portion of ſea-ſand ; and with this they</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">prepare beds four feet wide and two deep : however, in default of fuch compoſt, ufe beds of any good light&nbsp;earth of your garden ; or, if neceffary, it may be made&nbsp;light and ιich with a portion of drift-ſand and rotten&nbsp;dung, cow-dung is moſt commonly recommended ; but&nbsp;they will alſo thrive in beds of well-wrought kitchen-garden earth, and they often profper well in the com-mon flower-borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ſeafon for planting the roots is both in autumn and ſpring ; the autumn plantings generally flower&nbsp;ſtrongeſt and ſooneſt by a month at leaſt, and are ſucceeded by the ſpring-planting in May and June. Per-form the autumnal planting in october and early part&nbsp;of November, but fome plant towards the Iatter end of&nbsp;September in order to have a very early bloom ; but&nbsp;thoſe planted in that month and beginning of Gctober&nbsp;often come up with rank leaves ſoon after, in winter, ſo&nbsp;as to require protection in hard froſts ; thoſe, hς&gt;wever,&nbsp;planted about the middle or latter end of october, and&nbsp;beginning of November, rarely ſhoot up ſtrong till towards ſpring, and will not require ſo much care of cover-ing during winter ; and the ſpring-planting may be per-formed the end of January or beginning of February,&nbsp;or as ſoon as the weather is ſettled ; they will not require any trouble of covering, and will ſucceed the autumnal plants regularly in bloom, and will flower in&nbsp;good perfection. Thus by two or three different plant-ings you may obtain a fucceſſion of thefe beautiful&nbsp;flowers in conſtant bloom from April till the middle of&nbsp;June ; but the autumnal plants, for the general part,&nbsp;not only flower ſtrongeſt, but the roots increaſe more&nbsp;in ſize, and furniſh the beſt off-fets for propagation : it&nbsp;is, however, proper to plant both in ſpring and au-tumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prepare for the choicer ſorts four-feet beds of light earth, and rake the ſurface ſmooth; then plant the&nbsp;roots in rows lengthwiſe the beds, either by drilling&nbsp;them in two inches deep, and ſix inches diſtance in the&nbsp;row, and the rows ſix or eight afunder ; or you may&nbsp;ph nt them by bedding-in, or by dibble planting, the&nbsp;ſame depth and diſtance.</span></p>
