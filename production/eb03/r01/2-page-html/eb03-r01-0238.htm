<p><span class="font0">oſſ the menſtmum, the extract left from the tincture of the Eaſt India rhubarb proved conſiderably the&nbsp;ftrongeſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rhubarb has been cultivated of late in this country with conſiderable ſucceſs, and for medical purpoſes is&nbsp;ſound to equal that of foreign growth, as is proved hy&nbsp;the Tranſactions of the London Society for encoura-ging Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, who have re-warded ſeveral perſons both for cultivating and curing&nbsp;it. In the Tranſactions ſor 1792, the gold medal was&nbsp;adjudged to Sir william Fordyce, for raiſing from ſeed&nbsp;in the year 1791 upwards oſ 300 plants of the true&nbsp;rhubarb, or rheum palmatum of the London Pharmacopoeia 1788, which in the ſecond and third weeks of&nbsp;October were tranſplanted into a deep loam, at four&nbsp;ſeet diſtance from each other, according to rules laid&nbsp;down by the ſociety. In 1793 it was adjudged to Mr&nbsp;Thomas Jones, from whofe papers we derive the follow-ing information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After giving an accurate account of his experiments and obſervations, he concludes, that the ſeaſon ſor ſowing is the ſpring about March or April, or in autumn&nbsp;about Auguſt and September; that thoſe plants which&nbsp;are raiſed in the ſpring ſhould be tranſplanted in autumn,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">vice verſa ;</span><span class="font4"> that they cannot have too much room ;&nbsp;that room and time are eſſentially neceffary to their be-ing large, off a good appearance, and perhaps to the in-creaſe of their purgative qualities ; that to effect theſe&nbsp;purpoſes, the foil muſt be hght, loamy, and rich, but&nbsp;not too much ſo, leſt the roots ſhould be too fibrous ;&nbsp;that their ſituation can ſcarcely be too dry, as more '&nbsp;evils are to be expected from a ſuperabundancy of moiſture than any actual want of it : and laſtly, we may&nbsp;conclude, that in particular the injuries which they are&nbsp;fubject to are principally during their inſancy, and. to&nbsp;be imputed to infects and inattention to the planting&nbsp;ſeaſon ; afterwards, from too great an expoſure to froſt :&nbsp;but that none can be dreaded from heat ; and that in&nbsp;general they are hardy and eaſy of cultivation, when arrived beyond a certain term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The method of curing rhubarb, as propoſed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr </span><span class="font4">Tirruogel of Stockholm, is as follows: &quot; No roots ſhould&nbsp;be taken up till they have been planted ten years : they&nbsp;ſhonld be taken out of the ground either in winter, before the froſt ſets in, or in the beginning of ſpring, and&nbsp;immediately cut into pieces, and carefully barked ; let&nbsp;them be ſpread upon a table ſor three or four days, and&nbsp;be frequently turned, that the juices may thicken or&nbsp;condenſe within the roots. After this procefs, make&nbsp;a hole in each piece, and put a thread through it ; by&nbsp;which let them hang ſeparately, either within doors,&nbsp;or in ſome ſheltereſt ſhady ſhed. Some perſons dry&nbsp;them in a different way : they incloſe the roots in clay,&nbsp;and make a hole in the clay, about the thickneſs of a&nbsp;gooſe-quill, and in this manner bang up each piece to&nbsp;dry ſeparately, that the moiſture may not evaporate,&nbsp;nor the ſtrength of the root be weakened. But the&nbsp;methods which the Tartars follow is a bad one : they&nbsp;dig the roots out of the deſerts where they grow, bark&nbsp;them, and immediately ſtring them, and hang them&nbsp;round the necks of their camels, that they may dry as&nbsp;they travel ; but this greatly leſſens the medicinal virtue&nbsp;of the root.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr </span><span class="font4">Thomas Halley of Pontefract in Yorkſhire, to whom the London Society voted the ſilver medal in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font4">1793, inſorms us, that his father tried various </span><span class="font1">experi</span><span class="font4">ments for curing rhubarb, as waſhing, bruſhing, bark-ing, and peeling, and he dried them in the ſun, on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">kiln, in a ſtove, or in a warm kitchen. But of the ſuc-ceſs of all or either of theſe methods we have no ac-count, owing to the death of Mr Halley’s father. He&nbsp;ſent, however,to them ſive different ſpecimens, which the&nbsp;Society acknowledges to be ſuperſor to any rhubarb hitherto cured in England, and produced to them. The&nbsp;roots ſent, Mr Halley ſays, were planted about the&nbsp;year 1781 in a light ſandyiſh foil, but were much neglected. They were taken up in the ſpring of 1792,&nbsp;and being thoroughly diveſted of the adhering earth,&nbsp;were placed for ſome weeks on the floor of a cool ware-houſe : the ſibres were then taken off, cut up, and dried&nbsp;on the flue of a green-llouſe ; but, from miſmanage-ment, were entirely ſpoiled. The prime roots were&nbsp;fevered in ſmall pieces, peeled clean, and thoroughly&nbsp;cleared of every particle of unſoundneſs. Part was&nbsp;ſeparately laid in lieves, and the remainder perforated,&nbsp;ſtrung, and ſuſpended in ſeſtoons from the cieling of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">warm kitchen. The manner of dreffing conflits in pa-ring off the external coat with a ſharp knife, as thin and&nbsp;clean as poffible, and then ſiniſhing it off by a piece of&nbsp;ſiſh ſkin, with its own -powder ; wliich powder may be&nbsp;procured from the chips and ſmall pieces, either by&nbsp;grinding or pounding it in a large mortar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1794 the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr william Hayward of Hanbury, Oxford-ſhire, for propagating rhubarb by offsets taken from&nbsp;the crowns of large plants, inſtead of ſeeds, for the pur-poſe of bringing it to perfection in a ſhorter time, which&nbsp;fully anſwered his expectations. Mr Hayward was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">candidate in the year 1789 for the gold medal ; but&nbsp;having miſunderſtood their rules, he was not entitled to&nbsp;it, though with great propriety they voted to him the&nbsp;ſilver medal ; in confequence of which he ſent them his&nbsp;method of culture and cure. His method of cultiva-ting Turkey rhubarb from ſeed is thus explained to the&nbsp;Society : “ I have uſually ſown the feed about the beginning of February, on a bed of good foil (if rather&nbsp;ſandy the better), expoſed to an eaſt or weſt aſpect, in&nbsp;preference to the ſouth ; obſerving a full ſun to be prejudicial to the vegetation of the feeds, and to the plants&nbsp;whilſt young. The ſeeds are beſt ſown moderately&nbsp;thick (broaſhcaſt), treading them regularly in, as ia&nbsp;uſual with parſueps and other light ſeeds, and then ra-king the ground ſmooth. I have ſometimes, when the&nbsp;ſeaſon has been wet, made a bed for ſowing the rhu-barb ſeeds upon, about two ſeet thick, with new dung&nbsp;from · the ſtable, covering it near one foot thick with&nbsp;good foil. The intent of this bed is not for the ſake&nbsp;of warmth, but ſolely to prevent the riſing of earthworms, which, in a moiſt ſeaſon, will frequently deſtroy&nbsp;the young ciop. If the ſeed is good, the plants often&nbsp;riſe too thick ; if ſo, when they have attained ſix leaves&nbsp;they ſhould be taken carefully up (where too cloſe),&nbsp;leaving the ſtanding crop eight or ten inches apart :&nbsp;thoſe taken up may be planted at the ſame diſtance, in&nbsp;a freſh fpot of ground, in order to ſurniſh other plantations. when the plants in general are grown to the&nbsp;ſizc that cabbage-plants are uſually ſet out for a ſtanding crop, they are beſt planted where they are to remain, in beds four feet wide, one row along the middle&nbsp;of the bed, leaving two yards diſtance betwixt the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
