<p><span class="font1">the gas that is directly in contact with them, this equilibrium would be the actual state of affairs; and it would follow&nbsp;from the principle of Archimedes that, when extraneous forces&nbsp;such as gravity arc not considered, the gas would exert no&nbsp;resultant force on any body immersed in it. On this ground&nbsp;Maxwell inferred that the forces acting in the radiometer arc&nbsp;connected with gliding of the gas along the unequally heated&nbsp;boundaries; and as the laws of this slipping, as well as the&nbsp;constitution of the adjacent layer, are uncertain, the problem&nbsp;becomes very intricate. Such slipping had shown itself at&nbsp;high exhaustions in the experiments of A. A. Kundt and E. G.&nbsp;Warburg in 1875 on the viscosity of gases; its effects would be&nbsp;corrected for, in general, by a slight effective addition to the&nbsp;thickness of the gaseous layer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reynolds, in his investigation, introducing no new form of law of distribution of velocities, uses a linear quantity,&nbsp;proportional to the mean free path of the gaseous molecules,&nbsp;which he takes to represent (somewhat roughly) the average&nbsp;distance from which molecules directly affect, by their convection, the state of the medium; the gas not being uniform&nbsp;on account of the gradient of temperature, the change going&nbsp;on at each point is calculated from the elements contributed&nbsp;by the parts at this particular distance in all directions. He&nbsp;lays stress on the dimensional relations of the problem, pointing&nbsp;out that the phenomena which occur with large vanes in highly&nbsp;rarefied gas could also occur with proportionally smaller vanes&nbsp;in gas at higher pressure. The results coincide with Maxwell’s&nbsp;so far as above stated, though the numerical coefficients do not&nbsp;agree. According to Maxwell, priority in showing the necessity&nbsp;for slipping over the boundary rests with Reynolds, who also&nbsp;discovered the cognate fact of thermal transpiration, meaning&nbsp;thereby that gas travels up the gradient of temperature in a&nbsp;capillary tube, owing to surface-actions, until it establishes such&nbsp;a gradient of pressure (extremely minute) as will prevent further&nbsp;flow. In later memoirs Reynolds followed up this subject by&nbsp;proceeding to establish definitions of the velocity and the&nbsp;momentum and the energy at an element of volume of the&nbsp;molecular medium, with the precision necessary in order that&nbsp;the dynamical equations of the medium in bulk, based in the&nbsp;usual manner on these quantities alone, without directly considering thermal stresses, shall be strictly valid—a discussion&nbsp;in which the relation of ordinary molar mechanics to the more&nbsp;complete molecular theory is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of late years the peculiarities of the radiometer at higher gas-pressures have been very completely studied by E. F.&nbsp;Nichols and G. F. Hull, with the result that there is a certain&nbsp;pressure at which the molecular effect of the gas on a pair of&nbsp;nearly vertical vanes is balanced by that of convection currents in&nbsp;it. By thus controlling and partially eliminating the aggregate&nbsp;gas-effect, they succeeded in making a small radiometer, horizontally suspended, into a delicate and reliable measurer of&nbsp;the intensity of the radiation incident on it. With the experience thus gained in manipulating the vacuum, the achievement of thoroughly verifying the pressure of radiation on both&nbsp;opaque and transparent bodies, in accordance with Clerk&nbsp;Maxwell’s formula, has been effected (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Review,</span><span class="font1"> 1901,&nbsp;and later papers) by E. F. Nichols and G. F. Hull; some months&nbsp;earlier Lebédew had published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annalen der Physik</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;verification for metallic vanes so thin as to avoid the gas-action, by preventing the production of sensible difference of&nbsp;temperature between the two faces by the incident radiation.&nbsp;(See RADIATION. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More recently J. H. Poynting has separated the two effects experimentally on the principle that the radiometer pressure&nbsp;acts along the normal, while the radiation pressure acts along&nbsp;the ray which may be directed obliquely. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J.

<p><span class="font1">RADISH, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raphanus sativus</span><span class="font1"> (nat. order Cruciferae), in botany, a fleshy-rooted annual, unknown in the wild state. Some&nbsp;varieties of the wild radish, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. Raphanistrum,</span><span class="font1"> however, met&nbsp;with on the Mediterranean coasts, come so near to it as&nbsp;to suggest that it may possibly be a cultivated race of the&nbsp;same species. It is very popular as a raw salad. There are&nbsp;two principal forms, the spindle-rooted and the turnip-rooted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The radish succeeds in any well-worked not too heavy garden soil, but requires a warm, sheltered situation. The seed is&nbsp;generally sown broadcast, in beds 4 to 5 ft. wide, with alleys&nbsp;between, the beds requiring to be netted over to protect them&nbsp;from birds. The earliest crop may be sown about the middle&nbsp;of December, the seed-beds being at once covered with litter,&nbsp;which should not be removed till the plants come up, and then&nbsp;only in the daytime, and when there is no frost. If the crop&nbsp;succeeds, which depends on the state of the weather, it will be&nbsp;in use about the beginning of March. Another sowing may be&nbsp;made in January, a third early in February, if the season is a&nbsp;favourable one, and still another towards the end of February,&nbsp;from which time till October a small sowing should be made&nbsp;every fortnight or three weeks in spring, and rather more&nbsp;frequently during summer. About the end of October, and&nbsp;again in November, a late sowing may be made on a south border&nbsp;or bank, the plants being protected in severe weather with litter&nbsp;or mats. The winter radishes, which grow to a large size, should&nbsp;be sown in the beginning of July and in August, in drills from&nbsp;6 to 9 in. apart, the plants being thinned out to 5 or 6 in. in&nbsp;the row. The roots become fit for use during the autumn. For&nbsp;winter use they should be taken up before severe frost sets in,&nbsp;and stored in dry sand. Radishes, like other fleshy roots, are&nbsp;attacked by insects, the most dangerous being the larvae of&nbsp;several species of fly, especially the radish fly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Anthomyia&nbsp;radie urn).</span><span class="font1"> The most effectual means of destroying these is by&nbsp;watering the plants with a dilute solution of carbolic acid, or&nbsp;much diluted gas-water; or gas-lime may be sprinkled along&nbsp;the rows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Forcing. </span><span class="font0">—To obtain early radishes a sowing in the British Isles should be made about the beginning of November, and continued&nbsp;fortnightly till the middle or end of February; the crop will gener-ally be fit for use about six weeks after sowing. The seed should&nbsp;be sown in light rich soil, 8 or 9 in. thick, on a moderate hotbed,&nbsp;or in a pit with a temperature of from 55<sup>o</sup> to 65<sup>o</sup>. Gentle waterings&nbsp;must be given, and air admitted at every favourable opportunity;&nbsp;but the sashes must be protected at night and in frosty weather&nbsp;with straw mats or other materials. Some of these crops are often&nbsp;grown with forced potatoes. The best forcing sorts are Wood’s&nbsp;early frame, and the early rose globe, early dwarf-top scarlet turnip,&nbsp;and early dwarf-top white turnip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those best suited for general cultivation are the following: —</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spindle-rooted. </span><span class="font0">—Long scarlet, including the sub-varieties scarlet short-top, early frame scarlet, and Wood’s early frame; long scarlet&nbsp;short-top, best for general crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Turnip-rοοted. —</span><span class="font0">Early rose globe-shaped, the earliest of all; early dwarf-top scarlet turnip, and early dwarf-top white turnip;&nbsp;earliest Erfurt scarlet, and early white short-leaved, both very&nbsp;early sorts; French breakfast, olive-shaped; red turnip and&nbsp;white turnip, for summer crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Winter sorts. —</span><span class="font0">Black Spanish, white Chinese, Californian mammoth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADIUM (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">radius,</span><span class="font1"> ray), a metallic chemical element obtained from pitchblende, a uranium mineral, by P. and Mme.&nbsp;Curie and G. Bémont in 1898; it was so named on account of&nbsp;the intensity of the radioactive emanations which it yielded.&nbsp;Its discovery was a sequel to H. Becquerel’s observation in 1896&nbsp;that certain uranium preparations emitted a radiation resembling the X rays observed by Röntgen in 1895. Like the X&nbsp;rays, the Becquerel rays are invisible; they both traverse thin&nbsp;sheets of glass or metal, and cannot be refracted; moreover,&nbsp;they both ionize gases, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> they discharge a charged electroscope,&nbsp;the latter, however, much more feebly than the former. Characteristic, also, is their action on a photographic plate, and the&nbsp;phosphorescence which they occasion when they impinge on&nbsp;zinc sulphide and some other salts.
