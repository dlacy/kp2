He expired in the fifty-third year of his age, after&nbsp;a reign of six years. Whether he committed suicide or&nbsp;was poisoned cannot now be ascertained ; his death could&nbsp;hardly have been natural. Boris was a man of great&nbsp;energy of character, with views singularly in advance of his&nbsp;age. In some respects he anticipated the plans of Peter&nbsp;the Great ; thus he caused several young Russians to be sent&nbsp;abroad to be educated, some of whom came to England.&nbsp;By a ukaze, however, binding the peasant to the soil, he&nbsp;began the system which reduced him by degrees to a condition of abject serfdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Boris had left a sufficient number of partisans at Moscow to proclaim his son Feodor, a youth of sixteen, and all&nbsp;classes took the oath of allegiance to him. Shuiski and&nbsp;Mstislavski returned to Moscow to assist the young czar&nbsp;in the government. Basmanoff was sent to take the&nbsp;command of the army, but, probably feeling the cause of&nbsp;Feodor to be desperate, on the 7th of May he proclaimed&nbsp;Dmitri. He was now ordered to march on the capital.&nbsp;Feodor, however, and his adherents still held the Kremlin&nbsp;with a large garrison. Accordingly it was resolved to&nbsp;make an attempt on Krasnoe Selo, a large town near&nbsp;Moscow, where many wealthy merchants resided. This&nbsp;was easily taken, whereupon many of its citizens marched&nbsp;to Moscow, and convoking the people called upon them to&nbsp;acknowledge Dmitri as their sovereign. Feodor and his&nbsp;mother were murdered, and buried in a cemetery outside the city walls, whither also the remains of Boris&nbsp;were carried, for they were not allowed sepulture among&nbsp;the tombs of the czars. Petreius, the Swedish envoy,&nbsp;who has left us an interesting account of these times, tells&nbsp;us that the rumour was circulated that these unhappy&nbsp;people had poisoned themselves, but he himself saw their&nbsp;bodies, and the marks on their necks of the cords with&nbsp;which they had been strangled. According to some&nbsp;authorities, Xenia, the daughter of Boris, described as&nbsp;beautiful by the old Russian chronicler Kubasoff, was&nbsp;forced to retire into a convent, but Petreius declares that&nbsp;she was compelled to become the mistress of the conqueror.&nbsp;The usurper now hearing that every obstacle was removed,&nbsp;marched upon the capital, which lie entered on June 20,&nbsp;1605. We have not space to detail the splendours of his&nbsp;retinue, nor the ceremonies and feastings which attended&nbsp;his arrival. He acted at first with prudence and conciliation towards his new subjects, and even promised to pay&nbsp;the debts of his father Ivan. He received his mother&nbsp;with transports of joy; she professed to identify him,&nbsp;although she afterwards denied that he was her son.&nbsp;She was probably, however, glad enough to get out of&nbsp;the convent into which she had been thrust by Boris.&nbsp;But Dmitri soon gave offence on account of his neglect&nbsp;of Russian etiquette and superstitious observances. It&nbsp;was plain that he held the Greek Orthodox religion very&nbsp;cheap, and his subjects could see that he had a propensity&nbsp;for the Latin heresy. In the following year Marina&nbsp;Mniszek, his bride, made her appearance in Moscow, and&nbsp;the marriage took place on the 18th of May. It was&nbsp;followed by continued banquets. But a rebellion broke&nbsp;out on the 29th, at the head of which was Vasilii&nbsp;Shuiski, whom Dmitri had spared when about to be&nbsp;executed. The czar, hearing a noise in the night, and&nbsp;finding himself surrounded by enemies, opened a window&nbsp;30 feet from the ground, leapt down, and broke his leg.&nbsp;He was soon afterwards found and killed. Basmanoff was&nbsp;slain while attempting to defend his master. The corpse&nbsp;of the impostor was afterwards burned. Marina was not&nbsp;killed, although there was a great massacre of the Poles&nbsp;in every quarter of Moscow ; she and the ladies of her&nbsp;suite were kept as prisoners. Thus ended this remarkable&nbsp;episode of Russian history. The whole period has been&nbsp;aptly termed by the national historians “the Period of&nbsp;Troubles ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Smutnoye Vremya).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The boiars, on being convoked after the murder of Dmitri, elected Vasilii Ivanovich Shuiski for their&nbsp;sovereign, but he found himself in every way disadvan-tageously situated, without an army and without money.&nbsp;He was, moreover, troubled by an announcement which&nbsp;gained credence among the people that Dmitri was not&nbsp;really dead. To put an end to these rumours, Shuiski,&nbsp;entirely changing his policy, and contradicting his previous assertions, sent to Uglich for the body of the unfortunate prince, and caused him to be canonized. Two&nbsp;subsequent impostors, who gave themselves out to be&nbsp;Dmitri, were taken and executed. To complete the misfortunes of Russia, the country was invaded by the Poles&nbsp;in 1609, who laid siege to Smolensk. Shuiski was&nbsp;defeated at Klushino (a village situated to the north-east&nbsp;of Moscow), was taken prisoner, and was set free, to&nbsp;become a monk,—a favourite way of treating troublesome&nbsp;persons in Russia. He was afterwards delivered over to&nbsp;Sigismund, who kept him in prison during the rest of&nbsp;his life. The crown was finally offered to Ladislaus, the&nbsp;son of Sigismund, who in reality for two years was&nbsp;sovereign of Russia, and caused money to be coined in&nbsp;his name at Moscow. Everything seemed to portend the&nbsp;ruin of the country, when it was saved by the bravery of&nbsp;Minin, the butcher of Nijni-Novgorod, who roused the&nbsp;citizens to arms by his patriotic appeal, and was joined by&nbsp;Prince Pozharski. The latter took the command of the&nbsp;army ; the administrative department was handed over to&nbsp;the former. The brave prince succeeded in driving the&nbsp;Poles from Russia. In 1612 the boiars resolved to elect&nbsp;a new czar, but they did not actually meet till 1613, and&nbsp;many debates ensued. The sufferings of the country had&nbsp;been great ; a considerable part of the city of Moscow&nbsp;(with the exception of the Kremlin and the churches built&nbsp;of stone) was laid in ashes. The treasury was plundered,&nbsp;and its contents sent to Poland. Among other things&nbsp;Olearius, the traveller of the 17th century, quaintly adds,&nbsp;“ the Russians lost the horn of a unicorn of great value,&nbsp;set with precious stones,” which was also carried off to&nbsp;Poland ; and he tells us that even up to his time the&nbsp;Muscovites bitterly regretted that they had been robbed&nbsp;of it. Princes Mstislavski and Pozharski refused the&nbsp;crown, and finally the name of Michael Romanoff, a youth&nbsp;of sixteen, was put forward as a candidate, chiefly on&nbsp;account of the virtues of his father Philarete. The&nbsp;Romanoffs were connected on the female side with the&nbsp;house of Rurik, Anastasia Romanova having been the&nbsp;first wife of Ivan the Terrible. Before being allowed to&nbsp;ascend the throne, the youthful sovereign, according to&nbsp;some authors, took a constitutional oath. The condition of the country all this time was most critical;&nbsp;large portions of its territory were in the hands of&nbsp;the Swedes and Poles, and the villages were plundered by wandering bands of Cossacks. Ladislaus the&nbsp;son of Sigismund had not yet renounced the title of&nbsp;czar; in 1617 he appeared with an invading army under&nbsp;the walls of Moscow, but was repulsed, and on December 1,&nbsp;1618, consented to abandon his claims, and conclude an&nbsp;armistice for fourteen years. In 1617 a treaty had been&nbsp;made at Stolbovo, a town near Lake Ladoga, by which&nbsp;the Russians had been compelled to give up a large&nbsp;portion of their territory to the Swedes. Philarete, the&nbsp;father of Michael, who had been for some time imprisoned&nbsp;at Warsaw, was now allowed to return ; he entered&nbsp;Moscow in 1619, and was elected patriarch, an office which&nbsp;had been vacant since the death of Hermogenes. Michael&nbsp;associated his father with himself in his power ; all ukazes</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
