<p><label>REVIEW</label>
(Fr. <hi rend="italic">revue,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">revoir,</hi> to see again, Lat. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> and <hi rend="italic">videre),</hi> an inspection or critical examination; it is chiefly used as a military or naval term for an inspection on a large or formal scale of a fleet or hody of troops by the sovereign or other person holding a high official position, or for a critical account of a recently published literary work in a magazine or periodical. The earliest use of the word for fhe title of such a periodical was in the paper begun by Defoe in 1704, the full title of which was <hi rend="italic">A Review of lhe Affairs of France and of all Europe, as influ</hi> <hi rend="italic">enced by that Nation</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Periodicals</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Newspapers).</hi> In France there is a particular application of the term <hi rend="italic">revue</hi> or, more fully, <hi rend="italic">revue de fin P ann√©e</hi> to a form of dramatic performance, acted or sung, in which the chief events of the past year, and the personages who have been prominently before the public, are satirically and critically passed under review. Attempts have been made to trace such performances to an early origin. In their modern form, however, they date from the reign of Louis Philippe. <hi rend="italic">UAn</hi> <hi rend="italic">1841 elVan 1941,</hi> by the brothers Cogniard, was one of the earliest.</p>
