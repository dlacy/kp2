<p><span class="font2">was ſpeedily to burſt forth in a bloody tempeſt.—In the preſent cafe, the people oſ Paris became moſt eager-ly intereſted. Rumours of plots were ſpread through&nbsp;the country, and a new ſtorm was obviouſly gathering,&nbsp;when the queſtion was thus got quit of. M. Mounier&nbsp;remarked, that the executive power could poffeſs no&nbsp;negativc againſt the decrees of the preſent aſſembly,&nbsp;which had been nominated by the nation with ſuprem£&nbsp;powers for the expreſs purpoſe of framing a conſtitu-tion, which was to remain binding over all orders of men.&nbsp;in the ſtate ; and with regard to future legiſlatures, the&nbsp;king declared by a meſſage, that he wiſhed to poſſefe&nbsp;no more than a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſuſpenfive veto.</span><span class="font2"> It is remarkable that&nbsp;the popular Mirabeau concluded a fpeech in favour of&nbsp;the abſolute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto</span><span class="font2"> of the crown with thefe words,&nbsp;&quot; Tlιat it would be better to live in Conſtantinople&nbsp;than in France, if laws could be made without the&nbsp;royal function.” This political adventurer is, however,&nbsp;accufed of having taken care to circulate in Paris a report that he had oppoſed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto</span><span class="font2"> with all his influence ; and to give credit to the ſtory, he is ſaid to have&nbsp;quitted the aſſembly juſt before the diviſion, that his&nbsp;vote might not appear on record againſt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the debates about the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto</span><span class="font2"> the month of Auguſt was ſpent ; and in the beginning of September a new&nbsp;conſtitutional queſtion was prefented to the aſſembly by&nbsp;one of its numerous committees. This was, whether&nbsp;the legiſlative body ought to conſiſt of one or of two&nbsp;chambers ? Mounier, Lally, Tollendal, Clermont&nbsp;Tonnerre, and others, who were zealous lovers of&nbsp;freedom upon what were then accounted moderate&nbsp;principles, ſupported eagerly the idea of eſtabliſhing&nbsp;two independent chambers in imitation of the Brſtiſh&nbsp;conſtitution ; but they were deſerted both by the democratic and ariſtocratic parties. The firſt of theſe re-garded an upper houſe or ſenate as a refuge for the o!d&nbsp;ariſtocracy, or as the cradle of a new one ; while the&nbsp;higher nobles and clergy feared leſt ſuch an arrange-ιnent might prevent the future re-eſtabliſhment of the&nbsp;ancient diviſion into three orders. Οί ιοοο members&nbsp;who voted, only 89 fupported the propofal for dividing&nbsp;the legiſlature into two chambers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Soon after this, the king gave his fonction to the important decrees of the 4tl1 of Auguſt, but not with-. out ſome heſitation, and expreffing doubts of the wiſdom of ſome of them in a letter to the aſſembly. At&nbsp;the fame time the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inviolability</span><span class="font2"> of the perſon of the monarch was decreed, the indiviſibility of the throne, and&nbsp;its hereditary deſcent from male to male in the reigning family.—But we ſhall not here attempt to enter&nbsp;into a detail of the various articles of the new conſti-tution as connected with the circumſtances under which&nbsp;they became the ſubject of debate, we ſhall only ſtate&nbsp;thoſe more remarkable circumſtances which tend to aſ-certain the peculiar changes which the ſentiments of&nbsp;the nation underwent in the progreſs of a revolution&nbsp;the moſt remarkable that occurs in human hiſtory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In confequence oſ the debates upon the queſtions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto</span><span class="font0"> and the two chambers, the minds of parties&nbsp;had become much irritated. Paris wore the fome&nbsp;threatening afpect that it had done in the months of&nbsp;June and of July preceding ; and every thing feemed&nbsp;tending towards an important criſis. The ariſtocratiq&nbsp;party accuſed their antagoniſts of a deſign to excite&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">¢ew inſurrections j and the charge was retorted, by cir</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">culating a report that a plot for conveying the king </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Metz was already ripe for execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the period 0f the defection of the French, guards, who were now in the pay of the capital, the&nbsp;protection of the royal family had been entruſted to&nbsp;thes militia or national guard of Verfailles, together&nbsp;with the regiment of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gardes du corps,</span><span class="font2"> which was&nbsp;compoſed entirely of gentlemen. Upon the circulation of the report of the intended flight of the king,&nbsp;the French guards, began to wi∏ι to be reſtored to&nbsp;their ancient employment of attending his perſon, for&nbsp;the purpoſe of preventing any attempt of this nature.&nbsp;This idea was eagerly cheriihed by the capital ; and,&nbsp;in ſpite of every effort uſed by M. de la Fayette, the&nbsp;obvious appearance of approaching diſturbances could&nbsp;not be prevented. The popular party fow the advan-tages which they would derive from placing the aſſem*&nbsp;bly and the king in thc midſt of that turbulent metro-polis which had given birth to -the revolution, an&lt;L&nbsp;upon the attachment of which they could moſt ſecurely&nbsp;depend. Every encouragement was therefore given-by the moſt active leaders of what was now called the.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Democratic</span><span class="font2"> party to the project of eſtabliihing the court&nbsp;at Paris. The miniſtry were under no finall degree of&nbsp;alarm ; and the count d’ Eſtaing, who commanded the&nbsp;national guard of Verfailles, requeſted the aid of an.&nbsp;additional regiment. The regiment of Flanders was.&nbsp;accordingly lent for : its arrival caufed no ſmall degree of anxiety and every effort was inſtantly made,&nbsp;to gain over both officers and ſoldiers to the popular&nbsp;cauſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Οη the ſirſt of october the garde du corps, probably for the purpoſe of ingratiating tb.emſelves with thc newly arrived regiment, and perhaps to attach them more·&nbsp;ſteadily to the royal cauſe, invited the officers of the&nbsp;regiment of Flanders to a public entertainment. Several officers of the national guard, and others of the military, were invited. Tlie entertainment was given in&nbsp;the opera houſe adjoining to the palace ; ſeveral loyal&nbsp;toaſts were drank; but it is aſſerted, that when the fa-vυurite popular toεit </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font2"> was given, it was-rejected by the gardes du corps. In ordinary cafes,,&nbsp;ſuch a trifling circumſtance as this, or even any other&nbsp;of the tranſactions of a night of feſtivity,. would' juſtly&nbsp;be regarded as unworthy of notice in recording thç&nbsp;more remarkable events in the hiſtory of a great nation ; but ſuch was now the ſingular ſtate of affairs»,&nbsp;that the moſt trivial occurrences were inſtruroental, by&nbsp;their combination, in the production of important con-ſequences. The queen, having ieen from a window of&nbsp;the palace the gaiety which prevailed among the military, prevailed- with the king,, who-was juif returned,&nbsp;from huntings to viſit tÉem along with herfelf and the&nbsp;dauphin. Their ſudden appearance in. thc foloon kin-dled in an inſtant the ancient euthuſiaſra of French..-loyalty. The grenadiers of the regiment of Flanders,&nbsp;along with the Swifs chaſſeurs, had been admitted to»&nbsp;the defert ; and they, as well as their officers, drank,&nbsp;the health of the King, Queen, and Dauphin, with their&nbsp;ſwords drawn. The royal family having bowed, with po∙&nbsp;liteneſs to the company, retired.—Οί all nations, the&nbsp;French are moſt liable to the influence of ſudden im-∙&nbsp;preflions: the muſic played the favourite air, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">0 Ricard </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">0 mon Roi !
