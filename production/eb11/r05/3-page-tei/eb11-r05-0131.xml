            <p>of higher schools, in which careful instruction is given in natural and social
                sciences, have been opened in the chief cities under the name of “ pedagogical
                courses.” At St Petersburg a women's medical academy, the examinations of which were
                even more searching than those of the ordinary academy (especially as
                regards diseases of women and children), was opened, but after about one hundred
                women had received the degree of M.D. it was suppressed by government. In several
                university towns there are free teaching establishments for women, supported by
                subscription, with programmes and examinations equal to those of the
                universities.</p>
            <p>The natural sciences are much cultivated in Russia. Besides the Academy of Science,
                the Moscow Society of Naturalists, the Mineralogical Society, the Geographical
                Society, with its Caucasian and Siberian branches, the archaeological societies and
                the scientific societies of the Baltic provinces, all of which are of old and
                recognized standing, there have lately sprung up a series of new societies in
                connexion with each university, and their serials are yearly growing in importance,
                as, too, are those of the Moscow Society of Friends of Natural Science, the
                Chemico-Physical Society, and various medical, educational and other associations.
                The work achieved by Russian savants, especially in biology, physiology and
                chemistry, and in the sciences descriptive.of the vast territory of Russia, is well
                known to Europe.</p>
            <p>The ordinary revenue of the empire is in excess of the ordinary expenditure, but.the
                extraordinary expenditure not only swallows up this surplus, but necessitates the
                raising, of fresh loans every year. On the other hand, there is a good deal to show
                for this extraordinary expenditure. A considerable number of new railways, including
                the Siberian, have been built with money obtained from that source. But since 1894
                all extraordinary items of expenditure, with the exception of those for the
                construction of new lines of railway, have been defrayed out of. ordinary, revenue.
                The only sources of extraordinary revenue still remaining under that head are the
                money derived from loans and the perpetual deposits in the Imperial Bank. The
                ordinary revenue,- obtained principally from the sale of spirits (28%), which is a
                state monopoly, from state railways (23 j%) and customs (10j%), steadily rose from a
                total of £132,750,000 in 1895 to a total of £214,360,000 in 1905. Other noteworthy
                sources of revenue are trade licences, direct taxes on lands and forests,
                stamp duties, posts and telegraphs, indirect taxes on tobacco, sugar and other
                commodities, the crown forests, and land redemption payable annually by the peasants
                since 1861. At the same time the total ordinary expenditure has increased at a
                similarly steady rate, namely, from £119,391,000 in 1895 to £202,544,000 in 1905.
                In 1904, 8ii%of the extraordinary expenditure, namely, £71,550,000, was incurred in
                consequence of the war with Japan, and to this must be added in 1906 a further
                expenditure of £42,085,000. The total national debt of Russia nearly trebled between
                1852 (£57,038,600) and 1862 (£145,500,000), and again between 1872 (£242,277,000)
                and 1892 (£526,109,000) it more than doubled, while by 1906 it amounted altogether
                to £812,040,000. Of the</p>
            <p>total, 77% stands at 4% and 17 at less than 4%.</p>
            <p>The system of obligatory military service for all, introduced in 1874, has been
                maintained, but the six years' term of service has been reduced to five, while the
                privileges granted.to young men who have received various degrees of education have
                been slightly extended. During the reign of Alexander III. efforts were mainly
                directed towards—(1) reducing the time required for the mobilization of the army;
                (2) increasing.the immediate readiness of cavalry for war and its fitness for
                serving as mounted infantry (dragoon regiments taking the place of hussars
                and lancers ; (3) strengthening the W. frontier by fortresses .and railways; and (4)
                increasing the artillery, siege and train reserves. Further, the age releasing from
                service was raised from 40 to 43 years and the militia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(landsturm)</hi> was reorganized. The measures taken during the reign of
                Nicholas II. have been chiefly directed towards increasing tne fighting capacity and
                readiness for immediate service of the troops in Asia,, and towards the better
                reorganization of the local irregular militia forces. Broadly, speaking, the army is
                divided into regulars, Cossacks and militia. The peace strength of the army is
                estimated at .42,000 officers and 1,100,000 men (about 950,000 combatants), while
                the war strength is approximately 75,000 officers and 4,500,000 men. However, this
                latter figure is merely nominal, the available artillery and train service being
                much below the strength which would be required for such an army; estimates which
                put the military forces of Russia in time of war at 2,750,000—irrespective of
                the armies which may be levied during the war itself—seem to approach more nearly
                the strength of the forces which could actually be mustered. The infantry and rifles
                are armed with small-bore magazine rifles, and the active artillery have steel
                breech-loaders</p>
            <p>with extreme ranges of 4150 to 4700 yds.</p>
            <p>Before the Japanese war Russia maintained four separate squadrons: the Baltic, the
                Black Sea, the Pacific and the Caspian.</p>
            <p>But in the operations before Port Arthur and in the disastrous battle of Tsushima the
                Russian fleets were almost completely annihilated. The bulk of the Black Sea
                fleet and a few other battleships were, however, still left, and since 1904</p>
            <p>steps have been taken to build new ships, both battleships and</p>
            <p>gowerful cruisers. Kronstadt is the naval headquarters in the</p>
            <p>¡altic, Sevastopol in the Black Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Fortresses.—</hi>The chief first-class fortresses of Russia are
                Warsaw and Novogeorgievsk in Poland, and Brest-Litovsk and Kovno in Lithuania. The
                second-class fortresses are Kronstadt and Sveaborg in the Gulf of Finland, Ivangorod
                in Poland, Libau on the Baltic Sea, Kerch on the Black Sea and Vladivostok on the
                Pacific. In the third class are Viborg in Finland, Ossovets and Ust Dvinsk (or
                Dtinamtinde) in Lithuania, Sevastopol and Ochakov on the Black Sea, and Kars and
                Batum in Caucasia. There are, moreover, 46 forts and fortresses unclassed, of which
                6 are in Poland, 8 in W. and S.W. Russia, and the remainder (mere fortified
                posts) in the Asiatic dominions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Geography.—</hi>The administrative boundaries of European
                        Russia, apart from Finland, coincide broadly with the natural limits of the
                        East-European plains. In the N. it is bounded by the Arctic Ocean; the
                        islands of Novaya-Zemlya, Kolguyevand Vaigach also belong to it, but the
                        Kara Sea is reckoned to Siberia. To the E. it has the Asiatic dominions of
                        the empire, Siberia and the Kirghiz steppes, from both of which it is
                        separated by the Ural Mountains, the Ural river and the Caspian—the
                        administrative boundary, however, partly extending into Asia on the Siberian
                        slope of the Urals. To the S. it has the Black Sea and Caucasia,
                        being separated from the latter by the Manych depression, which
                        in Post-Pliocene times connected the Sea of Azov with the Caspian. The W.
                        boundary is purely conventional: it crosses the peninsula of Kola from the
                        Varanger Fjord to the Gulf of Bothnia; thence it runs to the Kurisches Haff
                        in the southern’Baltic, and thence to the mouth of the Danube, taking a
                        great circular sweep to the W. to embrace Poland, and separating Russia from
                        Prussia, Austrian Galicia and Rumania.</p>
                    <p>It is a special feature of Russia that she has no free outlet to the open sea
                        except on the ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean. Even the White Sea is
                        merely a gulf of that ocean. The deep indentations of the gulfs of Bothnia
                        and Finland are surrounded by what is ethnologically Finnish territory, and
                        it is only at the very head of the latter gulf that the Russians have taken
                        firm foothold by erecting their capital at the mouth of the Neva. The Gulf
                        of Riga and the Baltic belong also to territory which is not inhabited by
                        Slavs, but by Finnish races and by Germans. It is only within the last
                        hundred and thirty years that the Russians have definitely taken possession
                        of the N. shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The E. coast of the
                        Black Sea belongs properly to Transcaucasia, a great chain of
                        mountains separating it from Russia. But even this sheet of water is
                        an inland sea, the only outlet of which, the Bosphorus, is in foreign hands,
                        while the Caspian, an immense shallow’ lake, mostly bordered by deserts,
                        possesses more importance as a link between Russia and her Asiatic
                        settlements than as a channel for intercourse with other countries.</p>
                    <p>The great territory occupied by European Russia—1600 m. in length from N. to
                        S., and nearly as much from E. to W.—is on the whole a broad elevated plain,
                        ranging between 500 and 900 ft. above sea-level, deeply cut into by
                        river-valleys, and bounded on all sides by broad swellings or low
                        mountain-ranges: the lake plateaus of Finland and the Maanselka heights in
                        the N.W.; the Baltic coast-ridge and spurs of the Carpathians in the W.,
                        with a broad depression between the two, occupied by Poland; the Crimean
                        and Caucasian mountains in the S.; and the broad but moderately high
                        swelling of the Ural Mountains in the E.</p>
                    <p>From a central plateau, which comprises the governments of Tver, Moscow,
                        Smolensk and Kursk, and projects E. towards Samara, attaining an average
                        elevation of 800 to 900 ft. above the sea, the surface slopes gently in all
                        directions to a level of 300 to 500 ft. Then it again nses gradually as it
                        approaches the hilly tracts which enclose the great plain. This central
                        swelling may be considered a continuation towards the E.N.E. of the great
                        line of upheavals of N.W. Europe; the elevated grounds of Finland would then
                        represent a continuation of the Scanian plateaus of S. Sw'eden, and
                        the northern mountains of Finland a continuation of Kjfilen (the Keel) which
                        separate Sweden from Norway, while the other great line of</p>
