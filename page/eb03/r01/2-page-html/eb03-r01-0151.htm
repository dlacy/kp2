<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">V∏ιen the </span><span class="font1">velocity is three feet per ſecond, requiring the productive Height 2 ι ,5 lines, the heights correſponding to the non-preffure on the poop of a thin plane is 14,41 lines (taking in ſeveral circumſtances of&nbsp;judicious correction, which we have not mentioned),&nbsp;that of a foot cube is 5,83, and that of a box of triple&nbsp;length is 3,-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font1"> expreſs the variable ratio of theſe to the height producing the velocity, ſo that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q h</span><span class="font1"> may expreſs the non-preffnre in every cafe ; we have,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a thin plane &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q ~</span><span class="font1"> 0,67</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a cube &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0,271</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a box ~ 3 cubes - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o, 153</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is evident that the value of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font1"> has a dependence on the proportion of the length, and the tranſverſe fiction&nbsp;of the body. A firies oſ experiments oil priſmatic bo-dies ſhowed Mr de Bπat that the deviation of the ſila-meπts was ſimilar in ſimilar bodies, and that this ob-tained even in diſſimilar priſms, when the lengths were&nbsp;as the ſquare-roots of the tranfverſe fictions. Although&nbsp;therefore the experiments were not ſufficiently numerous for deducing the precifi law, it ſeemed not impoſ-ſible to derive from them a very ufeful approximation.&nbsp;By a dexterous compariſon he found, that if Z expreffes&nbsp;the length of the priſm, and r the area of the tranſverſe&nbsp;fiction, and ∑<sub>j</sub> expreffes the common logarithm of the&nbsp;quantity to which it is prefixed, we ſhall expreſs the&nbsp;non-preffure pretty accurately by the formula <sup>1</sup>~-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence arifis an important remark, that when the height correſponding to the non-preſſion is greater than&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">»,/s,</span><span class="font1"> and the body is little immerfid in the fluid, there&nbsp;will be a void behind it.. Thus a ſurface of a ſquare&nbsp;inch, juſt immerfid in a current of three feet per ſe--cond, will have a void behind it. A foot ſquare will&nbsp;be in a fimilar condition when the velocity is 12 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we muſt be careful to diſtinguiſh this non-preffure from the other caufis of reſtſtance, which are always&nbsp;neceffarily combined with it. It is fuperadditive to&nbsp;the active impreffion on the prow, to the ftatical preſ-ffure of the accumulation a-head of the body, the llaticaî&nbsp;preffure ariſing from the depreſſion behind it, the effects&nbsp;of friction, and the effects of tenacity. It is indeed&nbsp;next to impoſſible to eſtimate them feparately, and many&nbsp;of them are actually combined in the meafures now given. Nothing can determine the pure nou-preffures&nbsp;till we can aſcertain the motions of the filaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr de Buat here takes occaſion to controvert the univerſally adopted maxim, that the preffure &lt;3ccaf1oned&nbsp;by a ſtream of ſtuid on a fixed body is the ſame with&nbsp;that on a body moving with equal velocity in a qui-efcent fluid. He repeated all theſe experiments with&nbsp;the perforated box in ſtill water. The general diſtinc-tipn was, that both the preffures and the non-preffure&nbsp;in this caſe was leſs, and that the odds was chiefly to&nbsp;be obfirved near the edges of the ſurface. The gene-ral factor of the preffure of a ftream on the anterior fur-face was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m </span><span class="font1">~ 1,186; but that on a body moving&nbsp;through a ſtill ſtuid is only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font1"> — 1. Fie obſerved no&nbsp;non-preffure even at the very edge of the prow, but&nbsp;even a finſible preffure. The preffure, therefore, or re-ſiſtance, is more equably diffufid over the ſurface of the&nbsp;prow than the impulſe is.— He alfo found that the reſiſtances diminiſhed in a leſs ratio than the ſquares of&nbsp;the velocities, eſpecially in ſmall velocities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The non-preſſures increaſed in a greater ratio than the ſquares of the velocities. The ratio of the velocities to a&nbsp;ſmall velocity of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2(</span><span class="font1"> inches </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font1"> ſecond increaſed geome-trically, the value of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font1"> increafid arithmetically ; and we&nbsp;may determine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q for any</span><span class="font1"> velocity V by this proportion</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">let the common logarithm of the velocity, divided by 2ſ, be conſidered as a common number ; divide&nbsp;this common number by 2<sub>1</sub>⅞∙, the quotient is y, which&nbsp;muſt be multiplied by the productive height. The pro-duct is the preffure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when Pitot’s tube was expofid to the ſtream, we had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m —</span><span class="font1"> 1 ; but rvhen it is carried through ſtill water,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font1"> is = 1,22. when it was turned from the ſtream,&nbsp;we had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q —</span><span class="font1"> 0,157 ; but when carried through ſtili&nbsp;water, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font1"> is =0,138. A remarkable experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when the tube was moved laterally through the wa-ter, ſo that the motion was in the direction of the plane of its mouth, the non-preffure was — 1. This is one&nbsp;of his chief arguments for his theory of non-preſſion.&nbsp;Fie does not give the detail of the experiment, and&nbsp;only infirts the reſult in his table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a body expofid to a ftream deflects the ſtuid, heaps it up, and increaſes its velocity; fo a body moved&nbsp;through a ſtill fluid turns it aſide, caufis it to ſwell up&nbsp;before it, and gives it a real motion alongiide of it in&nbsp;the oppoſite direction. And as the body expofid to a&nbsp;ſtream has a quantity of fluid almoſt ſtagnant both before and behind; ſo a body moved through a ſtill fluid&nbsp;carries before it and drags after it a quantity of fluid,&nbsp;which accompanies it with nearly an equal velocity.&nbsp;This addition to the quantity of matter in motion muſt&nbsp;make a diminution of its velocity ; and this forms a very&nbsp;conſiderable part of the obfirved reſiſtauce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we cannot, however, help remarking that it would require very diſtinct and ſtrong proof indeed to overturn the common opinion, which is founded on our moſt&nbsp;certain and ſxmple conceptions of motion, and on a law&nbsp;of nature to which we have never obferved an exception. Mr de Buat’s experiments, tho’ moſt judiciouſiy&nbsp;contrived, and executed with ſcrupulous care, are by no&nbsp;means of this kind. They were, of abſolute neceſſity,&nbsp;veιy complicated ; and many circumſtances, impoſſible to&nbsp;avoid or to appreciate, rendered the obfirvatiυn, or&nbsp;at leaſt the compariſon, of the velocities, veιy uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we can fie but two circumſtances which do not admit of an· eaſy or immediate compariſon in the two ſtates of the problem, when a body is expofid to a&nbsp;ftream </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">our experiments,</span><span class="font1"> in order to have an impulſe&nbsp;made on it, there is a force tending to move the body&nbsp;backwards, independent of the real impulſe or preffure&nbsp;occaſtoned by the deflection of the ftream. we cannot&nbsp;have a ſtream except in eonfiquence of a Hoping ſurface. Suppofe a body floating on this ſtrearti. It&nbsp;will not only fail down </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">along with the flream,</span><span class="font1"> but it&nbsp;will fail </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">down the flream,</span><span class="font1"> and will therefore go faſter&nbsp;along the canal than the ſtream does : for it is floating&nbsp;on an inclined plane ; and if we examine it by the laws&nbsp;of hydroſtatics, we ſliall find, that befides its own tendency to</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flide</span><span class="font1"> down this inclined plane, there is an odds&nbsp;of hydroſtatical preffure, which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pujhes</span><span class="font1"> it down this&nbsp;plane.
