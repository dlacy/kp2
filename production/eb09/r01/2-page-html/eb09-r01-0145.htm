<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">reigning duke entered into a treaty ־with the Protestant League. Treaties were about the same time made with&nbsp;France and Denmark, and it was evident that the new&nbsp;confederation would be able to oppose a resistance which&nbsp;even the resources of the empire might not be able to&nbsp;overcome. At this juncture another circumstance formed&nbsp;an appreciable element in the imperial calculations. All&nbsp;attempts at arriving at an understanding with the Turks&nbsp;had proved without result, and Solyman’s invasion of&nbsp;Hungary was imminent. At the advice of his brother,&nbsp;Charles accordingly condescended to treat with the members of the League, and in July 1532 the religious peace&nbsp;of Nuremberg afforded a temporary compromise, which it&nbsp;was provided should remain in force until a general council,&nbsp;of the character demanded by the Lutherans, was convened, or until the assembling of a new diet of the states&nbsp;of the empire. In the meantime the Lutherans were to&nbsp;be free from molestation and to be permitted to preach&nbsp;and publish the doctrines of the Confession of Augsburg.&nbsp;They were also to be left in possession of such church&nbsp;property as they still retained, and the jurisdiction of the&nbsp;courts of the empire in ecclesiastical questions was to be&nbsp;suspended. In return for these concessions the Leaguers&nbsp;pledged themselves to be loyal to the emperor, and to&nbsp;render aid both with money and men in the event of an&nbsp;invasion by the Turks. They likewise undertook not to&nbsp;afford protection either to the Anabaptists or to the&nbsp;followers of Zwingli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">t The great leader of the Reformation in Switzerland was *־׳ at this time no more. In the year 1531 the feud between&nbsp;' the Catholic and Protestant cantons had reached a climax;&nbsp;in the former the more bigoted section, aided by Ferdinand&nbsp;of Austria, had commenced an active persecution, and&nbsp;some of the Protestant preachers had been put to death,.&nbsp;In order to repel these aggressions a league was formed&nbsp;between Zurich, Strasburg, and the landgrave of Hesse,&nbsp;and Zwingli strongly advised that a combined attack&nbsp;should forthwith be made on their opponents in Lucerne&nbsp;and Schwyz, and freedom of conscience obtained by an&nbsp;armed demonstration. Divided counsels, however, prevailed ; and eventually Zurich was left to bear the brunt&nbsp;of the contest almost entirely alone. At the battle of&nbsp;Cappel (11th October 1531) Zwingli fell, and his followers&nbsp;sustained a defeat which, although they carried on a war&nbsp;of fierce retaliation, they were unable to retrieve, and a&nbsp;decided reaction in favour of Catholicism now set in.&nbsp;The death of (Ecolampadius took place soon after the&nbsp;battle of Cappel, and was followed in 1535 by that of&nbsp;Francis Kolb, the Bernese Reformer. The heroic end of&nbsp;Zwingli was a matter of exultation not only to his Catholic antagonists but even to Luther, who was ungenerous&nbsp;enough to class his brother Reformer with lawless fanatics&nbsp;like Miinzer,@@<sup>1</sup> and in a letter written in the following year&nbsp;even went so far as to warn Duke Albert of Prussia not to&nbsp;tolerate the followers of Zwingli within his territories.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>¡ss In Germany, on the other hand, the Reformation con-'־ tinued to progress. In 1533 Philip of Hesse, w<sup>r</sup>ho was&nbsp;subsidized by France, inflicted a severe defeat on Ferdinand, and was able shortly after to reinstate Ulrich, duke&nbsp;of Wiirtemberg, in his dominions. The emperor at the&nbsp;peace of Kadan (29th June 1534) undertook to abstain&nbsp;from further interference in the ecclesiastical affairs of the&nbsp;duchy, and the understanding arrived at on that occasion&nbsp;is regarded by Ranke as marking the second important&nbsp;stage in the history of the Reformation in Germany. The&nbsp;Reformed faith was forthwith established throughout Wiirt-emberg, and soon after was introduced into Holstein,&nbsp;Pomerania, the Mark of Brandenburg, Upper Saxony,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Brunswick, and the Palatinate. The League of Schmal-kald was thus strengthened by numerous and powerful accessions; among the number was King Francis himself,&nbsp;who, although he was repressing the Reformation movement with severity in his own dominions, saw liis advantage in siding with the Protestant princes against his chief&nbsp;enemy, the emperor. Henry VIII. declared himself also&nbsp;a supporter of the League. The city of Basel had already&nbsp;in 1534 put forth, independently, a new confession of&nbsp;faith, and this was followed in 1536 by a second, which&nbsp;received the approval of Luther and became known as the&nbsp;“ first Helvetic confession.” In order, however, still further&nbsp;to unite the Protestant party, with a view to a general&nbsp;council, Luther, in conjunction with other theologians from&nbsp;Saxony, Sw<sup>T</sup>abia, and Hesse, drew up and transmitted to&nbsp;the Lutheran representatives at Schmalkald in February&nbsp;1537 another confession. In this the doctrines contained&nbsp;in the Confession of Augsburg were reiterated, but in a&nbsp;far more uncompromising form. Luther denounced the&nbsp;pope as Antichrist and the mass as an abomination.&nbsp;Melanchthon declared himself unable to concur in this&nbsp;language, and in an additional article expressed his readiness to yield submission to the bishop of Rome as the&nbsp;highest dignitary in the church so soon as the latter should&nbsp;sanction really scriptural teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As elsewhere, the history of the Reformation in France is that of a twofold struggle,—an endeavour to bring about&nbsp;a reform of discipline, and a contest which pointed in the&nbsp;direction of doctrinal change. The abuses that prevailed&nbsp;in the Gallican Church at this period were scarcely less&nbsp;glaring than those in Germany. The appointments to the&nbsp;higher benefices were dictated solely by the most sordid&nbsp;motives,—political ambition, court favouritism, and family&nbsp;interest. Pluralism largely prevailed ; and both bishoprics&nbsp;and abbeys were granted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in commendam</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to such an extent&nbsp;that residence was almost unknown. Preferments were&nbsp;often bestowed upon laymen, and even upon females and&nbsp;children. Pierre de l’Estoile, writing of the middle of the&nbsp;16th century, states that the majority of the benefices in&nbsp;France were then held by persons who were by the canon&nbsp;law disqualified for their office. But in no country was&nbsp;the movement, that aimed at the correction of abuses such&nbsp;as these, more completely dissociated from the religious&nbsp;revolution contemplated by the Protestant leaders. In&nbsp;the first instance, the doctrines of Luther were favourably&nbsp;regarded by many of the nobility and of the episcopal&nbsp;order. The leader of the party which represented those&nbsp;doctrines was Lefèvre d’Étaples, whose translation of the&nbsp;New Testament into French appeared in the year 1522.&nbsp;In the year 1521, having been singled out by the Sorbonne&nbsp;for special attack as a teacher of the tenets which the&nbsp;university had just so emphatically condemned, he deemed&nbsp;it prudent, notwithstanding the encouragement he received&nbsp;from Francis, to retire to Meaux. Here, under the protection of Briçonnet, the eminent bishop of that diocese,&nbsp;he became the guiding genius of a movement which at one&nbsp;time seemed likely to transform Meaux into a second&nbsp;Wittenberg. This activity, however, was very early&nbsp;checked by the terrors of a commission. Lefèvre and his&nbsp;disciple Farel fled to Strasburg, the latter subsequently&nbsp;to Geneva, where his efforts founded the famous school of&nbsp;theology associated with the name of Calvin (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Calvin) ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Briçonnet, alarmed at the prospect of a schism which&nbsp;threatened to prove permanent, reverted to Catholicism,&nbsp;and even acquiesced in a policy of persecution in his own&nbsp;diocese. Both Francis I. and his sister ;Margaret, queen&nbsp;of Navarre, were at this time disposed to support the&nbsp;Reformation. When the Sorbonne condemned the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colloquies</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Erasmus (May 1526) Francis gave orders that&nbsp;24,000 copies should be printed and circulated throughout</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
