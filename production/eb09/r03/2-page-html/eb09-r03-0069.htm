            <p><span class="font1">The indifference of the city populace, to whom the prospect of
                    small holdings in a remote district of Italy was not a tempting one, was
                    overcome by the establishment of&nbsp;regular monthly doles of corn at a low
                        price.@@<sup>1</sup> Finally, the&nbsp;men of business—the publicans,
                    merchants, and moneylenders—were conciliated by the privilege granted to
                    them&nbsp;of collecting the tithes of the new province of Asia, and&nbsp;placed
                    in direct rivalry with the senate by the substitution&nbsp;of men of their own
                    class as judges in the “quaestio de&nbsp;repetundis,” in place of
                        senators.@@<sup>2</sup> The organizer of this&nbsp;concerted attack upon the
                    position of the senate fell, like&nbsp;his brother, in a riot.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The agrarian reforms of the two Gracchi had little permanent
                        effect.@@<sup>3</sup> Even in the lifetime of Gaius the clause in his
                    brother’s law rendering the new holdings inalienable&nbsp;was repealed, and the
                    process of absorption recommenced.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>In 118 a stop was put to
                    further allotment of occupied&nbsp;lands,@@<sup>5</sup> and finally, in 111, the
                    whole position of the agrarian question was altered by a law which converted
                    all&nbsp;land still held in occupation into private land.@@<sup>6</sup> The
                    old&nbsp;controversy as to the proper use of the lands of the community was
                    closed by this act of alienation. The controversy in future turns, not on the
                    right of the poor citizens&nbsp;to the state lands, but on the expediency of
                    purchasing&nbsp;other lands for distribution at the cost of the
                        treasury.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">But, though the agrarian reform failed, the political conflict it
                    had provoked ended only with the dictatorship&nbsp;of Cæsar, and the lines on
                    which it was waged were in&nbsp;the main those laid down by Gaius Gracchus. The
                    sovereignty of the assembly continued to be the watchword of&nbsp;the popular
                    party, and a free use of the tribunician&nbsp;powers of interference and of
                    legislation remained the&nbsp;most effective means of giving effect to their
                    aims. At&nbsp;the same time the careers of both Tiberius and Gaius
                    had&nbsp;illustrated the weak points of their position,—the uncertain temper and
                    varying composition of the assembly,&nbsp;the limited tenure of office enjoyed
                    by the tribunes@@<sup>8</sup> and&nbsp;the possibility of disunion in their own
                    body, and, lastly, the&nbsp;difficulty of keeping together the divergent
                    interests which&nbsp;Gaius had for a moment united in hostility to the
                    senate.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Ten years after the death of Gaius the populäres once more
                    summoned up courage to challenge the supremacy of&nbsp;the senate ; and it is
                    important as marking a step in&nbsp;advance that it was on a question not of
                    domestic reform&nbsp;but of foreign administration that the conflict was
                    renewed.&nbsp;The course of affairs in the client state of Numidia
                    since&nbsp;Micipsa’s death in 118 had been such as to discredit a&nbsp;stronger
                    government than that of the senate.@@<sup>9</sup> In open&nbsp;defiance of Roman
                    authority, and relying on the influence&nbsp;of his own well-spent gold,
                    Jugurtha had murdered both&nbsp;his legitimate rivals, Hiempsal and Adherbal,
                    and made&nbsp;himself master of Numidia. The declaration of

                <p><span class="font1">wrung from the senate (112) by popular indignation had been
                        followed by the corruption of a consul@@<sup>10</sup> (111) and&nbsp;the
                        crushing defeat of the proconsul Albinus.@@<sup>11</sup> On the&nbsp;news of
                        this crowning disgrace the storm burst, and on&nbsp;the proposal of the
                        tribunes a commission of inquiry was&nbsp;appointed into the conduct of the
                            war.@@<sup>12</sup> But the popular&nbsp;leaders did not stop here.
                        Cæcilius Metellus, who as consul (109) had succeeded to the command in
                        Numidia, was&nbsp;an able soldier but a rigid aristocrat ; and they
                        now&nbsp;resolved to improve their success by entrusting the command instead
                        to a genuine son of the people. Their&nbsp;choice fell on Gaius Marius (see
                        </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                        >Marius),</span><span class="font1"> an experienced&nbsp;officer and
                        administrator, but a man of humble birth,&nbsp;wholly illiterate, and one
                        who, though no politician, was&nbsp;by temperament and training a hater of
                        the polished and&nbsp;effeminate nobles who filled the
                            senate.@@<sup>13</sup> He was triumphantly elected, and, in spite of a
                        decree of the senate&nbsp;continuing Metellus as proconsul, he was entrusted
                        by a&nbsp;vote of the assembly with the charge of the war
                            against&nbsp;Jugurtha.@@<sup>14</sup></span></p>
                <p><span class="font1">Jugurtha was vanquished ; and Marius, who had been a second
                        time elected consul in his absence, arrived at Rome&nbsp;in January 104,
                        bringing the captive prince with him in&nbsp;chains.@@<sup>15</sup> But
                        further triumphs awaited the popular hero.&nbsp;The Cimbri and Teutones were
                        at the gates of Italy ; they&nbsp;had four times defeated the senatorial
                        generals, and&nbsp;Marius was called upon to save Rome from a
                        second&nbsp;invasion of the barbarians.@@<sup>16</sup> After two years of
                        suspense&nbsp;the victory at Aquæ Sextiæ (102), followed by that on
                        the&nbsp;Raudine plain (101), put an end to the danger by
                        the&nbsp;annihilation of the invading hordes; and Marius, now consul for the
                        fifth time, returned to Rome in triumph. There&nbsp;the popular party
                        welcomed him as a leader, and as one&nbsp;who would bring to their aid the
                        imperium of the consul&nbsp;and all the prestige of a successful general.
                        Once more,&nbsp;however, they were destined to a brief success
                        followed&nbsp;by disastrous defeat. Marius became for the sixth
                        time&nbsp;consul ;@@<sup>17</sup> of the two popular leaders Glaucia became
                        praetor&nbsp;and Saturninus tribune. But neither Marius nor his&nbsp;allies
                        were statesmen of the stamp of the Gracchi ; and&nbsp;the laws proposed by
                        Saturninus had evidently no other&nbsp;serious aim in view than that of
                        harassing the senate.&nbsp;His corn law merely reduced the price fixed in
                        123 for the&nbsp;monthly dole of corn, and the main point of his
                        agrarian&nbsp;law lay in the clause appended to it requiring all
                        senators&nbsp;to swear to observe its provisions.@@<sup>18</sup> The laws
                        were carried ;&nbsp;the senators with the exception of Metellus took the
                        oath ;&nbsp;but the triumph of the popular leaders was
                        short-lived.&nbsp;Their recklessness and violence had alienated all classes
                        in&nbsp;Rome ; and their period of office was drawing to a close.&nbsp;At
                        the elections fresh rioting took place, and at last&nbsp;Marius as consul
                        was called upon by the senate to protect&nbsp;the state against his own
                        partisans. In despair Saturninus&nbsp;and Glaucia surrendered, but while the
                        senate was discussing their fate they were surrounded and murdered
                        by&nbsp;the populace.</span></p>
                <p><span class="font1">The popular party had been worsted once more in their
                        struggle with the senate, but none the less their alliance&nbsp;with Marius,
                        and the position in which their votes placed&nbsp;him, marked an epoch in
                        the history of the revolution.</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
