<body><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">will be proportional to the fquares of the velocities directly, and to the chords of curvature haviag the direc-tion of the forces inverſely.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">From theſe premiſes, therefore, we deduce, jit the ſtricteſt manner, the demonſtration of the leading theo-<sub>r</sub>em of the reſiſtance and impulfe of fluids ; namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">cîProp. I. The refiſtances, and (by the third law of motion), the impulſions of fluids on ſimilar bodies, are proportional to the ſurfaces of the ſolid bodies, to the&nbsp;denſities of the fluids, and to the fquaιes of the velocities, jointly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We muſt now obferve, that when we ſuppofe the par-ticles of the fluid to be in mutual contact, we may ei-ther fuppoſe them elaſtic or unelaſtic. The motion communicated to the collection of elaſtic particles muſt&nbsp;be double of what the ſame body, moving in the ſame&nbsp;manner, would communicate to the particles of an unelaſtic fluid. The impnlſe and reſiſtance of elaſtic fluids&nbsp;muſt therefore be double of thoſe of unelaſtic fluids.—&nbsp;But we muſt caution our readers not to judge of the&nbsp;elaſticity oſ fluids by their ſenfible compreffibility. A&nbsp;diamond is incomparably more elaſtic than the ſineſt football, though not compreſſible in any fenfible degree.—&nbsp;It remains to be decided, by well choſen experiments,&nbsp;whether water be not as elaſtic as air. If we ſuppoſe,&nbsp;with Boſcovich, the particles of perfect fluids to be at&nbsp;a diſtance from each other, we ſſiall find it difficult to&nbsp;conceive a fluid void of elafticity. we hope that the&nbsp;theory of their impulſe and reſtſtance wiſl l'uggeſt experiments which wiſl decide this queſtion, by pointing&nbsp;out what ought to be the abſolute impulſe or reiiſtance&nbsp;in either caſe. And thus the fundamental propoſttion&nbsp;of the impulſe and reſiſtance of fluids, taken in its pro-per meaning, is ſufceptible of a rigid demonſtration, re-lative to the only diſtinct notion that we can form of the&nbsp;internal conſtitution of a fluid. We lay, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">taken in its&nbsp;proper meaning ;</span><span class="font1"> namely, that the impulſe or refiſtance of&nbsp;fluids is a preffure, oppoſed and meaſured by another&nbsp;preffure, ſuch as a pound weight, the force of a ſpring,&nbsp;the preffure of the atmoſphere, and the like. And we&nbsp;apprehend that it would he very difficult to find any&nbsp;legitimate demonftration of this leading propoſttion different from this, which we have now borrowed from&nbsp;Sir lſaac Newton, Prop. 23,. B. II. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Princip. We</span><span class="font1"> ac-knowledge that it is prolix and even circuitous : but&nbsp;in all the-attempts made by his commentators and their&nbsp;copyiſts to ſimplify it, we ſee great defects of logical&nbsp;argument, or affumption of principles, which are not&nbsp;only gratuitous, but inadmiſſible. we ſſiall have occa-ſion, as we proceed, to point out ſome of thefe defects ;&nbsp;and doubt not but the illuſtrious author of this demon-ſtration hadexercifed his uncommon patience and ſagacity&nbsp;in ſimilar attempts, and was diffatisſied with them aſl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before we proceed further, it vyill be proper to rn&gt;ke a general remark, which wiſl fave a great deal of&nbsp;diſcuſſion. Since it is a matter of univerfal experience,&nbsp;that every action of a body on others is accompanied by&nbsp;an equal and contrary re-action ; and ſince all that we&nbsp;can demonſtrate concerning the reſiſtance of bodies during their motions through fluids proceeds on this ſup-poſition, (the reſiſtance of ∣the body being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ajfumed</span><span class="font1"> as&nbsp;equal and oppoſite to the ſum of motions communicated&nbsp;to the particles of the fluid, eſtimated in the direction&nbsp;of the bodies motion), we are intitled to proceed in the&nbsp;contrary ordfer, and to conſider the impulſions which&nbsp;each of the particles of fluid exerts on the body at reſt,&nbsp;as equal and oppofite to the motion which the body&nbsp;would communicate to that particle if the fluid were at&nbsp;reſt, and the body were moving equaſly ſwift in the oppoſite direction. And therefore the whole impulſion&nbsp;of the fluid muſt be conceived as the meaſure of the whole&nbsp;motion which the body would thus communicate to the&nbsp;fluid. It muſt therefore be alſo conſidered as themeaſurcof&nbsp;the reſiſtance which the body, moving wiſh the ſame velocity, would ſuſtain from the fluid, when, therefore,&nbsp;we ſſiall demonſtrate any thing concerning the impulſion&nbsp;of a fluid, eſtimated in the direction of its motion, we&nbsp;muſt conſider it as demonſtrated concerning the refift=&nbsp;ance of a quieſcent fluid to the motion of that body,&nbsp;having the ſame velocity in the oppoſite direction. The&nbsp;determination of theſe impulſions being much eaſier&nbsp;than the determination of the motions communicated&nbsp;by the body to the particles oſ the ſiuid, this method&nbsp;wiſl be followed in moſt of the ſubſequent diſcuſſions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tlie general propofition already delivered is by no means ſuſſicient for explaining the various important&nbsp;phenomena obſerved in the mutual actions oſ ſolids and&nbsp;fluids. In particular, it gives us no aſſiſtance in aſcer-tainſhg ſhe modifications of this reſtſtance or impulfe,&nbsp;which depend on the ſhape of ſhe body and the ineli-nation of its impelled or reſiſted ſurface to the direction&nbsp;of the motion. Sir Iſaac Newton found another hypothefis neceffary ; namely, that the ſtuid ſhould be ſo&nbsp;extremely rare that the diſtance of the particles may be&nbsp;incomparably greater than their diameters. This addi-tional condition is neceſſary for conſidering their actions&nbsp;as ſo many ſeparate codifions or impuliι&lt;ans on the ſolid&nbsp;body. Each particle mnſt be ſuppoſed to have abundant room to rebound, or otherwiſe eſcape, after having&nbsp;made its ſtroke, without ſenfibly affecting the ſituations&nbsp;and motions of the particles which have not yet made&nbsp;their ftroke : and the motion mnſt be ſo ſwiſt as not&nbsp;to give time for the ſenſible exertion of their mutual&nbsp;forces of attractions and repulſions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keeping theſe conditions in mind, we may proceed to determine the impuliions made by a fluid on ſurfaces&nbsp;of every kind : And the mo⅛ convenient method to&nbsp;purſue in this determination, is to compare them all either with the inιpulfε which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fame Jurfiqce</span><span class="font1"> would receive from the fluid impinging on it perpendicularly, or&nbsp;with the impulſe which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fame fiream of fiuid</span><span class="font1"> would,&nbsp;make when coming perpendicularly on a ſurface of ſuch&nbsp;extent as to occupy the whole ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will greatly abbreviate-language, if we make uſe of a few terms in an appropriated ſenſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">3. fiream,</span><span class="font1"> we ſhall mean a quantity of ſiuid moving in one direction, that is, each particle moving in paral-lel lines ; and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">breadth</span><span class="font1"> of the ſtream is a line perpen-dicular to all theſe parallels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filament</span><span class="font1"> means a portion of this ſtream of very ſmall breadth, and it conſiſts of an indefinite number of&nbsp;particles following one another in the ſame direction,&nbsp;and ſucceſſively impinging on, or gliding alom&gt;-, the ſurface of the ſolid body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">baſe</span><span class="font1"> of any lurface'expofed to a. ſtream of ſiuid, is that portion of a plane perpendicular to the ſtream,&nbsp;which is covered or protected from the action of the&nbsp;ſtream by the furface expofed to its impulſe.
