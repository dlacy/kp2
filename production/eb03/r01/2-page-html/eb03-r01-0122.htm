<p><span class="font4">RESIGNATION, ill general, ſigniſies the implicit ſubmiſſion of ourſelves, or of ſomething we poffeſs,. to the will of another. In a religious ſenſe it ſignifies&nbsp;a perfect ſubmiſſion, without difcontent, to the will of&nbsp;God. See Moral Philosophy, n<sup>0</sup> 119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RESIN, in natural hiſtory, a viſcidjuice oozing either ſpontaneouſiy, or by inciſion, from ſeveral trees, as the&nbsp;pine, fir, &amp;c.— Â premium for ſeveral years has been offered by the London Society for Encouraging Arts,&nbsp;&amp;c. for difcovering a mode of reducing the inflammable&nbsp;quality of refin, ſo as to adapt it to the purpofes of making candles; but no ſuch diſcovery has yet been madc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gum Resin,</span><span class="font4"> a mixture of gum and refin. See Phar∙ Macy, n<sup>0</sup> 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Red Gum </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resin,</span><span class="font4"> is procured from the red gum tree, or eucalyptus refinifera ; a tree ſo large and lofty as to&nbsp;exceed in fize the Engliih oak. The wood of the tree&nbsp;is brittle, and of little uſe but for firewood, from the&nbsp;large quantity of refinous gum it contains. The tree&nbsp;is diſtinguiſhed by having pedunculated flowers, and an&nbsp;acute or pointed conical calyptra. To obtain the juice&nbsp;from this tree incitions are made in the trunk of it,&nbsp;and ſometimes upwards oſ 60 gallons of red refinous&nbsp;juice have been obtained from one of them. &quot; when&nbsp;this juice is dried, it becomes a very powerful aſtringent gum-refin, of a red colour, much reſerabling that&nbsp;known in the ſhops by the name of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">kino,</span><span class="font4"> and, for all&nbsp;medical purpoſes, fully as efficacious. Mr white ad-miniſtered it to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">great number of patients in the dy-ſentery, which prevailed much ſoon after the landing&nbsp;©f the convicts, and in no one inſtance found it to fail.&nbsp;This gum-refin diffolves almoſt entirely in ſpirit of&nbsp;wine, to which it gives a blood-red tincture, water&nbsp;diſtblves about one fixth part only, and the watery folu-tion is cf a bright red. Both theſe ſolutions are powerfully aſtringent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fellow Gum </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resin,</span><span class="font4"> is procured from the yellow re-ſin tree, which is as large as the Engliſh walnut tree. The properties of this r.efin are equal to thoſe of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font4">moſt fragrant balſams. It exudes from </span><span class="font1">the bark ſperi-</span><span class="font4">taneouſly, but more readily if incitions are made. The colour of it is yellow, and at firſt it is ſtuid ; but after&nbsp;being inſpiffated in the ſun, it becomes ſolid. When&nbsp;burnt on hot coals, it ſmells like a mixture of balſam&nbsp;of Tolu and benzoin, approaching ſomewhat to ſtorax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; It is perfectly ſoluble in ſpirit of wine, but not in water, nor even in effential oil of turpentine, unlels it be digeſted in a ſtrong heat. The varniſh which it makes&nbsp;with either is very weak, and of little uſe. with re-fpect to its medicinal qualities, Mr white has found,&nbsp;it, in many caſes, a good pectoral medicine, and very&nbsp;balfamιc. It is not obtainable in io great abundance as&nbsp;the red gum produced by the eucalyptus refinifera.&nbsp;The plant which produces the yellow gum ſeems to be&nbsp;perfectly unknown to botaniſts, but Mr white has communicated no ſpecimens by which its genus or even&nbsp;claſs could be determined.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RESINOUS electricity, is that kind of electricity which is produced by exciting bodies of the re-iinous kind, and which is generally negative.

<p><span class="font4">RESISTANCE, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resisting</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Force,</span><span class="font4"> in philoſophy, denotes, in general,- any power which acts in an oppofite direction to another, ſo as to deſtroy or diminiſh its effect. See Mechanics, Hydrostatics,&nbsp;and Pneumatics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gf all the refiſtances of bodies to each, there is undoubtedly noue of greater importance than the refiſtance or reaction of fluids. It is here that we muſt look for a theory of naval architecture,, for the&nbsp;impulſe of the air is our moving power, and this muſt&nbsp;be modified ſo as to produce every motion we want&nbsp;by the form and diſpofition of our fails ; and&nbsp;it is the refiſtance of the water which muſt be overcome, that the ſhip may proceed in her courſe ; and&nbsp;this muſt alſo be modified to our purpoſe, that the ſhip&nbsp;may not drive like a log to leeward, but on ∣he contrary may ply to windward, that ſhe may anſwer her&nbsp;helm briſkly, and that ſhe may be eaſy in all her motions on the ſurface of the troubled ocean. The im-pulſe of wind and water makes them ready and inde-fatigable ſervants in a thouſand ſhapes for driving our&nbsp;machines ; and we ſhould lofe much of their ſervice&nbsp;did we remain ignorant of the laws of their action :&nbsp;they would ſometimes become terrible maſters, if we&nbsp;did not fall upon methods of eluding or ſoftening their&nbsp;attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">we cannot refuſe the ancients a confiderable knowledge of this ſnbject. It was equally intereſting to them as to us ; and we cannot read the accounts of the naval&nbsp;exertions of Phoenicia, Carthage, and of Rome, exertions&nbsp;which have not been ſurpaffed hy any thing of modern&nbsp;date, without believing that they poffeffed much practical and experimental knowledge of this ſubject. It&nbsp;was not, perhaps, poffeffed by them in a ſtrict and&nbsp;ſyftematic form, as it is now taught by our mathema-ticians; but the maſter-builders, in their dockyards, did&nbsp;undoubtedly exerciſe their genius in comparing the&nbsp;forms of their ſtneſt ſhips, and in. marking thoſe circumſtances of form and dimenſton which were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in fa£t&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">accompanied with the deſirable properties of a ſhip,&nbsp;and thus framing to themſelves maxims of naval architecture in the fame xnanncr as we do now.
