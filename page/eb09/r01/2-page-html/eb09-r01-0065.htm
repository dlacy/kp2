<p><span class="font1">to and from the north-eastern Atlantic States north of the Potomac. The eastern “trunk lines,” as they are called, extending from the&nbsp;west to the north-eastern seaports (and also to Canada), have a&nbsp;heavier goods traffic than any other lines of considerable length&nbsp;in the world. The companies owning these lines also own or control in some way extensive systems reaching as far west as Chicago,&nbsp;and in several cases to the Mississippi at St Louis. Two great&nbsp;systems centre on the Pacific coast. Chicago is the chief traffic&nbsp;centre of the interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The railways having at first to serve a thinly peopled but rapidly growing country, American engineers devised methods of construction and working which produced a line at very small cost, lacking&nbsp;very many of the appliances considered necessary in Europe, but&nbsp;capable of being extended and developed as the country itself became more settled and prosperous. At first many Unes cost only&nbsp;£2000 per mile, and much better lines are now being built for&nbsp;£3000 per mile or less. Even when fully developed they are still&nbsp;usually very much less costly than European railways. Some of&nbsp;the large systems have cost, on the average, only from £7000 to&nbsp;£3000 per mile. The average reported cost in 1884 of the 125,000&nbsp;miles of railway in the United States was £11,400 per mile ; but&nbsp;the actual average cost is probably much less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States coal for fuel and timber for building and other purposes are carried by railway 1500 miles or more from the&nbsp;place of production. Cattle are carried 2000 miles and more, and&nbsp;wheat and other grains worth but half as much per ton, in immense&nbsp;quantities, 1500 to 1800 miles. This is possible only by rates&nbsp;which in most countries would be thought ruinously low. But in&nbsp;recently settled parts of the United States the population are often&nbsp;dependent upon the railway for almost everything they consume ;&nbsp;and almost everything they produce, except their bread and meat,&nbsp;has to be carried by the same means. Thus the traffic per inhabitant is very much larger than in most old countries. Hence too&nbsp;manufactured goods can often be carried 1000 or 1500 miles at a&nbsp;cost very little more than that at the place of manufacture or&nbsp;importation. In one year the five eastern trunk lines received at&nbsp;their western termini (about 450 miles from New York) for transportation eastwards 8,200,000 tons of goods, equal to more than&nbsp;26,000 tons daily. This has greatly promoted the formation of&nbsp;large railway systems and the construction of branches and extensions by railway companies near unsettled districts. A company&nbsp;with a line 500 miles long is induced to make extensions not only&nbsp;by the profit to be made on the new line, which in a new country&nbsp;may be almost nothing for several years, but also by the profit&nbsp;made by carrying the traffic of the new line over the 500 miles of&nbsp;old railway. Comparing the traffic per inhabitant in the United&nbsp;States, Germany, and Austria-Hungary in 1883, we get (Table&nbsp;XXXIV.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The railways of America have enjoyed great liberty in fixing their rates, which, however, have been somewhat restricted by new legislation in several States since 1870, notably one limiting the New&nbsp;York Central to 2 cents (1d.) per mile for all classes of passengers.&nbsp;The average rates for goods have been reduced very much since the&nbsp;Civil War and even since 1875.

<p><span class="font1">The classification of passengers is but little developed in America. For local journeys there are usually but one class and one rate of&nbsp;fare ; but on several important lines additional charges are made&nbsp;for certain special kinds of accommodation. Railway “wars”&nbsp;often bring down the through fares to a ridiculously low figure :&nbsp;for instance, the first-class fare for 960 miles, New York to Chicago,&nbsp;has been £2 or less, and the immigrant fare during the spring and&nbsp;summer of 1884 was 4s. The rates on goods are innumerable and&nbsp;are often changed. Table XXXVII. gives examples of the great&nbsp;fluctuations in these rates, the figures being the number of cents&nbsp;per 100 lb of first-class (the highest class) freight :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The rates which the railways have endeavoured to maintain on this traffic since 1877 have been, with but slight changes, 75 cents&nbsp;for first-class freight, 60 for second, 45 for third, 35 for fourth,&nbsp;and 25 cents for fifth. The highest of these is at the rate of 1</span><span class="font0">∙</span><span class="font1">644&nbsp;cents per American ton per mile ( = 0</span><span class="font0">∙</span><span class="font1">92d. per English ton per mile) ;&nbsp;the lowest is 0</span><span class="font0">∙</span><span class="font1">548 cent ( = 0<sup>-</sup>307d.) The “basis rate” is that on&nbsp;grain and flour from Chicago to New York,—grain, flour, and meats&nbsp;forming about four-fifths of the whole traffic eastwards. Twenty&nbsp;cents ( = 0</span><span class="font0">∙</span><span class="font1">492 cent or 0<sup>-</sup>275d. per ton per mile) is considered a&nbsp;remunerative rate. Another “basis rate” is that from Chicago&nbsp;south-west to Kansas City, which governs rates from places about&nbsp;500 miles from Chicago west and south-west. This rate is usually&nbsp;nearly the same as that from Chicago north-west to St Paul, 400&nbsp;miles, governing a large amount of traffic in that direction. Between&nbsp;the Missouri river and the Pacific coast is another territory with&nbsp;another basis ; and in the south, rates from the Atlantic ports to&nbsp;inland towns are governed by one general rule, as also those from&nbsp;places in the upper Mississippi valley (like St Louis, Chicago,&nbsp;Cincinnati, and Louisville) to the same or other interior towns of&nbsp;the south. Traffic is facilitated on the longer routes by organizations known as “fast freight lines,” whose cars run over several&nbsp;connecting railways. When first established these lines were independent corporations, owning their cars, collecting the charges for&nbsp;transportation, and paying dividends out of their profits. Nowall&nbsp;but a few are simply co-operative agencies of the several associated&nbsp;railway companies, which contribute cars in certain agreed proportions, and share the expenses of the joint agencies, each company receiving the earnings for the freight passing over its railway&nbsp;precisely as for any through freight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The laws governing the formation of railway corporations and authorizing railway construction differ in different States, but in&nbsp;most it is open to any association of men with the necessary capital&nbsp;to form a company and construct a railway anywhere. Generally&nbsp;the laws relating to raising and extending capital and the disposition of income are very lax, and under them great abuses have&nbsp;occurred. All but a very small number of the railways have been&nbsp;projected and constructed by private enterprise ; but many companies have received aid from towns, cities, counties, or States, and&nbsp;the Federal Government and the State of Texas (the only State&nbsp;owning the public land within its borders) have subsidized many&nbsp;railways, mostly west of the Mississippi, by immense grants of&nbsp;public lands, in the aggregate amounting to 200,000,000 acres.&nbsp;The' Federal Government also lent its bonds to the amount of&nbsp;£13,000,000 to aid in the construction of a few lines between the&nbsp;Missouri and the Pacific coast. Between 1830 and 1840 several&nbsp;States undertook to construct railways on their own account ; but&nbsp;most of these attempts ended in disaster, and the railways were&nbsp;completed by companies, if completed at all. There remain, however, two State railways, one 138 miles long owned by Georgia,&nbsp;which it leases to a corporation for working, and the other by&nbsp;Massachusetts, mostly in the long Hoosac tunnel. Owing to the&nbsp;pernicious system of raising capital for railway construction from&nbsp;the sale of bonds, secured only by the property bought by the&nbsp;proceeds, before the end of 1874 108 railway companies were insolvent, and interest was unpaid on more than £100,000,000&nbsp;($497,807,660) of mortgage bonds which they had issued. Indeed,&nbsp;of the total nominal railway capital of the United States very&nbsp;nearly one-half is represented by bonds. One great company&nbsp;which has paid dividends for many years has £9,500,000 of stock&nbsp;to £20,000,000 of debt. The management of railway companies&nbsp;in the United States is often autocratic to the last degree. When&nbsp;once directors have been elected by the vote of the majority of the&nbsp;shareholders, they take the most important steps without ever consulting the shareholders, and in their annual reports they give only&nbsp;such information as they please, subject to no examination by independent auditors. This state of things naturally leads to grave&nbsp;abuses, to directoral mismanagement and dishonest speculation in&nbsp;bonds and shares. In some cases, however, the authority of the&nbsp;directors is limited by the charter or constitution of the company.</span></p>
