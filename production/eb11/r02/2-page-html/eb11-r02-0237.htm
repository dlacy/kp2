<p><span class="font1">There have, from time to time, been made experiments of a similar nature, notably by Tennyson, but rhyme has retained its sway as&nbsp;an essential ornament of all English poetry' which is not in blank&nbsp;verse. There have been not a few poems composed, principally&nbsp;in the nineteenth century, in rhymeless hexameters, and even the&nbsp;elegiac couplet has been attempted. The experiments of Longfellow, Clough, Kingsley and others demand respectful notice, but&nbsp;it is more than doubtful whether any one of these, even the mellifluous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromeda</span><span class="font1"> of the last-named writer, is really in harmony&nbsp;with the national prosody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Germany </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">very determined attack on rhyme </span><span class="font0">was </span><span class="font2">made early in the seventeenth century, particularly by a group of&nbsp;aesthetic critics in the Swiss universities. They attacked&nbsp;rhyme as an artless species of sing-song, which deadened and&nbsp;destroyed the true movement of melody in the rhythm. The&nbsp;argument of this group of critics had a deep influence in German&nbsp;practice, and led to the composition of a vast number of works&nbsp;in unrhymed measures, in few of which, however, is now found&nbsp;a music which justifies the experiment. Lessing recalled the&nbsp;German poets to a sense of the beauty and value of rhyme, but&nbsp;the popularity of Klopstock and his imitators continued to&nbsp;exercise a great influence. Goethe and Schiller, without&nbsp;abandoning rhyme altogether, permitted themselves a great&nbsp;liberty in the employment of unrhymed measures and in imitation of classic metres. This was carried to still greater lengths&nbsp;by Platen and Heine, the rhymeless rhythm of the last of whom&nbsp;was imitated in English verse by Matthew Arnold and others,&nbsp;not without an occasional measure of success. In France, on&nbsp;the other hand, the empire of rhyme has always been triumphant,&nbsp;and in French literature the idea of rhymeless verse can scarcely&nbsp;be said to exist. There the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rime pleine</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">riche,</span><span class="font2"> in which not&nbsp;merely the sound but the emphasis is perfectly identical, is&nbsp;insisted upon, and a poet who rhymed as Mrs Browning did,&nbsp;or made “ flying ” an equivalent in sound to “ ZionJ” would be&nbsp;deemed illiterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In French, two species of rhyme are accepted, the feminine and the masculine. Feminine rhymes are those which end in a&nbsp;mute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font1"> masculine those which do not so.end. The Alexandrine,&nbsp;which is the classical metre in French, is built up on what are known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rimes croisées,</span><span class="font1"> that is to say a couplet of masculine rhymes followed&nbsp;by a couplet of feminine, and that again by masculine. This rule&nbsp;is unknown to the medieval poetry of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Italian literature the excessive abundance and facility of rhyme has led to a rebellion against its use, which is much more&nbsp;reasonable than that of the Germans, whose strenuous language&nbsp;seems to call for an emphatic uniformity of sound. But it was&nbsp;the’influence of German aesthetics which forced upon the notice&nbsp;of Leopardi the possibility of introducing rhymeless lyrical&nbsp;measures into Italian verse, an innovation which he carried out&nbsp;with remarkable hardihood and success. The rhymeless odes&nbsp;of Carducci are also worthy of admiration, and may be compared by the student with those of Heine and of Matthew Arnold&nbsp;respectively. Nevertheless, in Italian also, the ear demands the&nbsp;pleasure of the full reiterated sound, and the experiments of the&nbsp;eminent poets who have rejected it have claimed respect rather&nbsp;than sympathy or imitation. At the close of the 19th century,&nbsp;particularly in France, where the rules of rhyme had been most&nbsp;rigid, an effort to modify and minimise these restraints was&nbsp;widely made. There is no doubt that the laws of rhyme, like&nbsp;other artificial regulations, may be too severe, but there is no&nbsp;evidence that the natural beauty which pure rhyme introduces&nbsp;into poetry is losing its hold on the human ear or is in any real&nbsp;danger of being superseded by accent or rhythm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RHYMNEY, an urban district in the western parliamentary division of Monmouthshire, England, on the borders of Glamorganshire, 22 m. N. by W. of Cardiff, on the Rhymney, the London&nbsp;&amp; North-Western, and the Brecon &amp; Merthyr railways. Pop.&nbsp;(1901), 7915. The Rhymney river, in the upper valley of which&nbsp;this town lies, forms almost throughout its course, to the&nbsp;estuary of the Severn near Cardiff, the boundary between&nbsp;England and Wales (Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In its upper part the valley, like others adjacent and parallel to it, is populous with mining townships, and the town of Rhymney&nbsp;owes its importance to the neighbouring coal-mines and to its&nbsp;iron and steel works, which employ nearly the whole population.&nbsp;The works of the Rhymney Iron Company, including blast&nbsp;furnaces and rolling mills, are among the largest of the kind in&nbsp;England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHYOLITE (Gr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ρ£ν,</span><span class="font2"> to flow, because of the frequency with which they exhibit fluxion structures), the group name of&nbsp;a type of volcanic rock, occurring mostly as lava flows, and&nbsp;characterized by a highly acid composition. They arc the most&nbsp;siliceous of all lavas, and, with the exception of the dacitcs, are&nbsp;the only lavas which contain free primary quartz. In chemicaI&nbsp;composition they very closely resemble the granites which are&nbsp;the corresponding rocks of plutonic or deep-seated origin; their&nbsp;minerals also present many points of similarity to those of&nbsp;granite though they are by no means entirely the same. Quartz,&nbsp;orthoclase and plagioclase felspars, and biotite are the commonest ingredients of both rocks, but the quartz of rhyolites&nbsp;is full of glass enclosures and the potash felspar is pellucid&nbsp;sanidine, while the quartz of granite contains dust-Iikc fluid&nbsp;cavities of very minute size and its potash felspar is of the&nbsp;turbid variety which is properly called orthoclase. The granites&nbsp;also are holocrystalline, while in the rhyolites there are usually&nbsp;porphyritic crystals floating in a fine ground-mass. Rhyolites&nbsp;have also been called Iiparites because many of the lavas of the&nbsp;Lipari Islands are excellent examples of this group. Above all&nbsp;rocks they have a disposition to assume vitreous forms, as when&nbsp;fused they crystallize with great difficulty. THence it has long&nbsp;baffled experimenters to produce rhyolite synthetically by&nbsp;fusion; it is stated that these difficulties have now been overcome, but geologists believe that the presence of steam and’other&nbsp;gases in the natural state expedites crystallization. In crucibles&nbsp;these cannot be retained at the temperatures employed; when&nbsp;the rocks are melted the gases escape and on cooling a pure&nbsp;glass is formed. The vitreous forms of rhyolite are known as&nbsp;obsidian, perlite and pumice (çç.r.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The minerals of the first generation, or phenocrysts, of rhyolite are generally orthoclase, oligoclase, quartz, biotite, augite or hornblende. The felspars are usually glassy clear, small, but of well-developed crystalline form: the potash felspar is sanidine, usually&nbsp;Carlsbad twinned ; the soda-lime felspar is almost always oligoclase,&nbsp;with characteristic polysynthetic structure. Both ot these may&nbsp;be corroded and irregular in their outlines; their cleavage and&nbsp;twinning then distinguish them readily from quartz. Glass enclosures, sometimes rectangular with small immobile bubbles, are&nbsp;frequent. The quartz occurs as blebs or sub-rounded grains, which&nbsp;are corroded double hexagonal pyramids. Its glass enclosures are&nbsp;many and nearly always rounded or elliptical in section. No proper&nbsp;cleavage is seen in the quartz, though arcuate (conchoidal) fractures&nbsp;may. often be noticed ; they, may have, been produced by strain on&nbsp;cooling. Phenocrysts of micropegmatite are known in some rhyolites; they may have the shape of felspar or of quartz crystals;&nbsp;in the former case Carlsbad twinning is by no means uncommon,&nbsp;but in other cases hour-glass structure is very conspicuous. Biotite&nbsp;is always deep brown or greenish brown, in small hexagonal tabjets,&nbsp;generally blackened at their edges by magmatic corrosion. Muscovite is not known in rhyolites. Hornblende may be green or&nbsp;brown ; in the quartz-pantellaritcs it sometimes, takes, the form of&nbsp;strongly pleochroic brown cossyrite. Like biotite it is eumorphic&nbsp;but often corroded in a marked degree. Augite, which, is equally&nbsp;common or more common than the other ferro-magnesian minerals,&nbsp;is always green; its crystals are small and perfectly shaped, and&nbsp;corrosion phenomena are very rarely seen in it. . Zircon, apatite&nbsp;and magnetite are always present in rhyolites, their crystals being&nbsp;often beautifully perfect though never large. Olivine is never a&nbsp;normal ingredient, but occurs in the hollow SpheruIites or Iitho-physae of some rhyolites with garnet, tridymite, topaz and other&nbsp;minerals which indicate pneumatolytic action. Amonç the less&nbsp;common accessory minerals of the rhyolites are cordierite in crystals&nbsp;which resemble hexagonal prisms but break up under polarized&nbsp;light into six radiating sectors owing to complicated twinning:&nbsp;they weather to green aggregates of chlorite and muscovite (pinitej ;&nbsp;garnet, sphene and orthite may also be met with in rhyolites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ground-mass of rhyolitic rocks is of three distinct types which are stages in crystalline development, viz. the vitreous,&nbsp;the felsitic or cryptocrystalline, and the microcrystalline.&nbsp;Hence some authorities have proposed to subdivide the group</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
