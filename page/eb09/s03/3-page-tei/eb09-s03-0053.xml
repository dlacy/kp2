Many more passages might be quoted from writers of this period testifying to the belief that the hill that witnessed the offering of Isaac witnessed also the resurrection of Christ, and many others identifying the scene of the offering of Isaac with the hill on which the temple was built. Perhaps the strongest point in this connexion against Fergusson is that so striking a fact as the identity of the hill of the Passion with that on part of which the temple stood should only be directly spoken to by a single writer. After the 9th century the historical evidence becomes more difficult to interpret. Fergusson would date the transference of the site about 1000 ; but it seems clear from Istakhri (9 7 8) @@<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> and Mokaddasi (987), @@<hi rend="superscript">21 </hi>both of whom were unknown to him, that before their days the Dome of the Rock was a Mohammedan place of worship, and the latter expressly states that it was suggested by a great Christian church. @@<hi rend="superscript">22</hi> The natural date to assign for such a transference would be about 614, when the city was captured by the Persians, and, to quote the carefully guarded narrative of Gibbon, “ the sepulchre of Christ and the stately churches of Helena and Constantine were consumed, or at least damaged, by the flames.” The buildings were repaired or rebuilt by Modestus a few years later, and their praises are sung by Sophronius, his successor in the patriarchate, but in terms which give little topographical information. Sophronius lived to see the capture of the city by Omar in 636, the earliest records of whose doings as yet available are the brief one of Theophanes (818) and the more lengthened one of Eutychius (937). From both of these it seems clear that the caliph confirmed the Christians in the possession of the sites (whatever these might be) which he found in their hands. In or about 670 the French bishop Arculph visited Jerusalem, and under the hand of Adamnanus we have a detailed account taken down from his lips, @@<hi rend="superscript">23</hi> and a plan of the church of the Resurrection as he saw it, which strikingly corresponds to the Dome of the Rock,—as, however, it necessarily would correspond with any church which had been erected in close imitation of that building. @@<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> There are passages, however, in Arculph descriptive of the city very difficult to understand unless on the assumption that the transference of Sion, which had hitherto (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerusalem)</hi> been identified with the eastern hill, had already in his time taken place.

In it the construction of the dome of the building is dated 72 A.H. (691), but the name of the builder, which clearly was Abd-el- Melek in the original, has been erased and that of Abdallah el-Mamun (198 A.H. ; 813) fraudulently substituted, “the short-sighted forger,” as Palmer calls him, having omitted to change the date as well as the name. In this inscription there is very special mention made of our Saviour, and in a way which seems inexplicable unless the building on which it was inscribed had been, in the mind of the writer, associated in some important respects with the history of Jesus. And the tradition that it was so continued long after ; for we find Theoderic so late as 1176 writing of it, “Hoc templum, quod nunc videtur, ad honorem Domini nostri Jesu Christi ejusque piæ genetricis ab Helena regina et ejus filio, imperatore Constantino, constructum est ” (ed. Tobler, St Gall, 1865, p. 46). Fergusson believes this inscription to have been written in the 12th century, but is obliged to admit that the alphabet employed is identical with that found on the coins of Abd-el-Melek <hi rend="italic">( Temples of the Jews,</hi> p. 24).
