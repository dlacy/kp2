<p><span class="font1">into a drinking-cup. Vladimir, the son of Sviatoslaff, was for some time a monster of cruelty and debauchery. He&nbsp;killed his brother Yaropolk, and seized his dominions ; and,&nbsp;Yaropolk having some time before murdered his brother&nbsp;Oleg, Vladimir now became sole ruler. To his hereditary&nbsp;dominions he added Galicia or Red Russia, and subjugated&nbsp;some Lithuanian and Livonian tribes. Suddenly he seems&nbsp;to have been troubled with religious difficulties. According to the chronicler, he sent ambassadors to bring him&nbsp;reports of the different religions—Catholic, Jewish, Mussulman, and Greek. The last of these beliefs seemed the&nbsp;most satisfactory. Vladimir marched south, took the city&nbsp;of Chersonesus in the Crimea, which at that time belonged&nbsp;to the Byzantine emperors, and then sent to demand the&nbsp;hand of the daughter of that potentate. After some&nbsp;deliberation his request was granted on condition that he&nbsp;was baptized. Accordingly he went to Constantinople in&nbsp;988, and was admitted into the church, and at the same&nbsp;time received the hand of Anne, the Byzantine princess,&nbsp;although he seems to have already had a great number of&nbsp;wives. On his return to Kieff, he caused the image of&nbsp;Perun, the Slavonic god of thunder, which had been&nbsp;erected on an eminence, to be cast into the river, after&nbsp;having been belaboured by the cudgels of his soldiers.&nbsp;After this Vladimir issued a proclamation ordering all the&nbsp;inhabitants to proceed on the following day to the banks&nbsp;of the river to receive baptism. This extraordinary command met with universal obedience, and Russia was&nbsp;Christianized. As Vladimir introduced Christianity into&nbsp;Russia, so Yaroslaff his son was the first legislator. He&nbsp;was prince of Novgorod, and died in 1054. Vladimir on&nbsp;his death divided his dominions among his sons :—to&nbsp;Yaroslaff, Novgorod; to Iziaslaff, Polotsk; to Boris, Rostoff ;&nbsp;to Gleb, Murom ; to Sviatoslaff, the Drevlians ; and a few&nbsp;other provinces to others of his sons. Kieff, his capital,&nbsp;was seized by his nephew Sviatopolk, who murdered Boris&nbsp;and Gleb, now canonized among the martyrs of the&nbsp;Russian Church. Yaroslaff at length drove Sviatopolk&nbsp;from Kieff, and was temporarily restored by the Poles, but&nbsp;only to be driven out again, and he ended his life as an&nbsp;exile. Yaroslaff was successful against the Petchenegs, but&nbsp;failed in an attack on Constantinople. His great claim to&nbsp;be remembered lies in his publishing the first recension of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Russkaia Pravda,</span><span class="font1"> the earliest Russian code, which&nbsp;was handed down in the chronicles of Novgorod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We now leave the earliest period of Russian history, with its romantic stories and embedded sagas, telling us&nbsp;of heroic men, for the second division of our subject. The&nbsp;death of Yaroslaff was followed by the dreariest portion&nbsp;of the Russian annals—the period of the apanages (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">udieli</span><span class="font1">),&nbsp;lasting from 1054 to 1238. The country was now broken&nbsp;up into petty principalities, and we shall understand its&nbsp;condition more clearly if we remember that the chief&nbsp;divisions of Russia from the Ilth century to the 13th&nbsp;were as follows @@<sup>1</sup> :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principality of Smolensk, formerly of great importance,&nbsp;as including in its territories the sources of three of the great&nbsp;Russian rivers—the Volga, the Dnieper, and the Diina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principality of Russia, in the early and restricted sense,&nbsp;the original element of the country. The first form of the name is&nbsp;Rous. The word appears to have been a collective appellation of&nbsp;the people ; it was under the influence of the Byzantine writers&nbsp;that in the 17th century the form Rossia sprang up, which in time&nbsp;spread over the whole land. We must not forget, however, that&nbsp;to the majority of Englishmen, till the beginning of the 18th century, its name was Muscovy. Its situation on the Dnieper was very&nbsp;advantageous ; and the soil was fertile, the black-earth region being&nbsp;at the present time the great wheat-growing district of Russia.&nbsp;Besides, the Byzantine territory was not far oft. On the principality of Kieff depended that of Pereiaslavl ; and Vishgorod, Biel-gorod, and Tortchesk were made apanages for princes of the same&nbsp;dynasty.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> See Rambaud, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la Russie,</span><span class="font0"> p. 76.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the affluents of the right bank of the Dnieper, especially&nbsp;the Sozha, the Desna, and the Seim, stretched the principalities&nbsp;of Tchernigoffwith Staroduband Lubech, and Novgorod Severski&nbsp;with Putivl, Kursk, and Briansk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double principality of Ryazan and Murom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principality of Suzdal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The republics of Novgorod and Pskoff, and the daughter-city&nbsp;of the latter, Vyatka.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Iziaslaff, the son of Yaroslaff, seems to have had a troubled reign of twenty-four years, constantly disturbed&nbsp;by civil wars. On his death in 1078, although he had&nbsp;two sons, he left the principality of Kieff to his brother&nbsp;Vsevolod, apparently on a principle common among the&nbsp;Slavs to bequeath the crown to the oldest male of the&nbsp;family; but, on the death of Vsevolod, Sviatopolk, the&nbsp;son of Iziaslaff, succeeded in 1093. At his death&nbsp;Vladimir Monomakh came to the throne, and ruled from&nbsp;1113 to 1125. He was the son of Vsevolod, and was called&nbsp;after his maternal grandfather, the Byzantine emperor&nbsp;Constantine DIonomachus. The reign of this prince was&nbsp;a very prosperous one. He left a curious treatise&nbsp;called “ Instruction ” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pouchenie),</span><span class="font1"> addressed to his sons, in&nbsp;which we get a picture of the simple life in Russia at that&nbsp;period (see below, p. 103). He also founded on the river&nbsp;Kliazma a town which bears his name. There were continual quarrels among his descendants, but it is impossible&nbsp;to go into these minutely here. George Dolgoruki, one of&nbsp;the sons of Vladimir Monomakh, gained possession of Kieff&nbsp;in 1157, but the city soon began to pale before the growing&nbsp;power of Suzdal, and ceased to be the capital. He died&nbsp;the same year, just while a league was being formed to&nbsp;drive him out of it. The confederates entered the city,&nbsp;and their chief made himself prince. In 1169 Andrew&nbsp;Bogolioubski, son of George Dolgoruki, formed a coalition against Mstislaff, who was reigning in Kieff, and a&nbsp;large army was sent against the city. It was taken and&nbsp;pillaged ; and the sacred pictures, sacerdotal ornaments,&nbsp;and even bells were carried off. It is on this occasion&nbsp;that the head of St Clement, the Slavonic apostle, which&nbsp;is known to have been preserved at Kieff, was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the fall of this city Russia ceased for some time to have any political centre. During the fifty-four years&nbsp;previous to the arrival of the Mongols, our chief interest&nbsp;is drawn to Suzdal and Galicia, and the republics of&nbsp;Novgorod and Pskoff. George Dolgoruki had founded&nbsp;the principality of Suzdal ; his great anxiety, however,&nbsp;was to make himself master of Kieff. The chief aim of&nbsp;his son Andrew Bogoliubski was to extend his authority&nbsp;in another direction, and to cause it to be recognized at&nbsp;Novgorod the Great, where he had established his nephew&nbsp;as a kind of lieutenant. He attacked the city in 1170,&nbsp;but was completely repulsed from its walls, a panic&nbsp;having seized his army. The Novgorodians put to death&nbsp;many of their prisoners, and sold others as slaves, so that,&nbsp;to quote the words of their chronicler, “six Suzdalians&nbsp;could be bought for a grivna,” an old piece of money. In&nbsp;1173 Andrew was also defeated by Mstislaff the Brave at&nbsp;Smolensk, and in 1174 he was assassinated by his own&nbsp;nobles. The reign of Andrew was in all respects an important one. From his refusing to divide his dominions&nbsp;among his brothers and nephews, it is plain that he saw the&nbsp;evil effect of the system of apanages and could conceive the&nbsp;idea of a united state. He was a man of iron will, and an&nbsp;astute diplomatist rather than a great soldier. He thus&nbsp;had something of the spirit of the Ivans, and anticipated&nbsp;their policy. He may be said with truth to have been&nbsp;the last of the conspicuous rulers of Russia before the&nbsp;Mongol invasions. As yet we have had but few worthy&nbsp;of the attention of the historian. They are Rurik, the&nbsp;founder of the empire, Oleg the warrior, and Olga the&nbsp;first Christian sovereign. To these succeed the warlike</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
