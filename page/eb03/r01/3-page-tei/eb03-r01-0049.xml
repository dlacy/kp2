The other ſuppoſition therefore muſt. be accounted right ; and then, as to the <hi rend="italic">whole </hi>matter of the book, the reader is found to be exactly in the ſituation of a <hi rend="italic">repeater,</hi>  ſave that he takes what he ■ delivers from the page before him inſtead of his memory. It follows then, in proof of our initial propoſition, that, if we are directed by nature and propriety, the manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior in warmth and energy to what we fhould uſe, were the language before us the fpontaneous effuſions of our own hearts in the circumftances of thoſe out of whoſe mouths it is ſuppoſed to proceed.</p><p>Evident as the purport of this reaſoning is, it has not ſo much as been glanced at by the writers on the ſubject we are now entered upon, or any of its kindred ones ; which has occaſioned a manifeſt want oſ accuracy in ſeveral of their rules and obſervations. Among the reſt, this precept has been long reverberated from author to author as a perfect ſtandard for propriety in reading. " Deliver yourfelves in the ſame manner you would do, were the matter your own original ſentiments uttered directly ſrom the heart.” As all kinds of delivery muſt have many things in common, the rule will in many articles be undoubtedly right ; but, from what has been ſaid above, it muſt be as certainly faulty in reſpect to ſeveral others ; as it is certain nature never confounds by like ſigns two things ſo very different, as a <hi rend="italic">copy</hi>  and an <hi rend="italic">original,</hi>  an emanation darted immediately from the ſun, and its weaker appearance in the lunar reflection.</p><p>The precepts we have to offer for improving the above-mentioned rule, ihall be delivered under the heads of <hi rend="italic">accent, eτnphafis, modulation, exprefiιon, pauſes,</hi>  &amp;c.</p><p>'1. <hi rend="italic">Accent.</hi>  In attending to the affections of the Voice when we ſpeak, it is eaſy to obſerve, that, independent of any other conſideration, one part of it differs from another, in <hi rend="italic">βrefs, energy,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">force</hi>  of utterance. In words we ſind one ſyllable differing from another with reſpect to this mode ; and in ſentences one or more words as frequently vary from the reſt in a ſimilar manner. This ſtreſs with regard to <hi rend="italic">ſyllables</hi>  is called <hi rend="italic">accent,</hi>  and contributes greatly to the variety and harmony of language. Reſpecting <hi rend="italic">words,</hi>  it is termed <hi rend="italic">emphaſis ;</hi>  and its chief office is to aſſiſt the ſenſe, force, or perſpicuity of the ſentence—of which more under tbe iιext head.</p><p>" Accent (as defcr⅛ed in the Lectures on Elocu-tion) is made by us two ways; either by dwelling longer upon one ſyllable than tbe reſt, or by giving it a Γmarter percuſſion of the voice in utterance. Df the firſt of thefe we have inſtances in the words <hi rend="italic">glory, father, holy ;</hi>  of the laſt in <hi rend="italic">bat’tie, hadit, bor'row.</hi>  So that accent with ‘us is not referred to tune, but to time ; to quantity, not quality ; to the more equable or precipitate motion of the voice, not to the variation of the notes or inflexions.”</p><p>In <hi rend="italic">theatric declamation,</hi>  in order to give it more pomp and ſolemnity, it is ufual to dwell longer than common upon the unaccented ſyllables ; and the author now quoted has endeavoured to prove (p. 51. 54.) the practice faulty, and to ſſiow (p. 55.) that " though it (i. e. true folemnity) may demand a flower utterance</p><lb/><p>than uſual, yet (it) requires that the ſame proportion in point of quantity be obſerved in the ſyllables, as there is in mufical notes when the ſame tune is played in quicker or flower time.” But that this deviation from ordinary ſpeech is not a fault, as our author afferts ; nay, that on the contrary it is a real beauty when kept under proper regulation, the following obſervations it 13 hoped will ſuſſiciently prove.</p><p>(I.) It is a truth of the moſt obvious nature, that thoſe things which on their application to their proper ſenſes have a power of raffing in us certain ideas and emotions, are ever <hi rend="italic">differently</hi>  modified in their conſtituent parts when different effects are produced in the mind : and alſo (II.) that, within proper bounds, were we to ſuppoſe theſe conftituent parts to be proportionally in-creaſed or diminiſſied as to <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi>  this effect would ſtill be the ſame as to <hi rend="italic">quality.—</hi>For inſtance : The different ideas of ſtrength, ſwiftneſs, &amp;c. which are raiſed in us by the ſame ſpecies of animals, is owing to the different form of their correſponding parts; the different effects of muſic on the paſſions, t® the different airs and movements of the melody ; and the different expreſſions of human ſpeech, to a difference in tone, fpeed, &amp;c. of the voice. And theſe peculiar effects would ſtill remain the ſame, were we to ſuppofe the animals above alluded to, to be <hi rend="italic">greater</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">lefjer,</hi>  within their proper bounds ; the movement of the muſic <hi rend="italic">quicker</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">flower, </hi>provided it did not palpably interfere with that of fome other ſpecies ; and the pitch of the voice <hi rend="italic">higher</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">lower, </hi>if not carried out of the limits in which it is obſerved on fimilar occafions naturally to move. Farther (III.) fince, reſpecting the emotions more efpecially, there are no rules to determine <hi rend="italic">à priori</hi>  what effect any particular attribute or modification of an object will have upon a percipient, our knowledge of this kind mnſt evidently be gained from experience. Laſtly, (IV.) In every art imitating nature we are pleaſed to fee the characteriſtic members of the pattern <hi rend="italic">heightened</hi>  a little farther than perhaps it ever was carried in any real example, provided it be not bordering upon ſome ludicrous and diſagreeable provinces of exceſs.</p><p>Now for the application of theſe premiffes.—To keep pace and be conſiſtent with the z⅛∙∏ι(y of the tragic muſe, the delivery of her language ſſiould neceffarily be dignified ; and this it is plain from obſervation (I.) cannot be accompliſhed otherwiſe than by ſomething diffe-rent in the manner oſ it from that of ordinary fpeech ; fince <hi rend="italic">dignity</hi>  is effentially different from <hi rend="italic">familiarity.</hi>  But how muſt we diſcover this different manner ? By attending to nature : and in this caſe ſſie tells us, that befides ufing a<hi rend="italic">βower</hi>  delivery, and greater <hi rend="italic">diβinfinejs</hi>  of the words (which every thing merely <hi rend="italic">grave</hi>  requires, and gravity is a <hi rend="italic">concomitant</hi>  of dignity, though not its <hi rend="italic">effence), </hi>we muft dwell a little <hi rend="italic">longer</hi>  upon the <hi rend="italic">unaccented</hi>  ſyllables than we do in common. As to what our author obſerves io the above quotation, of <hi rend="italic">dignity’s</hi>  only requiring a <hi rend="italic">βower</hi>  utterance than ordinary, while the proportion of the ſyllables as to quantity continues the fame; it is apprehended the remark (II.) reſpecting <hi rend="italic">quicknefs</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Jlownefs</hi>  of movement, will ſhow it to be not altogether true. For ſince the delivery is not altered in <hi rend="italic">form,</hi>  its expreſſion muft be ftill of the fame kind, and perhaps what may be rightly ſuggeſted by the term <hi rend="italic">gravely familiar.</hi></p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
