<p><span class="font1">conclusive as to date, and the style of the male portrait (which recalls the realistic bronze busts found at Pompeii) points rather&nbsp;to an early Flavian date. Amongst the finest pieces of this&nbsp;collection is a large bowl with an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emblema</span><span class="font1"> in high relief (Plate&nbsp;VII. fig. 35), which was at first taken to represent the city of&nbsp;Alexandria, on account of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sislrum</span><span class="font1"> which appears amongst&nbsp;the attributes of the figure. It seems, however, to be a personification of the province of Africa, which was conventionally&nbsp;represented with a headdress formed by an elephant’s scalp&nbsp;with trunk and tusks. We have in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emblema</span><span class="font1"> the earliest&nbsp;example of the ideal types which the Roman artists of the&nbsp;Empire called into being to symbolize the subject-countries;&nbsp;the inexhaustible fertility of the African soil is indicated by&nbsp;the cornucopiae and the fruits carried in the bosom of the&nbsp;figure. But there is some trace of that overcharging of symbolism to which we drew attention in discussing the Prima&nbsp;Porta statue of Augustus; and, though the bowl was in a very&nbsp;fine state of preservation, there is little doubt that this was due&nbsp;to the care with which if had been kept—it was of course an&nbsp;ornament reserved for the table or sideboard—and that we&nbsp;should date it to the Augustan period. The same is clearly&nbsp;true of the most important pieces comprised in the treasure—&nbsp;the pair of cups reserved by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and&nbsp;forming part of his collection (Plate VII. figs. 33 and 34).&nbsp;In these we have examples of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cruslae,</span><span class="font1"> or plaques decorated&nbsp;in repoussé, which were mounted on smooth silver cups. The&nbsp;manufacture of these—or at least the designing thereof—was&nbsp;a special branch of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caelalura,</span><span class="font1"> and Pliny mentions an artist&nbsp;named Teucer who achieved distinction therein; we may&nbsp;possibly identify him with the gem-engraver whose signature&nbsp;is read on an amethyst at Florence. Upon one of these (Plate&nbsp;VII. fig. 34), we see a seated figure of Augustus, approached&nbsp;by a processional group On both sides. To the left are three&nbsp;divinities, the foremost of whom presents a statuette of Victory&nbsp;to the emperor; to the right is Mars in full panoply, in whose&nbsp;train follow the conquered provinces, symbolized by female&nbsp;figures, amongst whom we recognize Africa with her elephant&nbsp;headgear (see above). On the other face of the cup we see&nbsp;Augustus again seated, receiving the homage of a group of&nbsp;barbarians ushered into his presence by a Roman commander.&nbsp;The schemes which are here found for the first time, became&nbsp;typical in Roman historical art, and thence passed into the&nbsp;service of Christianity to portray the homage of the Magi. The&nbsp;second cup celebrates the glories of Tiberius, whose triumphal&nbsp;procession appears on the one face, and a finely conceived&nbsp;scene of sacrifice on the other. For the occasion various dates&nbsp;have been suggested (13-12 or 8-7 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.);</span><span class="font1"> but it seems most&nbsp;likely that the return of Tiberius from Dalmatia in </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 9 is&nbsp;here commemorated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fortunate preservation of the Bosco Reale treasure has enabled us to appraise Roman silverwork at its true value.&nbsp;It also affords some confirmation of the rapid decadence of the&nbsp;art, which Pliny laments. Amongst the cups are two decorated&nbsp;with still-life subjects and signed by an artist who writes a&nbsp;Roman name (Sabinus) in Greek characters, which clearly&nbsp;belong to the last years of Pompeii, and are coarser in execution&nbsp;than the earlier pieces. And the simple </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emblemata</span><span class="font1"> of. the&nbsp;classical period, which stand out against the background of&nbsp;the bowl in which they are framed, give place to such a&nbsp;crowded group as we find on a gold patera@@<sup>1</sup> found at&nbsp;Rennes and preserved in the Cabinet des Médailles, where&nbsp;the artist has surrounded the central </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emblema</span><span class="font1"> with a&nbsp;frieze which detracts from its effect. This and still later&nbsp;specimens of Roman silversmiths’ work are described in the&nbsp;article </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gem-Engraving and Minor Arts.—</span><span class="font1">The art of the gem-engraver, like that of the silversmith, was naturally held in high esteem by the wealthy Romans both of the Republic and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Empire;@@<sup>2</sup> and the period of its highest excellence coincides almost precisely with that which gave birth to the masterpieces&nbsp;of Roman silver-chasing. By far the greater part of the&nbsp;ancient gems which exist in modern collections belong to the&nbsp;Roman period; and the great popularity of gem-engraving&nbsp;amongst the Romans is shown by the enormous number of&nbsp;imitative works cast in coloured glass paste, which reproduce&nbsp;the subjects represented in more precious materials. Not only&nbsp;were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">intagli</span><span class="font1"> thus produced to suit the popular demand, but&nbsp;fine cameos were at times cut (not cast) in coloured glass; the&nbsp;most notable example of these is a portrait of Tiberius in&nbsp;turquoise-coloured glass bearing the signature of Herophilus&nbsp;(see below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the style of Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">intagli</span><span class="font1"> we can trace each of the phases through which Roman plastic art has been shown to&nbsp;pass.@@<sup>3</sup> A black agate in the Hague Museum (Furtwängler,&nbsp;pl. xlvii. 13) supplies a characteristic portrait of the Ciceronian age; the splendid cornelian of the Tyszkiewicz collection&nbsp;(Furtwängler, pl. 1. 19) with the signature Π0ΠΙΛ · AABAN ·&nbsp;which portrays Augustus in the guise of Posciclon in a chariot&nbsp;drawn by four hippocamps, is doubtless (as Furtwängler showed)&nbsp;to be referred to the victory of Actium; the classicism of the&nbsp;early Empire is exemplified by a sardonyx in Florence (Furtwängler, pl. lix. 11), which probably displays an empress&nbsp;of the Julio-Claudian line with the attributes of Hera; a&nbsp;sardonyx in the hermitage at St Petersburg (Furtwängler,&nbsp;pl. Iviii. 1) is noteworthy because the subject is borrowed&nbsp;from painting and occurs on a Pompeian fresco discovered in&nbsp;1897; the portraiture of the Flavian epoch is seen at its best&nbsp;in the aquamarine of the Cabinet des Médailles signed by&nbsp;Euhodos, which represents Julia, the daughter of Titus (Furtwängler, pl. xlviii. 8). Amongst later gems one of the finest&nbsp;is the “Hunt of Commodus ” in the Cabinet des Médailles (Furtwängler, pl. 1. 41), which is engraved in one of the stones&nbsp;most popular with the Roman artists—the “ Nicolo,” a sardonyx&nbsp;with a bluish-grey upper layer used as background and a dark&nbsp;brown under layer in which the design is cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the masterpieces of Roman gem-cutting are to be found in the great cameos, the finest of which no doubt belonged to&nbsp;the treasures of the imperial house. These were engraved in&nbsp;various materials, including single coloured stones such as&nbsp;amethyst or chalcedony; but the stone most fitted by nature&nbsp;for this branch of art was the sardonyx in its two chief varieties&nbsp;—the Indian, distinguished by the warmth and lustre of its&nbsp;tones, and the Arabian, with a more subdued scale of colour.&nbsp;As examples of these we shall take the two master-works of&nbsp;the art—the “ Grand camée de France ” (Plate VII. fig. 37),&nbsp;and the “ Gemma Augustea ” (Plate VII. fig. 36), preserved&nbsp;in the imperial collection at Vienna. The latter is attributed&nbsp;by Furtwängler to Dioscorides, the artist who, as Pliny tells us,&nbsp;enjoyed the exclusive privilege of portraying the features of&nbsp;Augustus. We possess several gems inscribed with his name,&nbsp;as well as with those of his sons and pupils—Eutyches, Hero-philus (see above) and Hyllos; and, though several of these&nbsp;are Renaissance forgeries, enough genuine material exists&nbsp;for an appreciation of his style. The Arabian sardonyx was&nbsp;amongst his favourite stones, and the Vienna cameo at least&nbsp;represents the work of his school. Blending the real with the&nbsp;ideal, the artist has represented in the upper zone Augustus&nbsp;and Rome enthroned. Behind them is a group of divine&nbsp;figures—the inhabited Earth, Time and Tellus, according to&nbsp;the most probable interpretation; to the left we see Tiberius&nbsp;descending from a chariot driven by Victory, before which&nbsp;stands a youth, probably Germanicus. We seem to have&nbsp;here, as in the Bosco Reale cup, a scene from the triumphal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
