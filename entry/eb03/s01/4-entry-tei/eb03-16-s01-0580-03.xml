in Greek antiquity, were nocturnal myſteries in honour of Jupiter Sabazius. All the initiated had a golden ſerpent put in at their breaſts, and taken out at the lower part of their garments, in memory of Jupiter’s raviſhing Proſerpina in the form of a ſerpent. There were also other feaſts and ſacriſices diſtinguiſhed by this appellation, in honour of Mithras, the deity of the Perlians, and of Bacchus, who was thus denominated by the Sabians, a people of Thrace.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
