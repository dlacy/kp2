<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to Falborne Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, lie removed to Black Notley, where he afterwards remained. His life&nbsp;there was quiet and uneventful, but embittered by bodily&nbsp;weakness and chronic sores. He occupied himself in writing books and in keeping up a very wide scientific correspondence, and lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age&nbsp;of seventy-six, dying on 17th January 1705.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ray’s first book, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catalogas plantarum circa Cantabrigiarn nascentium</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1660, followed by appendices in 1663 and 1685), was&nbsp;written in conjunction with his “ ainicissimus et individuus comes,”&nbsp;John Nid. The plants, 626 in number, are enumerated alphabetic-ally, but a system of classification differing little from Caspar&nbsp;Bauhin’s is sketched at the end of the book ; and the notes contain&nbsp;many curious references to other parts of natural history. The&nbsp;stations of the plants are minutely described; and Cambridge&nbsp;students still gather some of their rarer plants in the copses or&nbsp;chalk-pits where he found them. The book shows signs of his&nbsp;indebtedness to Joachim Jung of Hamburg, who had died in 1657&nbsp;leaving his writings unpublished ; but a MS. copy of some of them&nbsp;was sent to Ray by Hartlieb in 1660. Jung invented or gave&nbsp;precision to many technical terms that Ray and others at once&nbsp;made use of in their descriptions, and that are now classical; and&nbsp;his notions of what constitutes a specific distinction and ■what&nbsp;characters are valueless as such seem to have been adopted with&nbsp;little change by Ray. The first two editions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catalogus&nbsp;plantarum A nglise</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1670, 1677) were likewise arranged alphabetic-ally ; but in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Synopsis stirpium Britannicarum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1690, 1696,&nbsp;also re-edited by Dillenius 1724, and by Hill 1760) Ray applied&nbsp;the scheme of classification which he had by that time elaborated&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mcthodus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historia plantarum.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mcthodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1682) was largely based on the works of Csesalpini&nbsp;and Jung, and still more on that of Morison of Oxford. The&nbsp;greatest merit of this book is the use of the number of cotyledons&nbsp;as a basis of classification ; though it must be remembered that&nbsp;the difference between the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous&nbsp;embryo was detected by Grew. After dividing plants into flowerless&nbsp;and flowering, Ray says, “ Floríferas dividemus in Dicotyledones,&nbsp;quarum semina sata binis foliis anomalis, seminalibus dictis, quae&nbsp;cotyledonorum usum pnestant, e terra exeunt, vel in binos saltern&nbsp;lobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terram foliorum specie non&nbsp;efferent; et Monocotyledones, quae nec folia bina seminalia efferent&nbsp;nee lobos binos condunt. Hsec divisio ad arbores etiam extendi&nbsp;potest; siquidem Palmre et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo&nbsp;a reliquis arboribus different quo Monocotyledones a reliquis&nbsp;herbis. ” But a serious blemish was his persistent separation of&nbsp;trees from herbs, a distinction whose falsity had been exposed by&nbsp;Jung and others, but to which Ray tried to give scientific foundation by denying the existence of buds in the latter. At this time&nbsp;he based his classification, like Caesalpini, chiefly upon the fruit,&nbsp;and he distinguished several natural groups, such as the grasses,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labiatse, Umbelliferse,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Papilionacese.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The classification of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mcthodus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was extended and improved in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historia plantarum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">but was disfigured by a large class of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Anómala,,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to include forms&nbsp;that the other orders did not easily admit, and by the separation&nbsp;of the cereals from other grasses. The first volume of this vast&nbsp;book was published in 1685, the second in the next year, and the&nbsp;third in 1704 ; it enumerates and describes all the plants known&nbsp;to the author or described by his predecessors, to the number,&nbsp;according to Adanson, of 18,625 species. In the first volume a&nbsp;chapter “ De plantis in genere” contains an account of all the&nbsp;anatomical and physiological knowledge of the time regarding&nbsp;plants, with the recent speculations and discoveries of Csesalpini,&nbsp;Grew, Malpighi, and Jung. And Cuvier and Dupetit Thouars,&nbsp;declaring that it was this chapter which gave acceptance and&nbsp;authority to these authors’ works, say that “the best monument&nbsp;that could be erected to the memory of Ray would be the republication of this part of his work separately.” The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stirpium Europee-arum extra Britannias nascentium Sylloge</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1694) is a much amplified&nbsp;edition of the catalogue of plants collected on his own Continental&nbsp;tour. In the preface to this book he first clearly admitted the&nbsp;doctrine of the sexuality of plants, which, however, he had no&nbsp;share in establishing. Here also begins his long controversy with&nbsp;Rivinus, which chiefly turned upon Ray’s indefensible separation&nbsp;of ligneous from herbaceous plants, and also upon what he conceived to be the misleading reliance that Rivinus placed on the&nbsp;characters of the corolla. But in the second edition of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Methodus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1703) he followed Rivinus and Tournefort in taking the flower&nbsp;instead of the fruit as his basis of classification : he was no longer&nbsp;a fructicist but a corollist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides editing his friend Willughby’s books, Ray wrote several zoological works of his own, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Synopses of Quadrupeds&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1693), that is to say, both mammals and reptiles, of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Birds,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fishes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1713) ; the last two were published posthumously, as was&nbsp;also the more important </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historia Insectorum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1710). The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of Insects</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> embodied a great mass of Willughby’s notes, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Synopses of Birds and Fishes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> were mere abridgments of the “ Ornithology” and “Ichthyology.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Most of Ray’s minor works were the outcome of his faculty for laborious compiling and cataloguing ; for instance, his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collection&nbsp;of English Proverbs</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1670), his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collection of out-of-the-way English&nbsp;Words</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1674), his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collection of Curious Travels and Voyages&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1693), and his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dictionariolnm trilingue, or Nomenclátor classicus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1675). The last was written for the use of Willughby’s sons, his&nbsp;pupils ; it passed through many editions, and is still useful for&nbsp;its careful identifications of plants and animals mentioned by&nbsp;Greek and Latin writers. But Ray’s permanent influence and&nbsp;reputation have probably depended most of all upon his two books&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1691), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution&nbsp;and Changes of the World</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1692). The latter includes three&nbsp;essays, on “The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World,”&nbsp;“The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects,” and “The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations.” The germ of these&nbsp;works was contained in sermons preached long before in Cambridge.&nbsp;Both books obtained immediate popularity ; the former, at least,&nbsp;was translated into several languages ; and to this day their influence is apparent. For, as Sir J. Smith says in his biography of&nbsp;Ray, “this book </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[The Wisdom of God,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &amp;c.] is the basis of all the&nbsp;labours of following divines, who have made the book of nature a&nbsp;commentary on the Book of Revelation.” In it Ray recites innumerable examples of the perfection of organic mechanism, the&nbsp;multitude and variety of living creatures, the minuteness and&nbsp;usefulness of their parts. Many, if not most, of the familiar&nbsp;proofs of purposive adaptation and design in nature were suggested&nbsp;by Ray. The structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones,&nbsp;the camel’s stomach, the hedgehog’s armour, are among the thousand instances cited by him of immediate creative interpositions.&nbsp;But, though his application of natural history to apologetic theology has made his reputation peculiarly wide, it must be acknowledged that none of his scientific discoveries at all equal in value&nbsp;those of the physiological botanists who immediately preceded him,&nbsp;and that even in classificatory insight he was surpassed by several&nbsp;of his contemporaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAYMOND LULLY. See Lully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAYMOND </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">of Sabunde </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Sebonde, Sebeyde, Ac.) appears to have been born at Barcelona towards the end&nbsp;of the 14th century. He combined the training of a physician and a theologian, and was professor of theology at&nbsp;Toulouse, seemingly from the year 1430 oivwards. He&nbsp;published there in 1436 his chief work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theologia Naturalis,&nbsp;sive liber creaturarum.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> This book was reprinted pretty&nbsp;frequently during the next two centuries, and has recently&nbsp;been republished at Sulzbacli (1852), but without the introduction, which, for some not very intelligible reason, was&nbsp;placed upon the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Itidex</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> by the council of Trent. It was&nbsp;translated into French by. Montaigne at the command of&nbsp;his father (see Montaigne, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Essais</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, ii. 12). The six </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogi&nbsp;de natura hominis</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> are an extract from the larger work made&nbsp;by Raymond himself. Raymond is a scholastic of the&nbsp;period of decline. The chief thought of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theologia&nbsp;Naturalis</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the parallelism between the book of nature&nbsp;and the book of revelation. The second of these two books&nbsp;is more sacred on account of its supernatural character,&nbsp;but a foundation must be laid by the study of the first.&nbsp;Nature culminates in man, who alone of the creatures&nbsp;possesses all the four properties which mark off the different&nbsp;grades of existence </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(esse, vivere, sentire, intelligere).</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> But&nbsp;man himself points forward to a self-existent unity in which&nbsp;individual differences disappear. Everything that we find&nbsp;in the creatures is present in God without limitation or&nbsp;negation, so that God’s being is the universal being of all&nbsp;things. Hence it is true that God created the world out&nbsp;of nothing. Raymond endeavours to deduce the principal&nbsp;dogmas of the church by the natural light in a similar&nbsp;fashion. Man’s own advantage and the glory of God are</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
