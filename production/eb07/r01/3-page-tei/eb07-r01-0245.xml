These are perpetually changing their situations and forms ; and the high winds raise the sand in clouds, which render the road dangerous when they prevail. The sand is white and very fine, so that horses sink up to the knees at every step ; and it is so light as to prevent almost all vegetation.</p><p>Natal, the capital (so named because the church was consecrated on Christmas-day), sometimes called Cidade dos Reys<hi rend="sub">1</hi> or City of the Kings, is situated on the right margin of the Rio Grande, about two miles above its mouth. So highly was the position of Natal at one time valued, that during the Dutch war its fortress was deemed the strongest place in Brazil. At present it contains some good streets, squares, and churches, a governor’s palace, a town-hall, prison, and other public buildings. The harbour of Natal is spacious, and a flourishing trade is carried on. The population amounts to about 19,000.</p><p>To the north of Natal lies the town of Estremoz, about ten miles to the north-west, and at the same distance from the sea. In the western part of the province are several towns, of which the most considerable is that formerly called Assu, but now dignified with the name of Villa Nova da Princesa. It is situated on the left bank of the river of the same name, otherwise called the Parinhas, twenty-five miles from its mouth. Its position is nearly in the centre of Rio Grande ; and the road leading from Natal to it having been traversed by Mr Koster, a brief abstract of his description will serve to convey an idea of the character of the province in this quarter. The tract of country through which the road lies, is a plain traversed by a river remarkable for its serpentine evolutions. Here is a place called Lagoa Seca, or dry lake ; a place which is laid under water by the rains, but which supplies the capital with farinha during the drought. Between eight and ten leagues from Natal is Pai Paulo, a place situated on the borders of the Sertam, a long barren plain of five days’ journey. This scene is desolate and dreary in the extreme. On approaching Assu, however, lands covered with wood make their appearance ; and fazendas and other indications of human neighbourhood rise around. The town of Assu is situated upon the northern bank of the smaller branch of the river Assu, which here runs for a short distance in two channels. This place, chiefly built in the form of a square, contains several churches, and other public buildings. There are numerous salt-works in the vicinity, which bring some trade to the place, and large barks in the proper season ascend the river to the town. At the distance of about a league from Assu is the lake of Piato, three leagues in length by one in breadth, which is filled by the river in the rainy season, and is never quite dry. In summer its sides afford a rich soil for the cultivation of rice, maize, the cane, melons, and cotton. Between this place and the frontier of the province of Seara, a distance of four days’ journey, the country consists for the most part of plains, with trees thinly scattered, and patches of wood. Several salt-marshes intervene, and these, during the rainy season, form lakes. The Arraial of St Luzia stands on the left bank of the river Appody, about twenty miles from the sea. Large canoes advance up the river to this place, which carries on a trade in salt. From this situation downwards are found the famous salterns of Massoro, the salt of which is as white as snow. The Appody has a course of a hundred and thirty miles, running almost the whole way through a flat country, interspersed with lakes, which it fills by its floods. This river forms the boundary line between Rio Grande do Norte and Seara. The soil of many parts of this province is favourable to the growth of sugar-cane, and some trade is carried on in sugar, which, together with salt, seems to be the staple of commerce in this quarter of Brazil. The population of the whole province is not supposed to exceed 80,000 inhabitants.</p><p>Rio Grande do Sul, formerly the most southern province in the empire of Brazil, but, according to recent accounts, now an independent republic of South America. It declared its independence in 1836, and resolved on introducing a constitution similar to that of the United States of North America. In April and May 1838 two severe conflicts took place between the troops of the emperor of Brazil and the insurgents, in both of which the former were defeated with great slaughter. Whether this country may ultimately succeed in maintaining its position among the republican states of South America, appears very doubtful. Rio Grande do Sul is bounded on the north by St Catharina and St Paulo ; on the west by the river Uruguay, which separates it from the republic of the same name ; on the south by the river Plata; and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Itis upwards of five hundred miles in length by four hundred in breadth, lying between latitude 28° and 35° south, and enjoys a temperate and salubrious climate. This extensive country chiefly consists of large plains, covered with immense herds of cattle and other animals. Some mountain-ridges traverse it in various directions, but none of them is of any great height. Here several large rivers have their origin, of which the Uruguay, the Jacuhy or Rio Pardo, and the Camapuam, are the most important Its great extent Of level and alluvial coast exhibits some lakes of vast dimensions. The Lagoa dos Patos is the largest lake in Brazil, being one hundred and fifty miles in length from northeast to south-west and about forty miles in breadth. It is said to derive its name from a species of fowl which frequents its waters in great numbers. This lake is the recipient of almost all the streams which irrigate the northern and eastern portions of the country. It is very shallow, and its water continues fresh as far as the island dos Marin-heiros, near the port of St Pedro. Although encumbercd with sand-banks, and subject to violent squalls of wind, it may be navigated without much risk. The peninsula lying between the lake and the ocean is low and level, and almost in a direct line on the eastern side, but forms various points and bays on the opposite side. The western shore of the lake is bold but not rugged, and is cut by several rivers, of which the Camapuam and Jacuhy, already mentioned, are most deserving of notice. The sources of the former are in a chain of low hills called the great Cochilha, which traverses the western limits of the country. It flows with a rapid and disturbed current interrupted by continued cataracts for nearly a hundred miles, receiving fourteen streams from the south and fifteen from the north, and falls into the lake about the middle of its western side, by five different channels, formed by four small islands. The Jacuhy, sometimes called the Rio Pardo, which is one of its tributaries, is a river of still greater value. It rises in the province of St Paulo, and after traversing the southern declivity of the general ridge for a few leagues, it turns eastward, describing innumerable windings for a course of thirty leagues, during which it collects the water of a number of smaller rivers, many of them being navigable. It then suddenly bends towards the south, and after running fifteen miles in this direction, enters the western side of the lake about four leagues below its northern extremity. It is a fine, broad and deep river, with lofty and diversified banks, and is full of little islands. To the south-west of the Lagoa dos Patos lies another sheet of water, called Lake Mirim, or Mirin. It is ninety miles in length by about twenty in breadth, and discharges itself into the Lagoa dos Patos by means of a channel called the river of St Gonzales. Lake Mirim is very shallow, and in the rainy season it widely extends its borders. The Gonzales is fifty miles in length : it is wide and handsome, and navigable for small vessels, which by this channel pass into Lake Mirim, and thence by means of rivers penetrate into the fertile interior, and distribute their cargos to the large towns</p></body></text></TEI>
