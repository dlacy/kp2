<p><span class="font3">thorax these same muscles pull down the ribs and sternum. Thc M. triangularis sterni, which arises from the back or thoracic&nbsp;aspect of the sternum and lower costal cartilages and is inserted&nbsp;into the costal cartilages higher up, can obviously depress thc&nbsp;ribs. So also can the M. serratus posticus inferior, which arises&nbsp;from the thick fascia of the loins and is inserted into the last&nbsp;four ribs. So also can the M. quadrat us lumborum, which&nbsp;springs from the pelvis and is attached to the last rib. Indeed&nbsp;there is hardly a muscle of the body but may bc called into play&nbsp;during extremely laboured respiration, either because it acts on&nbsp;the chest, or because it serves to steady some part and give a&nbsp;better purchase for the action of direct respiratory muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Certain Abnormal Forms of Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coughing.—</span><span class="font3">There is first a deep inspiration followed by closure of the glottis. Then follows a violent expiratory effort&nbsp;which bursts open the glottis and drives the air out of thc lungs&nbsp;in a blast which carries away any light irritating matter it may&nbsp;meet with. The act is commonly involuntary, but may be&nbsp;imitated exactly by a voluntary effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hawking, OrClearing the Throat.—</span><span class="font3">In this act a current of air is driven from the lungs and forced through the narrow space&nbsp;between the root of the tongue and the depressed soft palate.&nbsp;This action can only be caused voluntarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sneezing.—</span><span class="font3">There is first an inspiration which is often unusually rapid; then follows a sudden expiration, and the blast is directed through the nose. The glottis remains open all the&nbsp;time. The act is generally involuntary, but may be more or&nbsp;less successfully imitated by a voluntary effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Snoring</span><span class="font3"> is caused by unusually steady and prolonged inspirations and expirations through the open mouth,—the soft palate and uvula being set vibrating by the currents of air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crying</span><span class="font3"> consists of short deep inspirations and prolonged expirations with the glottis partially closed. Long-continued&nbsp;crying leads to sobbing, in which sudden spasmodic contractions&nbsp;of the diaphragm cause sudden inspirations and inspiratory&nbsp;sounds generated in larynx and pharynx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sighing</span><span class="font3"> is a sudden and prolonged inspiration following an unusually long pause after the last expiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Laughing</span><span class="font3"> is caused by a scries of short expiratory blasts which provoke a clear sound from the vocal chords kept tense&nbsp;for the purpose, and at the same time other inarticulate but&nbsp;very characteristic sounds from the vibrating structures of the&nbsp;larynx and pharynx. The face has a characteristic expression.&nbsp;This act is'essentially involuntary, and often is beyond control;&nbsp;it can only be imitated very imperfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yawning</span><span class="font3"> is a long deep inspiration followed by a shorter expiration, the mouth, fauces and glottis being kept open in a&nbsp;characteristic fashion. It is involuntary, but may be imitated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hiccough</span><span class="font3"> is really an inspiration suddenly checked by closure of the glottis; the inspiration is due to a spasmodic contraction&nbsp;of the diaphragm. The closure of the glottis generally leads&nbsp;to a characteristic sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. G.*).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) Pathology of the Respiratory System</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the following article we have to give an account of the more important pathological processes which affect the lungs,&nbsp;pleurae and bronchial tubes. In the aetiology of pulmonary&nbsp;affections, the relations between the lungs and the external air,&nbsp;and also between them and the circulatory system, are important. The lungs are, so to speak, placed between the right&nbsp;and left cavities of the heart, and the only way for the blood&nbsp;to pass from the right ventricle to the left side of the heart,&nbsp;except in cases of a patent foramen ovale or other congenital&nbsp;defect forming a communication between the two sides of the&nbsp;organ, is by passing through them. The result is that not only&nbsp;may they become diseased by foreign material carried into them&nbsp;by the blood, but any obstruction to the flow of blood through&nbsp;the left side of the heart tends sooner or later to engorge or congest them, and lead to further changes. Through the nose and&nbsp;mouth they are in direct connexion with the external atmosphere. Hence the variable condition of the air as regards&nbsp;temperature, degree of moisture, and density, is liable to produce&nbsp;directly various changes in thc lungs, or to predispose them to&nbsp;disease; and the contamination of thc air with various pathogenic germs and irritating particles in thc shape </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">dust, is a&nbsp;direct source of many lung affections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bronchitis,</span><span class="font3"> or inflammation of thc mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes, has been generally attributed to exposure&nbsp;to atmospheric changes. It occurs with great frequence in the&nbsp;extremes of life, and it is in early childhood and in old age that&nbsp;it is more liable to be fatal. Bronchitis may often follow&nbsp;exposure to cold, but that low temperature in itself is not&nbsp;sufficient to cause it is shown by the fact that the crews of&nbsp;arctic expeditions have been singularly free from diseases usually&nbsp;attributed to cold, but on their return to moist germ-laden&nbsp;atmospheres have at once been affected. Children reared in&nbsp;heated rooms with lack of ventilation are peculiarly susceptible&nbsp;to attacks on the slightest change of temperature. Bronchitis&nbsp;is also frequently caused by cardiac and renal diseases, and by&nbsp;the extension of inflammatory diseases of the upper air passages&nbsp;(as rhinitis, laryngitis or pharyngitis), while blockage of the&nbsp;nasal passages by adenoid or other growths may, by causing&nbsp;persistent mouth-breathing, lead to bronchial infection. Before&nbsp;the bacterial origin of disease was understood, bronchitis was&nbsp;attributed solely to what is termed “ catching cold, ” and thc&nbsp;exact relation of thc chill to the bacterial infection is still&nbsp;unknown. It is probable that thc chilling of the surface of the&nbsp;body by exposure causes congestion of the muçous membrane,&nbsp;the presence of a virulent micro-organism being then all that is&nbsp;required to produce bronchitis. It is generally accepted that in&nbsp;persons living in the pure air of the country the small bronchi&nbsp;and air-cells are sterile (Barthel in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Zcntralblatt fur Bakteriologie,</span><span class="font3"> vol. xxiv.). Bacteria are arrested on their way by the&nbsp;leucocytes of the nasal mucous membrane and by the vibration&nbsp;of the ciliated epithelium of the upper air passages. The mucous&nbsp;membrane of the upper bronchi is, however, tenanted by various&nbsp;micro-organisms such as the diplo-bacillus of Friedländer,&nbsp;bacillus coli communis, micrococcus tetragenus, &amp;c., and it is&nbsp;considered by William Ewart that these organisms may in&nbsp;certain conditions of their host become virulent. “ Specific ”&nbsp;bronchitis occurs in the course of a specific infective disease&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font3"> influenza, measles or whooping cough) and is due to the&nbsp;specific micro-organism gaining access by the mucous membrane&nbsp;of the respiratory tract. Cases have been known in which the&nbsp;diphtheria bacillus has been so localized. In glanders, small-pox,&nbsp;syphilis and pemphigus, the infective micro-organism is carried&nbsp;to the bronchi by the blood stream. In common or “ nonspecific” bronchitis, streptococci, pneumococci and staphylococci&nbsp;are found in the sputum together with Friedländer’s bacillus&nbsp;and the bacillus coli communis. Microscopically the bronchi&nbsp;show hyperaemia of the mucous and submucous coats, and the&nbsp;whole wall becomes infiltrated with polymorphonuclear&nbsp;leucocytes and round cells. Many cells undergo mucoid degeneration, and there is abundant epithelial proliferation. A&nbsp;large quantity of mucus is secreted by the glands, and the&nbsp;lumen of the bronchi contains an exudate consisting of mucus,&nbsp;degenerated leucocytes and cast-off epithelial cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the rare form of bronchitis known as fibrinous or plastic bronchitis a membranous exudate is formed which forms casts&nbsp;of the bronchi, which may be coughed up. The casts vary from&nbsp;an inch to six or seven inches in length, with branches corresponding to the divisions of the bronchi from which they come.&nbsp;The cast consists of mucus and fibrin in varying proportions.&nbsp;The exact pathology of this variety is still undetermined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bronchitis may affect the whole bronchial tract, or more especially the larger or the smaller tubes. It may occur as an&nbsp;acute or as a chronic affection. In the acute form the inflammation may remain limited to thc bronchial tubes and gradually&nbsp;subside, or it may lead to inflammation of thc surrounding lung&nbsp;tissue, giving rise to disseminated foci of inflammation of greater&nbsp;or less extent throughout the lungs (catarrhal or bronchopneumonia). This is a common complication </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">bronchitis,&nbsp;especially where the smaller tubes are affected, and is more</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
