            <p>If the Sâmaveda has thus its ample share of Brâhmana-literature, though in part of a
                somewhat questionable character, it is not less richly supplied with
                siltra-treatises, some of which probably belong to the oldest works of that class.
                There are three Śrauta- sûtras, which attach themselves more or less closely to the
                Panchavimśa-brâhmana:—Masaka’s <hi rend="italic">Ârsheya-kalpa,</hi> which gives the
                beginnings of the sâmans in their sacrificial order, thus supplementing the
                Ârsheya-brahmana, which enumerates their technical names; and the Śrauta-sûtras of

                the Kauthuma and Raniiyaniya schools respectively, which differ but little from each
                other, and form complete manuals of the duties of the udgatars. Another sûtra, of an
                exegetic character, the <hi rend="italic">Anupada-sûtra,</hi> likewise follows the
                Panchavimsa, the difficult passages of which it explains. Besides these, there are a
                con- sideralde number of sûtras and kindred technical treatises bearing on the
                prosody and phonetics of the sama-texts. The more important of them are—the <hi

                the sage Vaiśampâvana. Of his disciples three are specially named, viz., Katha,
                Kalapin, and Yaska Paingi, the last of whom again is stated to have communicated the
                sacrificial science to Tittiri.</p>
            <p>How far this genealogy of teachers may be authentic cannot now be determined ; but
                certain it is that in accordance therewith we have three old collections of
                Yajus-texts, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Kâthaka,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"

                    @@</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">7 </hi>The Kathaka and Kâlapaka are
                frequently mentioned together ; and the author of the “ great commentary ” on Panini
                once remarks that these works were taught in every village. The Kathas and Kâlapas
                are often referred to under the collective name of Charakas, which apparently means
                “wayfarers” or itinerant scholars; but according to a later writer (Hemachandra)
                Charaka is no other than Vaiśimpâyana himself, after whom his followers would have
                been thus called. From the Kathas proper two schools seem early to have branched
                off, the Prâchya- (eastern) and Kapishthala- Kathas, the text-recension of the
                latter of whom lias recently been discovered in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kapishthala-katha-samhitâ.</hi> The Kalapas also soon became subdivided into
                numerous different schools. Thus from one of Kalapin’s immediate disciples, Haridru,
                the Haridraviyas took their origin, whose text-recension, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hâri- dravika,</hi> is quoted together with the Kathaka as early as in Yaska’s
                Nirukta ; but we do not know whether it differed much from the original Kalapa
                texts. As regards the Taittiriya-saiphita, that collection, too, in course of time
                gave rise to a number of different schools, the text handed down being that of the
                Apastambas; while the contents of another recension, that of the Atrcyas, are known
                from their Anukramani, which has been preserved.</p>
            <p>The four collections of old Yajus texts, so far known to us, while differing more or
                less considerably in arrangement and verbal points, have the main mass of their
                textual matter in common. This common matter consists of both sacrificial prayers
                (yajus) in verse and prose and exegetic or illustrative prose portions (brahmana). A
                prominent feature of the old Yajus texts, as compared with the other Vedas, is the
                constant intermixture of textual and exegetic portions. The Charakas and Taittiriyas
                thus do not recognize the distinction between Samhita and Brahmana in the sense of
                two separate collections of texts, but they have only a Samhitâ, or collection,
                which includes likewise the exegetic or Brahmana portions. The Taittiriyas seem at last to have been impressed with their
                want of a separate Brahmana and to have set about supplying the deficiency in rather
                an awkward fashion : instead of separating from each other the textual and exegetic
                portions of their Samhitä, they merely added to the latter a supplement (in three
                books), which shows the same mixed condition, and applied to it the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Taittirlya-brâhmanaa. @@8</hi> But, though the main body of this
                work is manifestly of a supplementary nature, a portion of it may perhaps be old,
                and may once have formed part of the Samhita, considering that the latter con-,
                sists of seven ashtakas, instead of eight, as this term requires, and that certain
                essential parts of the ceremonial handled in the Brahmana are entirely wanting in
                the Saiphitä. Attached to this work is the <hi rend="italic"

            <p>The defective arrangement of the Yajus texts was at last remedied by a different
                school of Adhvaryus, the Väjasaneyins. The reputed originator of this school and its
                text-recension is Yâjnavalkya Vâjasaneya (son of Väjasani). The result of the re-
                arrangement of the texts was a collection of sacrificial mantras, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vâjasaneyi-samhitâ,</hi> and a Brâhmana, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Śatapatha.</hi> On account of the greater lucidity of this arrangement, the
                Väjasaneyins called their texts the White (or clear) Yajurveda,—the name of Black
                (or obscure) Yajus being for opposite reasons applied to the Charaka texts. Both the
                Samhita and Brahmana of the Väjasaneyins have come down to us in two different
                recensions, viz., those of the <hi rend="italic">MAdhyandina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">KAnva</hi> schools ; and we find besides a considerable number of
                quotations from a Väjasaneyaka, from which we cannot doubt that there must have been
                at least one other recension of the Satapatha-brâhmana. The difference between the
                two extant recensions is, on the whole, but slight as regards the subject-matter;
                but in point of diction it is quite sufficient to make a comparison especially
                interesting from a philological point of view. Which of the two versions may be the
                more original cannot as yet be determined ; but the phonetic and grammatical
                differences will probably have to be accounted for by a geographical separation of
                the two schools rather than by a difference of age. In several points of difference
                the Känva recension agrees with the practice of the Rik-samhitä, and there probably
                was some connexion between the Yajus school of Känvas and the famous family of
                risliis of that name to which the eighth mandala of the Rik is attributed.</p>

                consists of forty adhyâyas, the first eighteen of which contain the formulas of the
                ordinary sacrifices. The last fifteen adhyäyas are doubtless a later addition,—as
                may also be the case as regards the preceding seven chapters. The last adhyâya is
                commonly known under the title of Vajasaneyi-sarphita- (or Isâvâsya-) upanishad.

                fruitlessness of mere works, and to insist on the necessity of man’s acquiring a

                about equal parts, of verses (rich) and prose formulas (yajus). The majority of the
                former occur likewise in the Rik-samhitâ, from which they were doubtless extracted.
                Not unfrequently, however, they show considerable discrepancies of reading, which
                may bo explained partly from a difference of recension and partly as the result of
                the adaptation of these verses to their special sacrificial purpose. As regards the
                prose formulas, though only a few of them are actually referred to in the Rik, it is
