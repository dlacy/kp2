<p><span class="font1">Raleigh was sent to the Tower, where he remained till the 19th of March 1616. His estate of Sherborne, which he had&nbsp;transferred to his son, was taken by the king, who availed&nbsp;himself of a technical irregularity in the transfer. A sum of&nbsp;£8000 offered in compensation was only paid in part. Raleigh’s&nbsp;confinement was easy, and he applied himself to chemical&nbsp;experiments and literature. He had been known as one of&nbsp;the most poetical of the minor lyric poets of an age of poetry&nbsp;from his youth. In prison he composed many treatises, and&nbsp;the only volume of his vast </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the World</span><span class="font1"> published.&nbsp;He also invented an elixir which appears to have been a very&nbsp;formidable quack stimulant. Hope of release and of a renewal&nbsp;of activity never deserted him, and he strove to reach the car&nbsp;of the king by appealing to successive ministers and favourites.&nbsp;At last he secured his freedom in a way discreditable to all&nbsp;concerned. He promised the king to find a gold mine in Guiana&nbsp;without trenching on a Spanish possession. It must have been&nbsp;notorious to everybody that this was impossible, and the&nbsp;Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, warned the king that the&nbsp;Spaniards had settlements on the coast. The king, who was&nbsp;in need of money, replied that if Raleigh was guilty of piracy&nbsp;he should be executed on his return. Raleigh gave promises&nbsp;he obviously knew he could not keep, and sailed on the 17th of&nbsp;March 1617, relying on the chapter of accidents, and on vague&nbsp;intrigues he had entered into in Savoy and France. The expedition,&nbsp;on which the wreck of his fortune was spent, was ill-appointed&nbsp;and ill-manned. It reached the mouth of the Orinoco on the&nbsp;last day of 1617. Raleigh was ill with fever, and remained at&nbsp;Trinidad. He sent five small vessels up the Orinoco under his&nbsp;most trusted captain, Lawrence Keymis, with whom went his&nbsp;son Walter and a nephew. The expedition found a Spanish&nbsp;settlement on the way to the supposed mine, and a fight ensued&nbsp;in which Sir Walter’s son and several Spaniards were killed.&nbsp;After some days of bush fighting with the Spaniards, and&nbsp;of useless search for the mine, Keymis returned to Sir Walter&nbsp;with the news of his son’s death and his own utter ruin. Stung&nbsp;by Raleigh’s reproach Keymis killed himself, and then after&nbsp;a miserable scene of recriminations, hesitations and mutiny,&nbsp;the expedition returned home. Raleigh was arrested, and in&nbsp;pursuance of the king’s promise to Gondomar was executed&nbsp;under his old sentence on the 29th of October 1618. During his&nbsp;confinement he descended to some unworthy supplications and&nbsp;devices, but when he knew his end to be inevitable he died with&nbsp;serenity and dignity. His wife survived him, and he left a son,&nbsp;Carew Raleigh. His enmity to Spain made him a popular hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Authorities.—An edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Works</span><span class="font0"> in eight volumes was published in London in 1829.

<p><span class="font1">RALEIGH, the capital of North Carolina, U.S.A., and the county-seat of Wake county, about 145 m. N. by W. of Wilmington. Pop. (1890) 12,678; (1900) 13,643, of whom 5721&nbsp;were negroes; (1910, census) 19,218. Area 4 sq. m. It is&nbsp;served by the Southern, the Seaboard Air Line, the Raleigh &amp;&nbsp;Southport, and the Norfolk Southern railways. The city&nbsp;lies about 360 ft. above sea-level on ground sloping gently&nbsp;in all directions from its centre, where there is a beautiful park&nbsp;of 4 acres known as Union Square, in which is the State&nbsp;Capitol and from which extend four broad streets. On the&nbsp;western border of the city is Pullen Park (about 40 acres),&nbsp;including the campus of the College of Agriculture and Mechanic&nbsp;Arts; it was named in honour of the donor, R. Stanhope Pullen,&nbsp;who was also a benefactor of the college. The State Capitol&nbsp;(1840) is surmounted by a dome and modelled to some extent&nbsp;after the Parthenon and other buildings of ancient Greece;&nbsp;the first Capitol (begun in 1794) was burned in 1831. In the&nbsp;vicinity are the Governor’s Mansion, the Supreme Court Building, the State Library, the building of the State Department of&nbsp;Agriculture, housing the State Museum (of geology, mineralogy,&nbsp;agriculture and horticulture, botany, zoology, ethnology, &amp;c.),&nbsp;and the Post Office. Elsewhere are the County Court House,&nbsp;the State Hospital for the Insane (1856), founded through the&nbsp;efforts of Dorothea Lynde Dix, situated on Dix Hill and having&nbsp;in connexion with it a colony for epileptics; a state school for&nbsp;white blind, deaf and dumb (1845), and a state institute for negro deaf mutes and blind (1867) ; the state penitentiary (with&nbsp;a department for the criminal insane); a National Cemetery and&nbsp;a Confederate Cemetery; a Methodist Orphanage (1900) and a&nbsp;Roman Catholic Orphanage, the St Luke’s Home for old ladies&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(1895;</span><span class="font1"> under the King’s Daughters), a State (Confederate)&nbsp;Soldiers’ Home (1891), and three private hospitals and the Rex&nbsp;public hospital (1909). Raleigh is the seat of the North Carolina&nbsp;College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (1889), in connexion&nbsp;with which is an agricultural experiment station; of three&nbsp;schools for girls—Peace Institute (Presbyterian, 1857), St Mary’s&nbsp;School (Protestant Episcopal, 1842) and Meredith College&nbsp;(Baptist, 1891); of the medical department of the University&nbsp;of North Carolina; and of two schools for negroes—Shaw&nbsp;University (Baptist, 1865), with 530 students in 1908-1909,&nbsp;and St Augustine’s School (Protestant Episcopal, 1868), a&nbsp;training school, with 466 students in 1908-1909. In 1908 the&nbsp;State Library (founded 1841) contained 39,000 volumes, the&nbsp;Supreme Court Library (founded 1870) about 17,000 volumes&nbsp;and the Olivia Raney public library (founded 1901) 9250&nbsp;volumes. The city is the see of a Protestant Episcopal bishop.&nbsp;The principal industrial interests are trade in leaf tobacco and&nbsp;cotton raised in the vicinity, and the manufacture of cotton&nbsp;goods, phosphate fertilizers, foundry and machine-shop products,&nbsp;wooden-ware, &amp;c. The Seaboard Air Line and the Raleigh &amp;&nbsp;Southport railways have repair shops here. In 1905 the factory&nbsp;product was valued at $1,086,671, 14∙7% more than in 1900.&nbsp;Electric power is conveyed to the city from Buckhorn Falls, on&nbsp;the Cape Fear river, about 26 m. south of Raleigh, and from&nbsp;Milburnie on the Neuse river, 6 m. distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1788 the site of the city, then known as Wake Court House, was chosen for the capital of the state; and in 1792 the city was&nbsp;laid out and named in honour of Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1794&nbsp;the state legislature met here for the first time. Raleigh was&nbsp;incorporated in 1795 and was reincorporated in 1803; its&nbsp;present charter dates from 1899. General William T. Sherman’s&nbsp;army, on its march through the Carolinas, passed through the&nbsp;city on the 13th of April 1865. Raleigh was the birthplace of&nbsp;President Andrew Johnson; the house in which he was born&nbsp;has been removed to Pullen Park. By an extension of its&nbsp;boundaries the city nearly doubled its area and increased its&nbsp;population in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RALPH (d. 1122), archbishop of Canterbury, called Ralph de Turbine, or Ralph d’Escures from his father’s estate of&nbsp;Escures, near Séez in Normandy, entered the abbey of St&nbsp;Martin at Séez in 1079, and ten years later became abbot of this&nbsp;house. Soon afterwards he paid a visit to England, where his&nbsp;half-brother, Seffrid Pelochin, was bishop of Chichester, and&nbsp;in 1100 he took refuge in England from the violence of Robert&nbsp;of Belesme, passing some time with his friends St Anselm and&nbsp;Gundulf. In March 1108 he succeeded Gundulf as bishop of&nbsp;Rochester. After Anselm’s death in April 1109 Ralph acted as&nbsp;administrator of the see of Canterbury until April 1114, when&nbsp;he himself was chosen archbishop at Windsor. In this capacity&nbsp;he was very assertive of the rights of the archbishop of Canter-</span></p>
