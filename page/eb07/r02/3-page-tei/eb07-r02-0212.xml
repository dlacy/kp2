(b. s.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rope-making is the art of combining fibrous materials, by twisting in such a manner as to form a continuous flexible cord.</hi></p><p>We have before stated, that the fibres used for this purpose are those of flax and hemp ; the former for small lines and cords only, and the latter for all kinds of cords, from the smallest to the largest. The preparation and manufacture of hemp and flax into such articles as either are adapted for, being the same in both, we mean, in the following sketch of these operations, to speak of hemp as the material made use of. This article we obtain from Riga and St Petersburg, whence it is shipped for our ports in great bundles, weighing, according to quality, from forty-five to sixty-five poods each, the pood being equal to thirty-six pounds avoirdupois. On the arrival of the vessels, these great bundles are cut up, and the hemp is thrown from the hold in small bundles, bound at one end, and weighing each about twelve pounds. These small bundles are termed heads ; and in this condition the rope-manufacturer gets his raw material.</p><p>The fibres of hemp, of a good quality, should be long, fine, and thin ; smooth and glossy on the surface ; of a yellowish-green colour ; and free from spills or small pieces of the boon or woody fibre of the hemp plant, which remain after the operation of breaking ; and they should, above all, possess the essential qualities of strength and toughness.</p><p>Hemp loses many of its good qualities by lying long in warehouses ; and when shipped in a damp state it loses its glossy appearance, becomes what is termed rusted, and is then much weaker, and hard and disagreeable to work.</p><p>The operations of the rope-maker are carried on in the following order, viz.</p><p>1st, Hackling the hemp.</p><p>2dly, Spinning or twisting the fibres into threads or yarns.</p><p>3dly, Tarring the yarns.</p><p>4thly, Making the yarn into strands.</p><p>5thly, Laying or forming the strands into ropes, called hawser-laid ropes.</p><p>6thly, Laying or forming hawser-laid ropes into cable-laid ropes.</p><p>ls∕, <hi rend="italic">Hackling.—</hi>To prepare the fibres for the use of the spinner, they are drawn over pronged instruments called hackles, which clear from them the refuse, and split them into different degrees of fineness, to suit the size of thread into which they are to be spun.</p><p>Fig. 1 is a representation of a hackle of the largest kind, called a cag. Here <hi rend="italic">aa</hi>  is a strong board; and <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>  steel prongs, polished and tapered, and made very sharp at the point.</p><p>The prongs of the next size of hackle are smaller and closer set, and so on, diminishing to the finest size, which reduces the fibres to the last degree of tenuity.</p><p>The operation of hackling is performed in the following manner. The operator stands at a convenient distance in front of the hackles, which are fixed on a steady bench at a proper height. He then takes a bundle of hemp, and divides it into such portions as he can conveniently grasp. One of these he holds firmly by one end, and draws it over the hackle, beginning with tile end of the bunch farthest from his hand, and by repeated operations disentangles and splits the fibres nearly to where he grasps the bunch. He then takes hold of the finished end, and operates on the part which he before had grasped. To facilitate these operations, he from time to time oils the hemp with a little whale-oil. When the hemp is combed out and split as perfectly as the first size of hackle enables the workman to do, he carries it, if it be necessary for the purpose intended, to the next in degree, and so on to the last. The short fibres which are pulled out of the bunch by the hackle, and remain sticking to it, are collected from time to time by the workman, as they impede his progress, and are laid aside. They are afterwards drawn over the hackle to lay the fibres straight, and are, under the name of tow, used, in making inferior ropes.</p><p>As the workman finishes his handfuls of hemp, he lays them aside in bundles for the spinner.</p><p>The operation of hackling would seem to require little skill on the part of the workman ; but this is by no means the case, as bad workmanship would convert the greater part of the hemp into tow. Hackling is performed in a house, which ought, for convenience, to be near to where the threads are spun, that the spinners be not put to unnecessary expense of time in getting their stuff.</p><p><hi rend="italic">'i.dly, Spinning.—</hi>The place where the operation of spinning is carried on, is one division of a walk or alley termed the rope-walk, and is generally enclosed by walls, and roofed over ; and in some places where ropes and twine are made, the building is in two stories, the rope-yarns being spun below, and the twine in the loft above.</p><p>The walk for rope-yarns is, according to circumstances, from 600 to 1200 feet long, and the width is regulated by the extent of the business to be carried on. One end of the walk is termed the head or fore-end, and the other the foot or back-end ; at both ends the machines for communicating twist to the yarns are erected ; and along both sides of the walk, at equal distances, and opposite to each other, are erected posts. Between every pair of posts a rail stretches across the walk, at the height of eight feet above the ground ; and along the under side of the rail, hooks are fixed, on which the yarns are hung as they are spun ; and to one of the upright posts of each pair a large hook is fastened, on which the yarns arc hung when collected together. Fig. 2 shows this arrangement; <hi rend="italic">aaaa</hi>  being the upright posts,,</p><p>fc6 the rails stretching across the spinning walk, <hi rend="italic">ee</hi>  the hocks for the yarns, and <hi rend="italic">cc</hi>  the large hooks on which the collected mass of yarns is hung. At the head of the walk a stout post is fixed in the ground, and to it the yarns are fastened as they are finished. At the foot of the walk a similar post is fixed for the same purpose. These posts must be at that side of the walk on which the large hooks are fixed.</p><p>The walks on which small threads for twines and small cords are spun, have, in place of these rails and hooks, rails about three feet long, let loosely into mortises sunk in the top of upright posts, about three and a half feet above the ground ; and along the top of the rail upright pins are fixed, to keep the threads separate.</p><p>The spinning machines for rope-yarns consist of two up-</p></body></text></TEI>
