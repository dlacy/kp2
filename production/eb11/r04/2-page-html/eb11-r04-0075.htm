<p><span class="font2">Fig. 8 shows plan of the rostra as they existed under the Empire. We see an oblong platform about 78 ft. long and 11 ft. high above&nbsp;the level of the Forum; its ground floor, paved with&nbsp;herring-bone bricks, is 2 ft. 6 in. below the Forum paving.&nbsp;Its end and side walls are of tufa blocks, 2 ft. thick and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font2"> ft. wide, each carefully clamped to the next with wooden dovetail dowels. Its floor was supported by a series of travertine piers,&nbsp;carrying travertine lintels, on which the floor slabs rested. Outside&nbsp;it was completely lined with Greek marble and had a richly moulded&nbsp;plinth and cornice; the front wall was restored in 1904, and the&nbsp;fragments of the cornice replaced. A groove cut in the top of the&nbsp;cornice shows the place where marble cancelli wete fixed; one of&nbsp;the cornice blocks is partly without this groove, showing that the&nbsp;screen did not extend along the whole front of the rostra. This&nbsp;agrees with a relief on the arch of Constantine, representing the&nbsp;emperor making an oration from the rostra, with other buildings&nbsp;at this end of the Forum shown behind. In this relief the screen&nbsp;is shown with a break in the middle, so that the orator, standing&nbsp;in the centre, was visible from head to foot. Two tiers of large&nbsp;holes to hold the bronze rostra are drilled right through the tufa&nbsp;wall, and even through the travertine pilasters where one happens&nbsp;to come in the way; these holes show that there were nineteen&nbsp;rostra in the lower tier, and twenty above set over the intermediate&nbsp;spaces of the lower row. The back wall of the rostra is of concrete&nbsp;faced with brick. The inside space, under the main floor of the&nbsp;rostra, is coated thickly with stucco—the brick wall being studded&nbsp;in the usual way with iron nails to form a key for the plaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">immediately behind the rostra is a curved platform approached by steps from the side facing the Capitol. It has been much disputed&nbsp;whether this platform is earlier or later than the rostra; but&nbsp;the evidence of the construction at the point of juncture&nbsp;seems to show that the hemicycle is the earlier. When&nbsp;the arch of Severus was built, part of the platform of the rostra&nbsp;was cut away and a court of irregular shape was thus formed, from&nbsp;which the rostra was approached by steps. The front wall of the&nbsp;hemicycle was now exposed in its eastern half; this was faced&nbsp;with slabs of porta santa marble, pilasters of africano, and a moulded&nbsp;plinth of white marble, whose blocks bear the Greek characters&nbsp;T, A, E, Z, H, 0, K; the omissions make it clear that the&nbsp;blocks were removed from, some other building. A number of holes&nbsp;in the marble, some of which contain fragments of metal pins, show&nbsp;that bronze ornaments were at one time attached to the facing.&nbsp;The hemicycle has been identified (without sufficient reason) with&nbsp;the Graecostasis, a platform near the rostra reserved for foreign&nbsp;embassies (Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font2"> v. 155; Cic. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Q.F.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 1), which continued to&nbsp;exist throughout the imperial period and was restored by Antoninus&nbsp;Pius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Vita</span><span class="font2"> 9, 2). It is, however, far more likely that it represents&nbsp;the original form of the rostra as removed to the Forum according&nbsp;to Caesar’s design.@@When the oblong platform was built (perhaps&nbsp;by Trajan) it was approached from the back by the hemicycle. Tne&nbsp;bronze rostra on the imperial structure were believed to be the&nbsp;original beaks from Antium, moved from the old rostra (Floras,&nbsp;i. 11). On its marble platform stood many statues,@@</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> of Sulla,&nbsp;Pompey, two of Julius Caesar, and others (Dio Cass. xlii. 18&nbsp;and xliv. 4); these are represented on a bas-relief from the arch&nbsp;of Constantine. It is further commonly believed that the marble&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plutei</span><span class="font2"> which now stand in the centre of the Forum once decorated&nbsp;the rostra. Owing probably to the weight of, the many statues&nbsp;proving too much for the travertine piers, which are not set on&nbsp;their natural beds but endways, and therefore are vep^ weak, the&nbsp;structure seems to have given way at more than one time, and the&nbsp;floor has been supported by piers and arches of brick-faced concrete,</span></p>
