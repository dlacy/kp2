<p><span class="font1">to some extent into use in Italy is beyond question; for there is preserved in Marini’s collection the testament oi one Mannanes, executed at Ravenna in the reign of Justinian’s immediate successor Justin II.,&nbsp;in which the requirements of both Code and Novels are. scrupulously observed. Of other monuments of the same period that&nbsp;prove their currency in Italy several are referred to by Savigny&nbsp;in the second volume of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Roman Law in the Middle&nbsp;Ages,</span><span class="font1"> among which may be mentioned the Turin gloss of the&nbsp;Institutes, which Fitting ascribes to about the year 545,<sup>@@1</sup> and two&nbsp;little pieces known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictatum de consiliariis</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collectio&nbsp;de tutoribus.<sup>@@2 </sup></span><span class="font1">The invasion of the Lombards, the disturbance they&nbsp;caused in Italy for two centuries, and the barrier they formed&nbsp;between it and the rest of Europe militated against the spread of&nbsp;the Justinianian law northwards; but it was taught (from the 6th&nbsp;to the nth century) without much interruption at law schools in&nbsp;Rome, and also at Ravenna, the scat of the exarchs, to which (but&nbsp;this is doubtful) the school </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{studium)</span><span class="font1"> of Rome, revived by Justinian,&nbsp;is said to have been transferred in the nth century. By the&nbsp;Lombards, as their savagery toned down, the Roman law was so&nbsp;far recognized that they allowed it to be applied to the Romans living&nbsp;within their territory, and it is said even to have been taught in&nbsp;Pavia, which they had established as their capital. Their overthrow&nbsp;by Charlemagne opened an outlet for it beyond Italy; and there is&nbsp;evidence that in the 9th century Justinian's works, or some of them,&nbsp;were already circulating in the hands of the clergy in various parts&nbsp;of Europe. Yet there are few remains of any literature of this&nbsp;period indicating much acquaintance with them. The only writings&nbsp;worth mentioning are the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Summa Perusina,</span><span class="font1"> an abridgment&nbsp;of the first eight books of the Code, ascribed to the 7th century;&nbsp;the Lombardic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quaesliones ac Monita</span><span class="font1"> containing observations on the&nbsp;Germanic and Roman laws with texts drawn from the Institutes,&nbsp;the Digest, the Code and Julian’s Epitome, and supposed to have&nbsp;been written early in the nth century; the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brachylogus,<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font1">in large part a sort of abbreviated revision of Justinian’s Institutes,&nbsp;but with references also to his other books, which Fitting and&nbsp;others hold to have been written in France (perhaps Orleans),&nbsp;possibly by a pupil of Irnerius, about the very beginning of the&nbsp;12th century; and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petri Exceptiones legum Romanorum,</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;similar systematic exposition of the law in four books, probably&nbsp;written in the nth century earlier than Irnerius’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Summa.</span><span class="font1"> Both&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brachylogus</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petrus</span><span class="font1"> were mainly compiled from pure&nbsp;Justinianian sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Apart from these remains a word may here be said about the work of the glossarists.<sup>@@4</sup> It was at the very end of the nth century&nbsp;that at the law school of Bologna, then under the guidance&nbsp;of the celebrated Irnerius, the study of Roman law began&nbsp;somewhat suddenly to attract students from all parts of&nbsp;Europe. Partly through ignorance and partly through the&nbsp;action of the clergy, the parts of the Justinianian legislation that had&nbsp;hitherto been in ordinary use were the Institutes, the Code and the&nbsp;Novels. The first, from its elementary character, had naturally&nbsp;commended itself; the Code and the Novels, with their abundant&nbsp;legislation on matters ecclesiastical, were in many respects charters&nbsp;of the church’s privileges, and were prized accordingly; but the&nbsp;Digest, as being the work of pagan jurists, had been looked on askance&nbsp;and practically little used. The Code and the Novels, however,&nbsp;with their modicum of wheat concealed in a great quantity of&nbsp;chaff, offered little attraction to laymen of intelligence; and,&nbsp;when under the guidance of Irnerius their attention was first concentrated on the Digest, it must have come to them as a sort of&nbsp;revelation. Dogmatic and exegetic teaching of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in all its parts was actively begun, and a new school arose called the&nbsp;glossarists </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{glossatores),</span><span class="font1"> of whom Irnerius has always been rightly&nbsp;regarded, as the founder. This great man, who is said to have&nbsp;been trained both in logic and rhetoric and to have afterwards&nbsp;studied and taught law at Rome before coming to Bologna, w<sup>r</sup>as more&nbsp;than a glossator. He was also the first of the medievalists to treat&nbsp;the law in a scientific way. In his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Summa Codicis</span><span class="font1"> (a work attributed&nbsp;to him by Fitting on evidence which seems almost conclusive) he&nbsp;produced for his contemporaries and successors an independently&nbsp;planned and. so far systematic manual of the subject-matter of the&nbsp;Code, omitting the last three books.<sup>@@5</sup> The subject was treated in&nbsp;full relation to the other parts of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris,</span><span class="font1"> but follows in&nbsp;general the titles of the Code. The glossators got their name from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">glossae, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> marginal and interlinear annotations (both grammatical and doctrinal) with which they furnished the texts of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris</span><span class="font1"> which were in their hands. They also wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">summae, casus, brocarda,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c., for use both in the courts and the.schools,&nbsp;and occasionally special treatises. They confined their work&nbsp;entirely to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris,</span><span class="font1"> being almost wholly ignorant of the&nbsp;history of the law. Beginning with Irnerius, the school lasted for&nbsp;about a century and a half, and ended with Franciscus Accursius,&nbsp;who died in 1260 after having made a systematic but summarized&nbsp;collection of the glosses of his predecessors, which was afterwards&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Glossa Ordinaria</span><span class="font1"> or “ The Great Gloss.” Among the&nbsp;more famous representatives of the school (other than Irnerius)&nbsp;were, in the 12th century, Bulgarus, Martinus, Jacobus and Hugo,&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quattuor doctores,</span><span class="font1"> and Accursius himself. To these&nbsp;may be added Placcntinus and Vacarius of the 12th and Azo&nbsp;and Odofrcdus of the 13th century. The Digest, as used by the&nbsp;glossarists, was divided into three parts, known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digestum Vetus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(books 1-24, tit. 2), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Infortiatum</span><span class="font1"> (books 24, tit- 3-38), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digestum&nbsp;Novum</span><span class="font1"> (books 39 to the end). The manuscripts of these, as used&nbsp;by the glossarists, are called the Vulgate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{lectio Vulgate),</span><span class="font1"> to distinguish&nbsp;them from the Florentine Manuscript </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{lectio Pisana),</span><span class="font1"> on which,&nbsp;indeed (or on the same original source as it), they were probably all&nbsp;primarily based, but from which, as far at least as book 33, they&nbsp;varied in numerous readings. The historical explanation of the&nbsp;cause of this just-mentioned threefold division is given by Mommsen&nbsp;in the preface to his larger edition of the Digest, to which it will be&nbsp;sufficient to refer.<sup>@@6 </sup>The whole </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris was</span><span class="font1"> by the glossarists&nbsp;distributed into five volumes, viz. the three just named; a fourth,&nbsp;containing the first nine books of the Code; and the fifth, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">volu-men parvum legum,</span><span class="font1"> containing the Institutes; 134 of the Novels&nbsp;in Latin (known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Authenticum<sup>@@7</sup></span><span class="font1">; and the last three books of&nbsp;the Code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The success of the Accursian gloss was rather detrimental to scientific development of the law. It became a sort of code in&nbsp;itself which both in the schools and the courts tended to supersede&nbsp;the texts of Justinian. The intelligent study of the Sources was&nbsp;neglected while, lawyers devoted themselves to subtle distinctions&nbsp;and useless divisions of subject-matter. It led to the application&nbsp;during the 14th and 15th centuries of the methods of scholasticism&nbsp;to the Roman law. The authors of this scholastic jurisprudence,&nbsp;which prevailed during the greater part of these centuries, have&nbsp;been called post-glossators and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scribentes</span><span class="font1"> or commentators. Their&nbsp;most noted representative was Bartolus (1314-1357), after whom&nbsp;they were often called Bartolists. This school, however (mainly&nbsp;Italian), did much towards developing a definite system of common&nbsp;law in Italy based on the Roman, and thereby facilitated the&nbsp;reception of Roman law in Germany and other countries.<sup>@@8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the 16th century a new start or, so to say, second renaissance was given to the Roman law. The study of classical antiquities,&nbsp;so active on the side of literature, extended to jurisprudence also.&nbsp;The juridical writings which had been handed down from the&nbsp;Romans ceased to be regarded purely as positive law, binding according to the letter, but as a part of ancient tradition whose spirit as&nbsp;well as form .must be examined by the light of the past. Among&nbsp;the pioneers in this new method, to whom the name of Humanists&nbsp;has been given, must be specially mentioned Alciatus (1492-1540),&nbsp;Cujacius (1522-1590) and Donellus (1527-1591). Medievalism has&nbsp;passed away, and with these jurists began what has been called the&nbsp;modern Roman law, to describe which, however, is entirely beyond&nbsp;the province of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

<p><span class="font1">ROMANOS, called o jueXwSos, Greek hymn-writer, “ the Pindar of rhythmic poetry,” was born at Emesa (Homs) in&nbsp;Syria. From the scanty notices of his life we learn that he&nbsp;resided in Constantinople during the reign of the emperor&nbsp;Anastasius.<sup>@@9</sup> Having officiated as a deacon in the church of&nbsp;the Resurrection at Berytus, he removed to Constantinople,&nbsp;where he was attached to the churches of Blachernae and&nbsp;Cyrus. According to the legend, when he was asleep in the&nbsp;last-named church, the Virgin appeared to him and commanded&nbsp;him to eat a scroll. On awaking (it was Christmas Day), he&nbsp;immediately mounted the pulpit, and gave forth his famous&nbsp;hymn on the Nativity. Romanos is said to have composed&nbsp;more than 1000 similar hymns or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">contakia</span><span class="font1"> (Gr. xorr^xtor,&nbsp;“ scroll ”) celebrating the festivals of the ecclesiastical year,&nbsp;the lives of the saints and other sacred subjects—on the death&nbsp;of a monk (extremely impressive); the last judgment; the&nbsp;treachery of Judas; the martyrdom of St Stephen; Simeon</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
