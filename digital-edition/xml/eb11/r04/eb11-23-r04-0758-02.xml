                <p><label>ROTHSCHILD</label> the name of a Jewish family which has acquired an
                    unexampled position from the magnitude of its financial transactions. The
                    original name was Bauer, the founder of the house being <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Mayer Anselm</hi> (1743-1812), the son of Anselm Moses Bauer, a small
                    Jewish merchant of Frankfort-on-the-Main. His father wished him to become a
                    rabbi, but he set up as a money-lender at the sign of the “ Red Shield ” <hi
                        rend="italic">{Rothschild)</hi> in the Frankfort Judengasse. He had already
                    acquired some standing as a banker when his numismatic tastes obtained for him
                    the friendship of William, ninth landgrave and afterwards elector of
                    Hesse-Cassel, who in 1801 made him his agent. In the following year Rothschild
                    negotiated his first great government Ioan, ten million thalers for the Danish
                    government. When the landgrave was compelled to flee from his capital on the
                    entry of the French, he placed his silver and other bulky treasures in the hands
                    of Rothschild, who, not without considerable risk, took charge of them and
                    buried them, it is said, in a comer of his garden, whence he dug them up as
                    opportunity arose for disposing of them. This he did to such advantage as to be
                    able afterwards to return their value to the elector at 5% interest. He died at
                    Frankfort on the 19th of September 1812, leaving ten children, five sons and
                    five daughters. Branches of the business were established at Vienna, London,
                    Paris and Naples, each being in charge of one of the sons, the chief of the firm
                    always residing at Frankfort. By a system of co-operation and joint counsels,
                    aided by the skilful employment of subordinate agents, they obtained unexampled
                    opportunities of acquiring an accurate knowledge of the condition of the
                    financial market, and practically embraced the whole of Europe within their
                    financial network. The unity of the interests of the several members of the firm
                    has been preserved by the system of intermarriages which has been the general
                    practice of the descendants of the five brothers. Each of the brothers received
                    in 1815 from Austria the privilege of hereditary landowners, and in 1822 they
                    were created barons by the same country. The charge of the Frankfort house
                    devolved on the eldest, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anselm Mayer</hi> (1773-1855), born
                    on the 12th of June 1773, who was chosen a member of the royal Prussian privy
                    council of commerce, and, in 1820, Bavarian consul and court banker. The Vienna
                    branch was undertaken by <hi rend="smallcaps">Solomon</hi> (1774-1826), born on
                    the 9th of December 1774, who entered into intimate relations with Prince
                    Metternich, which contributed in no small degree to bring about the connexion of
                    the firm with the allied powers. The third brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nathan
                        Mayer</hi> (1777-1836), born on the 16th of September 1777, has, however,
                    generally been regarded as the financial genius of the family, and the chief
                    originator of the transactions which have created for the house its unexampled
                    position in the financial world. He went to Manchester about 1800 to act as a
                    purchaser for his father of manufactured goods; but at the end of five years he
                    removed to London. The boldness and skill of his financial transactions, which
                    caused him at first to be regarded as unsafe by the leading banking firms and
                    financial merchants, later awakened their admiration and envy. By the employment
                    of carrier-pigeons and of fast-sailing boats of his own for the transmission of
                    news he was able to utilize to the best advantage his special sources of
                    information, while no one was a greater adept in the art of promoting the rise
                    and fall of the stocks. The colossal influence of the house dates from an
                    operation of his in 1810. In that year Wellington made some drafts which the
                    English government could not meet; these were purchased by Rothschild at a
                    liberal discount, and renewed to the government, which finally redeemed at par.
                    From this time the allied powers negotiated Ioans to carry on the war against
                    Napoleon chiefly through the house of Rothschild. Rothschild never lost faith in
                    the ultimate overthrow of Napoleon, his all being virtually staked on the issue
                    of the contest. He is said to have been present at the battle of Waterloo. Being
                    able to transmit to London private information of the allied success several
                    hours before it reached the public, he effected an immense profit by the
                    purchase of stock, which had been depressed on the news of Blucher’s defeat two
                    days previously. Rothschild was the first to popularize foreign loans in Britain
                    by fixing the rate in sterling money and making the dividends payable in London
                    and not in foreign capitals. Latterly he became the financial agent of nearly
                    every civilized government, although persistently declining contracts for Spain
                    or the American States. He did not confine himself to</p>

                <p>operations on a large scale, but on the contrary made it a principle to despise
                    or neglect no feasible opportunity of transacting business, while at the same
                    time his operations gradually extended to every quarter of the globe. He died on
                    the 28th of July 1836, and was succeeded in the management of the London house
                    by his son Lionel (1808-1879), born on the 22nd of November 1808, whose name is
                    associated with the removal of the civil disabilities of the Jews, He was
                    elected a member for the City of London in 1847, and again in 1849 and 1852, but
                    it was not till 1858 that the joint operation of an act of parliament and a
                    resolution of the House of Commons, allowing the omission from the oath of the
                    words to which as a Jew he conscientiously objected, rendered it possible for
                    him to take his seat. He continued to represent the City of London till 1874.
                    His eldest son, Nathan (b. 1840), was created a peer as Baron Rothschild in
                    1885. Jacob (1792-1868), the youngest of the original brothers, was entrusted
                    with the mission of starting the business in Paris after the restoration of the
                    Bourbons, for whom he negotiated large loans. At the Revolution of 1848 he was a
                    heavy loser, and had also to be protected for a time by a special guard. It was
                    by his capital that the earliest railways were constructed in France; the
                    profits he obtained from the speculation were very large. He died on the 15th of
                    November 1868. The Naples branch was superintended by another of the brothers,
                    Karl (1780-1855). It was always the least important of the five, and after the
                    annexation of Naples to Italy in 1860 it was discontinued.</p>
