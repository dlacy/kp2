They at present compose three genera, as follows :</p><p>In Stenodactvels the tail is round, the toes striated beneath, and dentated on the edges. <hi rend="italic">Sten. guttatus</hi>  is an Egyptian species, of a gray colour, sprinkled with whitish spots; the skin smooth. In Gymxodactylus, Spix, the toes are slender and bare, and the tail rounded. Example, <hi rend="italic">Gym. gechoides,</hi>  Spix. In Phyllurus, Cuv., the toes resemble those of the preceding ; but the tail is flattened horizontally, and shaped like a leaf. The only known species is <hi rend="italic">Ph. platura,</hi>  from New South Wales, described by White under the name of broad-tailed lizard.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  It measures about six inches in length, and is of a brownish-gray colour, beset with tubercles. (See Plate CCCCXXXII. fig. 3.)</p><p>FAMILY V—CHAMÆLEONIDÆ. CAMELEONS.</p><p>This family consists solely of the genus Chamæleo, distinguished by the following characters. The entire surface is chagrined with small granular scales, the body is compressed, the dorsal edge narrow ; the tail is rounded and prehensile. There are five toes on each foot, arranged as it were in two groups, three in one, and two in the other, in some measure resembling the foot of a scansorial bird ; but the toes of each group are connate, or enclosed within the skin, as far as the claws. The tongue is fleshy, cylindrical, extensile, and of great length. The teeth are trilobed. The eyes are large in themselves, but almost entirely covered over by the skin, except a small opening opposite the pupil ; and each eye has the power of movement independent of the other. There are no external ears, and the occiput rises in a pyramidal form. The first ribs unite with the sternum, and the succeeding ones meet each other so as to form a circle around the abdomen. The lungs are of vast extent, and according to their state of collapse or inflation, greatly affect the form and aspect of the animal. This, with its long power of abstinence, may have given rise to the common belief that it feeds on air. @@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p>Cameleons are insectivorous reptiles, of which the slow pace, the extraordinary form, the awkward movements, the vivacity of eye, and the marvellous rapidity of tongue, have excited the wonder of mankind from the earliest ages. Their change of colour, by no means so marked or sudden as supposed, has nothing to do with the hue of the objects by which they are surrounded, but bears relation physically to the degree of light or obscurity to which they are exposed, morally to the state of their own feelings of fear or anger, and physiologically and directly to the action of the lungs upon the circulating system. “ En effet,” says Cuvier, “leur poumon les rend plus ou moins transparents, contraint plus ou moins le sang à refluer vers la peau, colore même ce fluide plus ou moins vivement, selon qu’il se remplit ou se vide d’air.” “ The general or usual colour in the chameleon,” says Dr Shaw, “ so far as I have bcen able to ascertain from my own observation of such as have been brought into this country in a living state, are from a bluish-ash colour (its natural tinge) to a green and sometimes yellowish colour, spotted unequally with red. If the animal be exposed to a full sunshine, the unilluminated side generally appears, within the space of some minutes, of a pale yellow, with large rounded patches or spots of red brown. On reversing the situation of the animal the same change takes place in an opposite direction, the side which was before in the shade now becoming either brown or ash colour, while the other side becomes yellow and red ; but these changes are subject to much variety, both as to intensity of colours and disposition of spots.” @@<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p><p>Authors of all ages have differed greatly in opinion regarding the causes of the change of colour in cameleons. The phenomenon, though remarkable, and strongly exemplified in these creatures, is by no means peculiar to them, but occurs, as we have noted in the course of this article, among many others of the reptile race, especially in such as, the general envelope not adhering closely to the muscles, receive a portion of air beneath the skin. It is also observable in many mollusca, particularly the cuttle-fish tribe. But to recur to the cameleon. Aristotle and many other authors have maintained that the change of colour only took place when the animal inflated itself. Pliny repeats the opinion (which has since prevailed) that it assumed the colours of the bodies by which it was surrounded, with the exception of red and white. Wormius was among the first to maintain that the changes in question were due to the emotions of the reptile. Solinus assigns as the cause the reflexion of the luminous rays. Kircher supports the theory of volition and emotion. Goddard adopts the same explanation, with the addition that the colours at the same time bear a relation to neighbouring bodies. Hasselquist and Linnæus refer to the pigmentum as the cause. Finally, the majority of modern authors who have written on the subject (and their name is legion) have sought to explain the phenomenon either by the modifications of the respiratory system, by these modifications combined with the state of the pulmonary' circulation, or by the transposition of the various layers which are believed to exist in the pigmentum.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p><p>We may state briefly in regard to the geographical distribution of the cameleons, that Africa is their characteristic country. Of the fourteen species known to naturalists, the whole occur there or in the adjacent islands, especially Madagascar ; three species, however, are not exclusively African, <hi rend="italic">Cham, dilepis,</hi>  Leach, being found in Georgia, <hi rend="italic">Cham, vulgaris</hi>  in the south of Europe, and <hi rend="italic">Cham, bifidus </hi>in continental India, the Moluccas, Isle of France, and New Holland. They are thus entirely unknown in America.</p><p>These reptiles dwell habitually among shrubs or trees. “ Nous avons observé,” says M. Bory de St Vincent, “ des caméléons en liberté, fixés sur les rameaux des arbustes, qu’ils tenaient fortement serrés entre leur doigts, à peu près comme le font les perroquets dont le pied présente une certaine analogie avec les leurs ; ils étaient aussi immobiles que s’ils eussent été des imitations artificielles. Leurs yeux seulement, dont la prunelle brillait comme une pierre précieuse au milieu d’une globe blanchâtre percé d’un petit trou étincelant, roulaient en tout sens, et tandis que l’un regardait par devant, l’autre observait les objets situés en arrière. Quelquefois le mouvement anguleux d’une pâte comme disloquée, lentement suivi de celui de la suivante et du déroulement de la queue, qui servait de cinquième point d’appui au caméléon, déterminait un tardif avancement de quelques lignes.
