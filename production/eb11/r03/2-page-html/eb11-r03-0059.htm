<p><span class="font1">and eagerly confirmed. He was pronounced guilty of rapine, incendiarism, incest, assassination and heresy. Consequently&nbsp;he was sentenced to the deprivation of his state (which was&nbsp;probably the main object of the trial), and to be burnt alive as&nbsp;a heretic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This sentence, however, could not easily be executed, and Sigismondo was only burnt in effigy. But the pope marked&nbsp;the intensity of his hatred by causing the dummy to be carved&nbsp;and dressed with such lifelike resemblance that he was almost&nbsp;able to persuade himself that his hated enemy was really consumed in the flames. Malatesta could afford to laugh at this&nbsp;farce, but he nevertheless prepared in haste for a desperate&nbsp;defence (1462). He knew that the bishop Vitelleschi, together&nbsp;with the duke of Urbino and his own brother Novello Malatesta,&nbsp;lord of Cesena, were advancing against him in force; and, being&nbsp;defeated by them at Pian di Marotta, he was driven to Rome&nbsp;in 1463 to again make submission to the pope. This time he&nbsp;was stripped of all his possessions excepting the city of Rimini&nbsp;and a neighbouring castle, but the sentence of excommunication&nbsp;was withdrawn. The once mighty tyrant of Rimini found&nbsp;himself reduced to penury with a state chiefly composed of a&nbsp;single town. He therefore took service with the Venetians,&nbsp;and in 1464 had the command of an expedition to the Morea.&nbsp;Here his movements were so hampered by the interference of&nbsp;the commissioners of the republic that, with all his valour, he&nbsp;could achieve no decisive success. In 1466 he was able to return&nbsp;to Rimini, for Pius II. was dead, and the new pope, Paul II.,&nbsp;was less hostile to him. Indeed, the latter offered to give him&nbsp;Spoleto and Foligno, taking Rimini in exchange; but Malatesta&nbsp;was so enraged by the proposal that he went to Rome with a&nbsp;dagger concealed on his person, on purpose to kill the pope.&nbsp;But, being forewarned, Paul received him with great ceremony,&nbsp;and surrounded by cardinals prepared for defence; whereupon&nbsp;Sigismondo changed his mind, fell on his knees and implored&nbsp;forgiveness. His star had now set for ever. For sheer subsistence he had to hire his sword to the pope and quell petty&nbsp;rebellions with a handful of men. At last, his health failing,&nbsp;he returned to his family, and died in Rimini on the 7th of&nbsp;October 1468, aged fifty-one years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was succeeded, according to his desire, by Isotta and his son Sallustio. But there was an illegitimate elder son by&nbsp;another mother, named Roberto Malatesta, a valiant and&nbsp;unscrupulous soldier. Befriended by the pope, this man&nbsp;undertook to conquer Rimini for the Holy See, but came there&nbsp;to further his own ends instead (20th October 1469), and, while&nbsp;feigning a desire to share the government with Isotta and her&nbsp;son, resolved, sooner or later, to seize it for himself. This&nbsp;aroused the pope’s wrath, and Roberto instantly prepared for&nbsp;defence. Finding an ally in the duke of Urbino, whose eyes&nbsp;were now opened to the aggressive policy of the church, he was&nbsp;able to repulse its forces. Paul II. died soon after, and was&nbsp;succeeded by Sixtus IV. Roberto’s position was now mere&nbsp;secure, and in order to strengthen his recent alliance he betrothed&nbsp;himself to the daughter of the duke of Urbino. The next step&nbsp;was to dispose of his rival kindred. On the 8th of August 1470&nbsp;Isotta’s son was found murdered in a well belonging to the&nbsp;Marcheselli family; and a bloodstained sword, placed in their&nbsp;courtyard by Roberto, made it appear as though they had&nbsp;been guilty of the crime. Towards the end of the same year&nbsp;Isotta died also, apparently of a slow fever, but really, it was&nbsp;believed, by poison. Another of her sons, Valerio, bom in&nbsp;1453, still lived, but he was openly put to death by Roberto&nbsp;on a trumped-up charge of treason. In 1475 the new tyrant&nbsp;celebrated his nuptials with the duke of Urbino’s daughter,&nbsp;and, being again taken into favour by the pope, valiantly&nbsp;defended him in Rome against the attacks of the duke of&nbsp;Calabria, and died there in 1482 of the hardships endured in&nbsp;the war. His widow was left regent during the minority of his&nbsp;son Pandolfo, who was nicknamed Pandolfaccio on account&nbsp;of his evil nature. Directly he was of age, he seized the reins of&nbsp;government by killing some relations who had plotted against&nbsp;him, and crushed another conspiracy in the same way. A&nbsp;daring soldier, he distinguished himself at the battle of the&nbsp;Taro against the French; but his tyranny made him hated&nbsp;by his subjects. In 1500, when Ccsare Borgia fell on Romagna&nbsp;with violence and fraud, this Malatesta shared the fate of&nbsp;other petty tyrants and had to fly for his life. After the fall&nbsp;of the Borgia he returned, but, being bitterly detested by his&nbsp;people, decided to sell his rights to the Venetians, who had long&nbsp;desired to possess Rimini, and who gave him in exchange&nbsp;the town of Cittadella, some ready money, and a pension for&nbsp;life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This arrangement was naturally disapproved by Rome, and especially by Julius IL; he therefore contrived the league&nbsp;of Cambray on purpose to ruin the Venetians, who were crush-ingly defeated in 1509. Thereupon the pope, having accomplished his own ends, made alliance with the Venetians, who&nbsp;were now prostrate at his feet, and, with them, the Spaniards&nbsp;and the Swiss, fought against the French at Ravenna in 1512.&nbsp;Here the French were victors, but owing to their heavy losses&nbsp;and the death of their renowned leader, Gaston de Foix, were&nbsp;compelled to retreat. Thus Julius became master of Rimini&nbsp;and the other coveted lands. Malatesta made more than one&nbsp;attempt to win back his city, but always in vain, for his subjects&nbsp;preferred the papal rule, and in 1528 Pope Clement VII. became&nbsp;definite master of the town. Thus, after two hundred and&nbsp;fifty years, the sway of the Malatesta came to an end, and&nbsp;Pandolfo was reduced to beggary. He died in 1534, leaving&nbsp;a daughter and two sons in great poverty. The elder, Sigis-mondo, after various military adventures, died at Reggio&nbsp;d’Emilia in 1543; and Malatesta, the younger, went to fight&nbsp;in the Scotch and English wars, and was never heard of again.&nbsp;Sigismondo had left male heirs who made another attempt&nbsp;to regain Rimini in 1555, but Pope Paul IV. declared them&nbsp;deposed in perpetuity in punishment of Pandolfaccio’s misdeeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From that time the Malatesta became citizens of Venice their names were inscribed in the Golden Book, and they were&nbsp;admitted to the grand council. With the death, in 1716, of&nbsp;Christina Malatesta, the wife of Niccolo Boldu, the Rimini&nbsp;branch of the family became extinct. The descendants of&nbsp;Giovanm, brother of Malatesta da Verrucchio, who married one&nbsp;of the Sogliano, were known as the Sogliano-Malatesta. The&nbsp;representatives of this branch settled in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of Rimini practically ends with its independence. It fell into obscurity under the rule of the popes, and was not&nbsp;again mentioned in history until, in 1831 and 1845, it began&nbsp;taking a prominent part in the revolutionary movements&nbsp;against papal despotism and in favour of Italian independence.</span></p>
