Marius set the example of composing armies out of this degenerate city rabble; and even when this example was not followed, it was still found necessary to continue the distributions of corn, together with the public shows of gladiators and wild beasts in the amphitheatre. To these Nero had added supplies of wine and animal food <hi rend="italic">(congiaria et viscerationes);</hi>  so that the populace was both amused and fed at the public expense, while the weight of the tyranny was chiefly borne by the most distinguished class of citizens, the senate, and the nobility ; and heaviest by the most illustrious. To such a state of affairs the degenerate populace had little to object; but men of rank and merit groaned beneath an oppression no longer to be endured.</p><p>The provinces, however, were the first to make an attempt to throw off the intolerable yoke. Julius Vindex raised the standard of revolt in western Gaul. The army in Spain proclaimed their general, Galba, emperor ; and they were joined by the troops in Lusitania, commanded by Otho. The intelligence of these revolts filled Nero with consternation ; from which he was somewhat relieved by the tidings of the defeat of Vindex by Virginius, who had maintained his allegiance. This joy was of short duration ; for Nym-phidius, colleague of Tigellinus in the command of the prætorian guards, found means to persuade these troops to declare for Galba. The ruin of the emperor was now inevitable. Bereft of friends, of courage, and of presence of mind, he fled in trepidation disguised from the city, found a temporary refuge in the house of his freedman, Phaon, and hearing the trampling of horsemen who had been sent in pursuit of him, stabbed himself in the throat with a dagger, and miserably ended his miserable life.</p><p>Servius Sulpitius Galba was universally received as emperor after the death of Nero ; although Nymphidius attempted to take advantage of his slow progress towards Rome from Spain, and to get himself raised to the throne by the prætorian guards. Virginius Rufus, who had defeated Vindex, voluntarily submitted to Galba, as did also the armies in other parts of the empire. Strengthened by this ready reception, Galba endeavoured to abridge the dangerous power of the prætorian guards. Habituated to the rigid discipline of the camp, he exerted himself to restore somewhat of the ancient and hardy virtues of the republic, discountenanced sloth, idleness, and luxury, and even exhibited a penurious meanness of temper, unbecoming his exalted station, giving colour to the accusations of avarice which were made against him. The legions stationed in upper Germany, who had been somewhat tardy in acknowledging his elevation to the throne, began to be more disaffected, and to threaten to raise their own general, Vitellius, to the possession of imperial power. With a view to strengthen his tenure of empire, Galba appointed Licinius Piso, a youth of high promise, to be his successor. To this Otho had aspired, and immediately plotted the death of Galba. He readily secured the favour of the prætorian guards, who equally feared and hated the rigid discipline of the emperor. A revolt speedily ensued ; Galba prepared to defend his power ; and a contest taking place in the forum, the aged emperor was thrown down and trampled to death, after a reign of only seven months.</p><p>Scarcely had Otho seized upon the sceptre, when he found himself engaged in a contest with Vitellius, who had</p><p>been proclaimed emperor by his soldiers. The new competitor for imperial sway was joined by Valens and Cæcina, and began his march towards Italy at the head of a power-ful army. Otho marched to oppose him. The antagonists met at a little village called Bedriacum, near the banks of the Po, and a severe and bloody engagement took place. Victory was for some time doubtful ; but the superior discipline of Vitellius’s army prevailed, and Otho was defeat</p><lb/><p>ed with great slaughter. Seeing his prospects desperate, Otho gave up the contest, thanked his troops for their fidelity, and put an end to his own life, after a brief reign of about three months.</p><p>Vitellius began his reign by endeavouring to conciliate the favour of the populace and the troops by large donations and expensive amusements. He then gave a loose rein to his own debasing appetites, of which the chief was absolute gluttony of the very grossest kind. It is almost incredible, though stated by historians, that in less than four months he expended on the mere luxuries of the table a sum equal to about seven millions sterling. This bloated and pampered ruler was soon regarded by all his subjects with contempt and disgust. The unrestrained licentiousness of the soldiery tended equally to make his reign hated and feared by all w ho were exposed to the insults and outrages in which they indulged. To supply the funds necessary for the maintenance of his excessive luxury, he resorted to the too prevalent custom of listening to the accusations of spies, and putting to death all such accused persons, that he might seize upon their property.</p><p>While thus wallowing in the indulgence of the most debasing appetites, Vitellius was startled by tidings of a very alarming nature. During the reign of Nero an insurrection had broken out in Judea, and Vespasian had been sent to take the command of the army in Syria. The Jews made a desperate resistance, disputing, with almost invincible hardihood and indomitable bravery, every inch of their sacred territory. But this resistance, while it detained Vespasian in that country at the head of a powerful army, served only to mature their own fate. He had sent his own son, Titus, to offer his allegiance to Galba ; but before his arrival ∙Galba was dead, and Otho and Vitellius were contending for the empire. Titus returned to his fathcr for instructions; and though Vespasian appeared ready to acknowledge Vitellius, his own troops were eager to raise him to the sovereignty. Mucianus, governor of Syria, and all the tributary eastern monarchs, urged him to comply with the wishes of his army, and his reluctance, real or feigned, yielded to their joint remonstrances. No sooner had he commenced his march tow<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ards Europe, than the Illyrian and Pannonian armies declared in his favour ; and that of Illyricum, under the command of Antonius Primus, crossed the Alps and marched towards Rome to dethrone Vitellius. The Vitellian army, commanded by Cæcina, encountered that of Antonins near Cremona, byt was defeated with great loss, and the city was taken. Antonius continued to advance on Rome, and crossed the passes of theAppen-nines while the emperor was hastening to secure them. Vitellius fled to Rome, which was soon invested by the victorious army of Antonius. An insurrectionary tumult arose in the city itself, during which the Capitol was burned to the ground, and Sabinus, the brother of Vespasian, was killed. The troops of Antonius at length forced an entrance into the city, stormed the quarters ofthe prætorian guards, and put those turbulent bands to the sword. Vitellius endeavoured to conceal himself, but was discovered, dragged through the streets to the place of punishment for common</p><p>malefactors, put to death in the most ignominious manner, and his mangled carcass cast into the Tiber amidst the execrations of the multitude. Eight months and five days had this despicable wretch seemed to sway the sceptre of supreme dominion, when thus ovet taken by the due reward of his debauchery and crimes.</p><p>Flavius Vespasian obtained possession of the throne in his fifty-ninth year, and became the founder of a dynasty which gave three emperors to Rome. He was a man of rare and excellent virtues, thoroughly matured by a life spent in the exercise of public duties, and with no object superior to that of promoting the public welfare.
