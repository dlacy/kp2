<p><span class="font0">right posts, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aaa,</span><span class="font0"> fig. 3, between which the wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> is hung on its axis c. A belt from this&nbsp;wheel passes over and gives&nbsp;motion to a number of small&nbsp;pulleys, called whirls, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ddd,</span><span class="font0"> inserted in a circular arc </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">called the head, fixed to the&nbsp;top of the posts. The axis of&nbsp;each of these pulleys is prolonged in front of the head,&nbsp;and bent into a hook, as shown&nbsp;more distinctly at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f;</span><span class="font0"> and on&nbsp;this hook the fibres of hemp&nbsp;are hung to be twisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The spinning-wheel for the smaller sorts ot threads differs&nbsp;from this chiefly in being smaller, and having the parts slightly modified to suit the diminution of size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The operation of spinning is conducted as follows. The&nbsp;spinner takes a bundle of hemp of sufficient size to make&nbsp;one or more threads the whole length of the walk ; he puts&nbsp;this bundle round his waist, the bight or double being in&nbsp;front, and the ends passing each other at his back ; and he&nbsp;secures it in this position by buckling a strap round it, or by&nbsp;fastening it with his apron. He then draws out from the&nbsp;face of his bundle as many fibres as he thinks will make the&nbsp;size of yarn required ; the bight of these fibres he hangs on&nbsp;one of the whirl-hooks, and the wheel being now turned by&nbsp;an assistant, it throws twist or turn into the fibres. The&nbsp;spinner having laid a piece of thick woollen cloth in the&nbsp;hollow of his right hand, with the end hanging over his forefinger, grasps with it the fibres he had drawn out, pressing&nbsp;them firmly with his thumb and forefinger, the interposed&nbsp;cloth preserving his fingers from being cut by the fibres as&nbsp;they pass. He now walks backward down the walk, that is,&nbsp;from the head to the foot, the wheel-man all the while&nbsp;turning the wheel just so fast as to keep the turn or twist&nbsp;up to the spinner, of which he is admonished by signs made&nbsp;by the left hand of the latter, or, in complete establishments, by a bell, the cord of which traverses the walk. The&nbsp;aim of the spinner is to regulate the supply of fibres from&nbsp;his bundle in such a manner as to render the thread equal&nbsp;in size throughout. This he does with his left hand, drawing back the fibres as they enter his right hand in too great&nbsp;number, and pulling forward more when the supply is deficient in quantity. He takes care, too, that many ends of&nbsp;fibres do not come together in the same place, and that they&nbsp;so arrange themselves as that the strength of the thread&nbsp;shall be equal throughout. If the spinner slacken his grasp&nbsp;of the fibres with his fore-finger and thumb, the turn will&nbsp;pass his hand, and the thread will be spoiled ; and it is necessary not only that the thread be firmly grasped by the&nbsp;thumb and fore-finger, but also by the whole hand, that it&nbsp;may be compressed and moulded into a cylindrical form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have hitherto described the operation as performed by one spinner ; but as many spinners may work together&nbsp;as there are whirls in the head. Suppose, then, that all&nbsp;the spinners have set on, as the fastening of their threads&nbsp;to the whirls is termed. They proceed together down the&nbsp;walk, and when they are a few paces below the first rail,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> fig. 2, every man throws his thread on one of the hooks,&nbsp;and so at each rail, until they arrive at the foot. They&nbsp;then join the ends of every pair of yarns, and hang them&nbsp;over the post already mentioned ; and for the convenience&nbsp;of afterwards separating them, the pairs are kept apart in&nbsp;the following manner. A piece of twine is tied by its middle to the first pair, a little in advance of the post ; the second pair </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font0">then put over the post, and the string is tied&nbsp;over them ; and in like manner every pair is tied in. This&nbsp;is called nettling. The spinners now set on at the foot or&nbsp;back-end wheel, and spin up the walk. The fore-end wheelman having unhooked the yarns from the whirls of his&nbsp;wheel, and hung them over the post, and tied them in pairs&nbsp;as at the back-end, proceeds down the walk, collecting the&nbsp;yarns from the hooks of the rails, and laying them in a&nbsp;heap in the large hooks c, c, fig. 2. When the spinners again&nbsp;spin down the walk, these same operations are performed&nbsp;by the back-end wheel-man. When the collected yams&nbsp;number about 400, they are coiled up in a haul, and are&nbsp;ready either for tarring, or laying into white ropes. Previous to the haul being taken up for tarring, there is a&nbsp;slight turn put into it to keep it from getting entangled in&nbsp;the tar-kettle. In the government rope-works, by the regulations of 1802, the spinners had to produce, from a bundle of hemp weighing 64 lbs., 18 threads of 170 fathoms&nbsp;each ; 400 of such threads constituted a haul, and weighed&nbsp;12 cwt. 2 qrs, and when tarred 15 cwt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3dly, Ι'arring.—</span><span class="font0">The next operation is that of tarring. This is variously performed. Here we shall describe the&nbsp;simplest method of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The apparatus used in tarring consists of a copper bedded in brickwork with a proper furnace below, and flues around&nbsp;it. The copper is termed the tar-kettle, and at one side of&nbsp;it is erected a strong frame, in which a capstan works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 4 shows this arrangement. Here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> is the kettle ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> the frame ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cc</span><span class="font0"> the capstan, which may be turned either by manual labour, or horse or other power; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dd</span><span class="font0">a truck, on which the&nbsp;haul is being coiled away as it comes from the capstan ; and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee.</span><span class="font0"> small rollers by which the haul is supported. In the upright nearest the boiler is fixed the nipper for squeezing the&nbsp;superfluous tar out of the haul. The nipper is drawn to a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">larger size in fig. 5. Here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aα</span><span class="font0"> is a copper-plate with a hole in it about two and a half inches diameter ; above it another plate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">slides, and out of its lower edge a&nbsp;semicircular piece is cut, corresponding to the hole in the lower&nbsp;plate, so that by sliding this plate&nbsp;down, the aperture is diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A lever </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dd</span><span class="font0"> of the second order is fixed at one end to the chain c,&nbsp;and presses on a stud fixed on the&nbsp;upper plate, so that by moving the&nbsp;weight on the lever the yarn may be pressed to the degree&nbsp;necessary as it passes through the aperture ; and as die tar&nbsp;oozes out of the yarn, it is received and carried bacKfy&gt; the&nbsp;kettle by the spout</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0"> fig. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tar having been put into the kettle and heated to the proper degree, which is about the temperature of boiling water, and is known to the workman, in the absence of&nbsp;more correct means, by a scum closing over its surface, the</span></p>
