The provocation, however, which he received was great ; and Mr Ram-fay, though an amiable, virtuous, and pious man, had a warmth of temper, which, though not deſerving of praiſe, will be cenſuredby none who reflect on the frailties of our common nature. That the particular calumnies propagated againſt him on this occaſion were wholly gronndleſs, it is impoffible to doubt, if we admit him to have been poſſeſſed of common underſtanding. when ſome years ago a ſtory was circulated, of Swift’s ha-ving, when prebendary of Kilroot, been convicted before a magiſtrate of an attempt to commit a rape on the body of one of his pariſhioners, it was thought a ſufficient confutation of the calumny to put the retail-er of it in mind, that the dean of St Patrick’s, though deteſted by the moſt powerful faction in the kingdom, lampooned without dread, and with great ſeverity, the dean of Ferns for the very crime of which, had thi3 anecdote been true, he muſt have been conſcious that all Ireland knew himſelf to be guilty ! Such conduct cannot be reconciled to common ſenſe. Had Swift been a raviſher, though he might have been penitent, and reaſoned in general terms againſt giving way to ſuch licentious paſſions, he would never have ſatyriſed a <hi rend="italic">particular perſon</hi>  for the crime of which he himſelf ſtood convicted. In like manner, had Mr Ramſay been a tyrant to his own ſlaves, though he might have ar-gued againſt ſlavery in the abſtract, on the broad baſis of virtue and religion, he never could have arraigned for ſimilar cruelty a number of individuals in the very iſland which wſtneſſed his own enormities.</p><p>But the melancholy part of the narrative is behind. The agitation given to his mind by theſe calumnies, and the fatigues he underwent in his endeavours to re-ſcqe from mifery the moſt helpleſs portion of the human race, contributed to ſhorten a iife in no common degree uſeful. He had been for ſome time afflicted with a pain in his ſtomach, for which he was prevailed upon, tho’ with great reluctance, to try the effects of air and exerciſe, by attempting a journey of 100 miles. But in London, being ſeized with a violent vomiting of blood, he was unable either to proceed or to be removed home ; and in the houſe of Sir Charles Middleton he ended his days, on the 20th of July 1789, amidſt the groans of his family, and the tears of many friends.— Thus died a man, of whom it is not too much to fay, that " the bleſſing of many that were ready to periſh came upon him for whatever be the fate of the ſlave-trade (ſee Slavery), it is certain that his writings have contributed much to meliorate the treatment of ſlaves- He left behind him a widow and three daughters : and his works, beſides thoſe to which we have al-luded, conſiſt of a volume of <hi rend="italic">Seaſermons,</hi>  preached on board his majeſty’s ſhip the Prince of wales, which ſhow him to have been a maſter of true pulpit-eloquence ; and a <hi rend="italic">Treatſe on Signals,</hi>  which was certainly written, and we think printed, though we know not whether it was ever publiſhed.</p><p>RAMSDEN’s <hi rend="smallcaps">Machine </hi><hi rend="italic">ſor Dividing </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mathema-</hi>TiCAL <hi rend="smallcaps">Instruments,</hi>  is a late invention, by which theſe diviſions can be performed with exceeding great accuracy, ſuch as would formerly have been deemed in</p><p>credible. On difcoveι⅛g the method of conſtruct'ng this machine, its inventor, Mr Ramſdsn of Piccadilly, received 615 1. from the commiſſioners of longitude ; engaging himſelf to inſtruct a certain number of perſons, not exceeding ten, in the method of making and uſing this machine from the 28th october <hi rend="italic">1775</hi>  to 28th october 1777 : alſo binding himſelf to divide all octants and fextants by the fame engine, at the rate of three ſhillings for each octant, and ſix ſhillings for each braſs ſextant, with Nonius’s diviſions to half minutes, for as long time as the commiffioners ſhould think proper to let the engine remain in his poffeffion» Οί this fum of 615 1. paid to Mr Ramſden, 3001. was given him as a reward for the improvement made by him in diſcovering the engine, and the remaining 315l. for his giving up the property of it to the commiſ-ſioners. The following deſcription of the engine, is that given upon oath by Mr Ramſden himſelf.</p><p>" This engine conſiſts of a large wheel of bell-metaI, ſupported on a mahogany ſtand, having three legs, which are ſtrongly connected together by braces, ſo as to make it perfectly ſteady. Οη each leg of the ſtand is placed a conical friction-pulley, whereon the dividing-wheel reſts : to prevent the wheel from Aiding off the friction-pulleys, the bell-metal centre under it turns in a ſocket on the top of the ſtand.</p><p>" The circumference of the wheel is ratched or cut (by a method which will be deſcribed hereafter) into 2160 teeth, in which an endleſs ſcrew acts. Six revolutions of the ſcrew will move the wheel a ſpace equal to one degree.</p><p>" Now a circle of braſs being fixed on the ſcrew ar-bor, having its circumference divided into 60 parts, each diviſion will conſequently anſwer to a motion of the wheel of 10 ſeconds, ſix of them will be equal to a minute, &amp;c.</p><p>" Several different arbors of tempered ſteel are truly ground into the ſocket in the centre of the wheel. The upper parts of the arbors that ſtand above the plane are turned of various ſizes, to ſuſt the centres of different pieces of work to be divided.</p><p>" when any inſtrument is to be divided, the centre of it is very exactly fitted on one of theſe arbors ; and the inſtrument is fixed down to the plane of the dividing wheel, by means of ſcrews, which fit into holes made in the radii of the wheel for that purpoſe.</p><p>“ The inſtrument being thus fitted on the plane of the wheel, the frame which carries the dividing-point is connected at one end by finger-ſcrews with the frame which carries the endlefs ſcrew ; while the other end embraces that part of the ſteel arbor, which ſtands above the inſtrument to be divided, by an angular notch in a piece of hardened ſteel ; by this means both ends of the frame are kept perfectly ſteady and free from any ſhake.</p><p>" The frame carrying the dividing-point or tracer, is made to ſlide on the frame which carries the endlefs ſcrew to any diſtance from the centre of the wheel as the radius of the inſtrument to be divided may require, and may be there faſtened by tightening two clamps ; and the dividing-point or tracer being connected with the clamps by the double-jointed frame, admits a free and eafy motion towards or from the centre for cutting the diviſions, without any lateral ſhake.</p><p>" From what has been ſaid, it appears, that an in-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
