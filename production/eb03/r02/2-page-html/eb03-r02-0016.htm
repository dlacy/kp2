<p><span class="font0">RICINUS, or palμα Christi, in botany: A genus of the monodelphia order, belonging to the mo-noecia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 38th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tricoccœ.</span><span class="font0"> The male calyx is quinquepartite; there is no corolla; the ſtamina numerous. The female calyx is tripartite; there is no&nbsp;corolla, but three bifid ſtyles, with a trilocular capſule,&nbsp;and a ſingle ſeed. There are three ſpecies, of which&nbsp;the moſt remarkable is the communis, or common&nbsp;palma Chriſti. This tree is of ſpeedy growth, as in one&nbsp;year it arrives at its full height, which ſeldom exceeds&nbsp;20 feet. The trunk is ſubligneous; the pith is large;&nbsp;the leaves broad and palmated; the flower ſpike is ſimple, and thickly ſet with yellow bloſſoms in the ſhape of&nbsp;a cone; the capſules are triangular and prickly, containing three ſmooth gray mottled ſeeds. When the&nbsp;bunches begin to turn black, they are gathered, dried&nbsp;in the ſun, and the ſeeds picked out. They are afterwards put up for uſe as wanted, or for exportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caſtor oil is obtained either by expreſſion or by decoction. The firſt method is practiſed in England; the latter in Jamaica. It is common firſt to parch the nuts&nbsp;or feeds in an iron pot over the fire; but this gives the&nbsp;oil an empyreumatic taſte, ſmell, and colour; and it is&nbsp;beſt prepared in this manner: A large iron pot or boiler&nbsp;is firſt prepared, and half filled with water. The nuts&nbsp;are then beaten in parcels in deep wooden mortars, and&nbsp;after a quantity is beaten it is thrown into the iron veſ-ſel. The fire is then lighted, and the liquor is gently&nbsp;boiled for two hours, and kept conſtantly ſtirred. About&nbsp;this time the oil begins to ſeparate, and ſwims on the&nbsp;top, mixed with a white froth, and is ſkimmed off till&nbsp;no more riſes. The ſkimmings are heated in a ſmall&nbsp;iron pot, and ſtrained through a cloth. When cold, it&nbsp;is put up in jars or bottles for uſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caſtor oil, thus made, is clear and well flavoured, and if put into proper bottles will keep ſweet for years.&nbsp;The expreſſed caſtor oil ſoon turns rancid, becauſe the&nbsp;mucilaginous and acrid parts of the nut are ſqueezed&nbsp;out with the oil. On this account the preference is given&nbsp;to well prepared oil by decoction. An Engliſh gallon&nbsp;of the ſeeds yield about two pounds of oil, which is a&nbsp;great proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before the diſturbances in America, the planters imported train oil ſor lamps and other purpoſes about ſu-gar works. It is now found that the caſtor oil can be procured as cheap as the fiſh oil of America: it burns&nbsp;clearer, and has not any offenſive ſmell. This- oil, too,&nbsp;is fit for all the purpoſes of the painter, or for the apothecary in ointments and plaſters. As a medicine, it&nbsp;purges without ſtimulus, and is ſo mild as to be given&nbsp;to infants ſoon after birth, to purge off the meconium.&nbsp;All oils are noxious to infects, but the caſtor oil kills&nbsp;and expels them. It is generally given as a purge after&nbsp;uſing the cabbage bark ſome days. In conſtipation and&nbsp;belly-ach this oil is uſed with remarkable ſucceſs. It&nbsp;ſits well on the ſtomach, allays the ſpaſm, and brings&nbsp;about a plentiful evacuation by ſtool, eſpecially if at the&nbsp;ſame time fomentations, or the warm bath, are uſed. —&nbsp;Belly-ach is at preſent leſs frequent in Jamaica than formerly, owing to ſeveral cauſes. The inhabitants, in&nbsp;general, live better, and drink</span><span class="font1"> better liquors; </span><span class="font0">but the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">exceſſive drinking of new rum ſtill makes it frequent amongſt ſoldiers, ſailors, and the lower order of white&nbsp;people. It has been known to happen too from viſceral obſtructions after intermittents, or marſh fevers, in Jamaica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ricinus Americanus grows as tall as a little tree, and is ſo beautiful that Millar ſays it deſerves a&nbsp;place in every curious garden, and he planted it himſelf&nbsp;at Chelſea. It expands into many branches; the leaves&nbsp;are ſometimes two feet in diameter; and the ſtem as&nbsp;large as a middle-ſized broom ſtaff; towards the top of&nbsp;the branch it has a cluſter of flowers, ſomething reſem-bling a bunch of grapes; the flowers are ſmall and ſta-minous, but on the body of the plant grow bunches of&nbsp;rough triangular huſks, each containing three ſpeckled&nbsp;ſeeds, generally ſomewhat leſs than horſe beans; the&nbsp;ſhell is brittle, and contains white kernels of a ſweet,&nbsp;oily, and nauſeous taſte. From this kernel the oil is&nbsp;extracted, and if the medicine ſhould become officinal,&nbsp;the ſeeds may be imported at a reaſonable rate, as the&nbsp;plant grows wild and in great plenty in all the Britiſh and&nbsp;French American iſlands. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Oleum Palm</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">æ</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"> Chriſti.</span><span class="font0"> Of&nbsp;the ricinus communis there are a great many varieties; all&nbsp;of them fine majeſtic plants, annual, or at moſt biennial,&nbsp;in this country; but in their native ſoil they are ſaid to&nbsp;be perennial both in root and ſtem. They are propagated by ſeeds ſown on a hotſhed, and require the&nbsp;ſame treatment as other tender exotics-.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICOCHET, in gunnery, is when guns, howitzers, or mortars, are loaded with ſmall charges, and elevated from 5 to 12 degrees, ſo as to fire over the&nbsp;parapet, and the ſhot or ſhell rolls along the oppoſite&nbsp;rampart: it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ricochet-ſiring,</span><span class="font0"> and the batteries&nbsp;are likewiſe called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ricochet-batteries.</span><span class="font0"> This method </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">firing was firſt invented by M. Belidor, and firſt uſed at&nbsp;the ſiege of Ath in 1697. This mode of firing out of&nbsp;mortars was firſt tried in 1723 at the military ſchool at&nbsp;Straſhourg, and with ſucceſs. At the battle of Roſ-bach, in 1757, the king of Pruſſia had ſeveral 6-inch&nbsp;mortars made with trunnions, and mounted on travelling -carriages, which fired obliquely on the enemy's lines, and amongſt their horſe, loaded with 8 ounces of&nbsp;powder, and at an elevation of one degree 15 minutes, which did great execution; for the ſhells rolling along&nbsp;the lines, with burning fuzes, made the ſtouteſt of the&nbsp;enemy not wait for their burſting.</span></p>
