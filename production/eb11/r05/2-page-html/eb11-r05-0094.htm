<p><span class="font2">poetry for inspiration. He collected Rumanian popular songs and ballads </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Doine,</span><span class="font2"> 1844) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(L&amp;cr&amp;mioare,</span><span class="font2"> 1853)- In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pasteluri&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1867) he introduced admirable picturesof popular life into&nbsp;Rumanian poetry. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Legende</span><span class="font2"> (1871) and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">no$trii</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1877) he strikes the patriotic note. His fame rests on his lyrical poetry alone, which retains some of the charm of popular poetry.&nbsp;Alecsandri is less successful in his dramas, most of which are adaptations from French originals; the only merit of his novels is that&nbsp;amidst the phonetic and philological turmoil he kept to the purer&nbsp;language of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From Alecsandri there is </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">natural transition to his great rival, who was also his superior in depth of thought and in mastery of&nbsp;form and language, the great poet of pessimism, Mihail&nbsp;Eminescu (&lt;?.r.). Mention may also be made of Matilde</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cugler Poni (b. 1853), who published some admirable short poems in the Rumanian reviews </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Poesii,</span><span class="font2"> 1888). Veronica Miele (1853-1889)&nbsp;belongs to the same circle of gifted Moldavian women </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Poesii,</span><span class="font2"> 1887).&nbsp;But all these men or women disappear with the appearance of&nbsp;Eminescu, who, like Bolintineanu, started a new school of poetry&nbsp;and left a deep and growing influence .upon, the new generation.&nbsp;His best follower, though possessing originality of his own, is A.&nbsp;Vlahu^á (b. 1859). G. Co§buc, who has risen more recently to fame,&nbsp;is the poet of the unfortunate Rumanian peasant, emancipated&nbsp;only in name and on paper, and a prey to greedy landowners and to&nbsp;a medieval administration. The poets of this school drew their&nbsp;inspiration from popular poetry, and all of them were sons of the&nbsp;lower middle class or of peasants, who by dint of heavy work and&nbsp;great hardship were able to rise above the narrow social conditions&nbsp;in which they were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Somewhat different has been the development of the Rumanian prose writers. They suffered in consequence of the philological&nbsp;confusion brought about by Eliade and his assistants,&nbsp;mostly men who after 1848 immigrated from Transylvania&nbsp;and brought with them their own prejudices and narrow&nbsp;intolerance. Too great influence was accorded to them, and the&nbsp;result was that for a long time scarcely a single Rumanian novelist&nbsp;or historian can be mentioned. It was only after N. Bálcescu had&nbsp;undertaken the edition of the ancient Walachian chronicles, and had&nbsp;found in them admirable prose writers., that he ventured on a continuous history (1851-52) of the Rumanians under Michael the Brave,&nbsp;written not as a didactic treatise but as a poem in prose—full of colour&nbsp;and of energy. A. Odobescu, the friend and literary executor of&nbsp;Bálcescu, was a consummate scholar of ancient and medieval antiquities, and wrote a history of ancient art. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudkynegelikos</span><span class="font2"> is&nbsp;an unsurpassed model of elegant writing and of fine irony. What&nbsp;Alecsandri was for verse, Odobescu was for prose. He also created&nbsp;the Rumanian historical novel, by his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mihnea Voda</span><span class="font2"> (1858) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Doamna Kiajna</span><span class="font2"> (i860). The first novel describing human nature in&nbsp;everyday life is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ciocoii vechi fi noi</span><span class="font2"> (1863) of Nicolae Filimon&nbsp;(1819-1865). In Moldavia where the knowledge of the old chroniclers&nbsp;had not entirely died out and disturbing philological influences&nbsp;were not so acutely felt, we find the vigorous writings of Mihail&nbsp;Cogálniceanu—one of the leading spirits of the 19th century, the&nbsp;greatest mind and the real founder of Rumania. Cogálniceanu&nbsp;published various reviews, some of a political, others of a more&nbsp;literary character, such as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dacia literarti,</span><span class="font2"> (1840) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archiva&nbsp;romdneasca</span><span class="font2"> (1845-46); he has also the great merit of having published&nbsp;for the first time a collection of the Moldavian chronicles. G. Asaki&nbsp;(1788-1871), a second Eliade, helped to inaugurate a literary reform,&nbsp;in Moldavia; but the result was disappointing, until the literary&nbsp;society known as the Junimea was started, in the ’seventies, by&nbsp;Titu Maiorescu (b. 1839), who was then a professor at Jassy. Titu&nbsp;Maiorescu put a stop to the prevailing Latinism, and turned the&nbsp;current of Rumanian literature into a more healthy channel, by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the publication of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Critice</span><span class="font2"> (1874).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ioan Ghica, a contemporary of the revolutionaries of 1848, gathered his recollections of those agitated times into two volumes,&nbsp;dmtft/zrt (1890) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scrisori catre V. Alecsandri</span><span class="font2"> (1887), which&nbsp;besides their historical value have become a model of Rumanian&nbsp;prose. Among writers of fiction three names stand out prominently:&nbsp;Ion Slavici (b. 1848) describes the life of the people, notably </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the&nbsp;Transylvanian peasants, in short stories, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nuvele din popor.</span><span class="font2"> Barbu&nbsp;Stefánescu de la Vrancea (b. 1858) also wrote short popular stories&nbsp;characterized by a wealth of imagery and richness of language;&nbsp;but the characters are all mostly unreal and exaggerated. The best&nbsp;known collections are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sultánica</span><span class="font2"> (1885) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trubadurul</span><span class="font2"> (1887).&nbsp;Ioan Caragiali (b. 1852), the most popular Rumanian dramatist&nbsp;of modern times, who has brought on the stage living types of the&nbsp;lower and middle classes, and has skilfully portrayed the effect of&nbsp;modern veneer on old customs, is also the author of the powerful&nbsp;short novel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Faclia de paste.</span><span class="font2"> Dobrogeanu Gherea (b. 1853) has in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studii critice</span><span class="font2"> (1890 sqq.) been a ruthless but none the less judicious&nbsp;critic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Curiously enough, there is not a single novel in the Rumanian literature with a sustained plot; none which presents a study of the&nbsp;development of human character amid the multifarious vicissitudes&nbsp;of life. The reason for this deficiency is perhaps the unsettled&nbsp;conditions of Rumanian life, and the lack of a profound and long-established civilization; or it may be found in the unstable and&nbsp;fickle character of the people. Whatever the cause may be, while&nbsp;Rumanian poetry could well compare with that of any Western&nbsp;nation, in the domain of prose writing, and of novels in particular, one&nbsp;must look to the future to fill up the gap now existing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There existed in Rumania another set of literary monuments at least as old as any of the books hitherto enumerated,&nbsp;but which appealed to a wider circle. Rumanian&nbsp;folk-literature contains both popular written books&nbsp;and oral songs, ballads, &amp;c. It is advisable to group&nbsp;the material in three sections: (1) the romantic and&nbsp;secular literature; (2) the religious literature;—both&nbsp;of these being written—and (3) the modern collections of&nbsp;ballads, songs, tales, </span><span class="font0">&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the first belong the oldest books, such as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Alexander the Great,</span><span class="font2"> which was known in Rumania in the 17th century. It rests mostly upon a Sloveno-Greek text and is of the utmost&nbsp;interest for the study of this cycle of legends. The first printed&nbsp;copy appeared in 1794, and has been reprinted in innumerable&nbsp;editions. Next comes the legend of Constantine, of his town and&nbsp;his exploits—a remarkable collection of purely Byzantine legends.&nbsp;In addition to these there is the histoiy of St Sylvester and the&nbsp;conversion of Constantine, &amp;c., all still in MS. TAe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Barlaam and Ioasaf</span><span class="font2"> (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barlaam and Jos a ph at)</span><span class="font2"> may also be&nbsp;mentioned here, for it appealed to the people not so much for&nbsp;its religious interest as for the romantic career of the. hero. The&nbsp;parables and apologues contained in the legend were incorporated&nbsp;into the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Teachings of Prince Neagoe,</span><span class="font2"> and were also circulated separately; they are found in many old MSS.. Udri§te (Uriil) N&amp;sturel&nbsp;translated the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History</span><span class="font2"> from the Slavonic in .1640. One of its&nbsp;episodes, the farewell song of the prince departing into the forest,&nbsp;has since become one of the most widespread popular songs. Of&nbsp;similar oriental origin is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dream of Mamer,</span><span class="font2"> the interpretation&nbsp;of which goes back to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Panchatantra,</span><span class="font2"> and must have reached&nbsp;Rumania early in the 18th century, probably in Slavonic. The&nbsp;history of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Syntippa and the Seven Masters</span><span class="font2"> has also become a popular&nbsp;book. It was translated from the Greek version. To the same&nbsp;cycle of oriental tales belongs the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Halima,</span><span class="font2"> already described,&nbsp;which G. Gorjeanu printed (3 vols., 1835-37) as his own work.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Arkir and Anadam,</span><span class="font2"> printed by Anton Pann from&nbsp;older. MSS., is the now famous Old Testament apocryphon of&nbsp;Akyrios the Wise, mentioned in Tobit and found in many languages.&nbsp;In Rumanian it rests on an older Greek-Slavonic text, and owes&nbsp;its great popularity to the wise and witty proverbs it contains.&nbsp;“ Esop,” whose wonderful biography (by Planudes) agrees in&nbsp;many points with Arkir, has also become one of the Rumanian&nbsp;popular books. The history of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bertoldo,</span><span class="font2"> which, though of Italian&nbsp;origin, reached Rumania. through a Greek translation, belongs&nbsp;to the same cycle of rustic wisdom and cunning, and is the last&nbsp;representative of an old series of legends clustering round the&nbsp;figures of Solomon and Ashmodai, or Solomon and Markolph.&nbsp;These books are of course anonymous, most of them being translations and adaptations. One man, however, stands out prominently in this section of romantic and secular folk-literature.&nbsp;This was Anton Pann, who was bom in 1797 at Slivden, of Bulgarian parentage, and died at Bucharest in 1.854. Carried away&nbsp;by the Russians in his early youth, he settled in Rumania, learned&nbsp;Church music, and became one of its best exponents, married four&nbsp;times, had an adventurous life, but lived among the people for&nbsp;whom he wrote and composed his tunes. In about twenty years&nbsp;he published no. less than fifty books, all of them still popular.&nbsp;Besides his edition of the Rumanian Church service-books with&nbsp;musical notation, he published a series of tales, proverbs and songs&nbsp;either from older texts or from oral information; and he made&nbsp;the first collection of popular songs, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spitalul amorului,</span><span class="font2"> “ The&nbsp;Hospital of Love ” (1850-53), with tunes either composed by himself&nbsp;or obtained from the gipsy musicians who alone performed them.&nbsp;Of his numerous writings two or three are of the greatest interest&nbsp;to folklore. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Povestea vorbii</span><span class="font2"> (first ed. 1 vol., 1847; 2nd ed.&nbsp;3 vols., 1851-53) is a large collection of proverbs ingeniously connected with one another and leading up to or starting from a&nbsp;popular tale exemplifying the proverb. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fabule $i istorioare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(2 vols., 1839-41) is a collection of short popular stories in rhyme;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sez$toarea la tard</span><span class="font2"> (1852-53) is a description of the Rumanian&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spinnstube,</span><span class="font2"> for which the peasants gather in. one of their houses&nbsp;on a winter’s night, the girls and women spinning and working,&nbsp;the young men telling tales, proverbs, riddles, singing songs, &amp;c.&nbsp;Pann also collected the^ jokes of the Turkish jester, Nasreddin,&nbsp;under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ndsdrdvdniile lui Nastratin Hogea</span><span class="font2"> (1853), also in&nbsp;rhyme.. He also published a collection of Christmas carols, set&nbsp;to music by himself; these arc still sung by boys on Christmas&nbsp;night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Far larger than the secular is the religious popular literature; it comprises many apocryphal tales from the Old and the New Testaments, and not a few of the heretical tales circulated by the various&nbsp;sects of Asia Minor and Thracia, which percolated into. Rumania&nbsp;through the medium of Slavonic. A brief enumeration of the</span></p>
