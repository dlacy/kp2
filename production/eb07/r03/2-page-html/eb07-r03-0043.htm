<p><span class="font0">only four thousand men, that composed the wing which he commanded, pursued the flying enemy, amounting to fifty&nbsp;thousand, to the river Narva. Here the bridge broke&nbsp;down with the weight of the fugitives, and the river was&nbsp;filled with their bodies. Great numbers returned in despair to their camp, where they defended themselves for a&nbsp;short time, but were at last obliged to surrender. In this&nbsp;battle, thirty thousand were killed in the intrenchments&nbsp;and the pursuit, or drowned in the river ; twenty thousand&nbsp;surrendered at discretion, and were dismissed unarmed,&nbsp;while the rest were totally dispersed. Λ hundred and&nbsp;fifty pieces of cannon, twenty-eight mortars, a hundred&nbsp;and fifty-one pairs of colours, twenty standards, and all&nbsp;the Russian baggage, fell into the hands of the Swedes ;&nbsp;and the Duke de Croy, the Prince of Georgia, and seven&nbsp;otller generals, were made prisoners. Charles behaved with&nbsp;the greatest generosity to the conquered. Being informed that the tradesmen of Narva had refused credit to the&nbsp;officers whom he detained prisoners, he sent a thousand&nbsp;ducats to the Duke de Croy, and to every other officer a&nbsp;proportional sum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter was advancing with forty thousand men to surround the Swedes, when he received intelligence of the dreadful&nbsp;defeat at Narva. He was greatly chagrined ; but comforting&nbsp;himself with the hopes that the Swedes would in time teach&nbsp;the Russians to beat them, he returned to his own dominions, where he applied himself with the utmost diligence&nbsp;to the raising of another army. He evacuated all the provinces which he had invaded, and for a time abandoned all&nbsp;his great projects, thus leaving Charles at liberty to prosecute the war against Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Augustus had expected an attack, he endeavoured to draw the czar into a close alliance with him. The two monarchs had an interview at Birzen, where it was agreed that&nbsp;Augustus should lend the czar fifty thousand German soldiers, to be paid by Russia ; that the czar should send an&nbsp;equal number of his troops to be trained up to the art of&nbsp;war in Poland ; and that he should pay the king three millions of rix-dollars in the space of two years. Of this&nbsp;treaty Charles had notice, and, by means of his minister&nbsp;Count Piper, entirely frustrated the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the battle of Narva, Charles became confident and negligent, while the activity of Peter increased with his&nbsp;losses. He supplied his want of artillery by melting down&nbsp;the bells of the churches, and constructed numerous small&nbsp;vessels on the lake of Ladoga to oppose the entrance of the&nbsp;Swedes into his dominions. He took every advantage of&nbsp;Charles’s negligence, and engaged in frequent skirmishes,&nbsp;in which, though often beaten, he was sometimes victorious.&nbsp;He contrived to make himself master of the river Neva,&nbsp;and captured Nyenschantz<sub>1</sub> a fortress at the mouth of that&nbsp;river. Here he laid the foundation of that city which he&nbsp;had long projected, and which was to become the metropolis of his empire. At length, in 1704∙, he became master&nbsp;of Ingria, and appointed his favourite Prince Menzikoff to&nbsp;be viceroy of that province, with strict orders to make the&nbsp;building of the new city his principal business. Here edifices were already rising in every quarter, and navigation&nbsp;and commerce were increasing in vigour and extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time Augustus king of Poland, though treat-• ing with Charles for the surrender of his dominions, was obliged to keep up the appearance of war, which he had&nbsp;neither ability nor inclination to conduct. He had been&nbsp;lately joined by Prince Menzikoff with thirty thousand Russians ; and this obliged him, contrary to his inclination, to&nbsp;hazard an engagement with Meyerfeldt, who commanded&nbsp;ten thousand men, one half of whom were Swedes. As at&nbsp;tnis time no disparity of numbers whatever was reckoned an&nbsp;equivalent to the valour of the Swedes, Meyerfeldt did not&nbsp;decline the combat, though the army of the enemy was four&nbsp;times as numerous as his own. With his own countrymen he&nbsp;defeated the enemy’s first line, and was on the point of defeating the second, when Stanislas, with the Poles and Lithuanians, gave way. Meyerfeldt then perceived that the battle&nbsp;was lost ; but he fought desperately, that he might avoid&nbsp;the disgrace of a defeat. At last, however, he was oppressed&nbsp;by numbers, and forced to surrender ; suffering the Swedes&nbsp;for the first time to be conquered by their enemies. The&nbsp;whole army were taken prisoners excepting Major-general&nbsp;Krassau, who having repeatedly rallied a body of horse&nbsp;formed into a brigade, at last broke through the enemy, and&nbsp;escaped to Posnania. Augustus had scarcely sung </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Te Deum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for this victory, when his plenipotentiary returned from&nbsp;Saxony with the articles of the treaty, by which he was to&nbsp;renounce all claim to the crown of Poland in favour of his&nbsp;rival Stanislas. The king hesitated and scrupled, but at&nbsp;last signed them ; after which he set out for Saxony, glad&nbsp;at any expense to be freed from such an enemy as the king&nbsp;of Sweden, and from such allies as the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The czar Peter was no sooner informed of this extraordinary treaty, than he learned also the cruel fate of his plenipotentiary Patkul, a Livonian emigrant, whom Charles&nbsp;claiming as a subject, seized and executed. Peter immediately sent letters to every court in Christendom, complaining of this breach of the law of nations. He entreated&nbsp;the emperor, the queen of Britain, and the states-general,&nbsp;to revenge this insult on humanity. He stigmatized the&nbsp;compliance of Augustus with the opprobrious name of pusillanimity ; and exhorted them not to guarantee a treaty so&nbsp;unjust, but to despise the menaces of the Swedish bully. So&nbsp;well, however, was the prowess of the king of Sweden known,&nbsp;that none of the allies thought proper to irritate him, by refusing to guarantee any treaty which he thought proper to&nbsp;accept. At first, Peter thought of revenging PatkuPs death&nbsp;by massacring the Swedish prisoners at Moscow ; but from&nbsp;this he was deterred, by remembering that Charles had many&nbsp;more Russian prisoners than he himself had of Swedes. In&nbsp;the year 1707, however, he entered Poland at the head of&nbsp;sixty thousand men, and, assembling a diet, solemnly deposed Stanislas, with the same ceremonies which had been&nbsp;used with regard to Augustus. The appearance of a Swedish army under King Stanislas and General Lewenhaupt&nbsp;put a stop to this invasion, and the czar retired into Lithuania, giving out as the cause of his retreat, that the country&nbsp;could not supply him with the provisions and forage necessary for so great an army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During these transactions Charles had taken up his residence in Saxony, where he gave laws to the court of Vienna, and in a manner intimidated all Europe. At last, satiated&nbsp;with the glory of having dethroned one king, set up another,&nbsp;and struck all Europe with terror and admiration, he began&nbsp;to evacuate Saxony in pursuit of his great plan, the dethroning the czar Peter, and conquering the vast empire of Russia.&nbsp;While the army was on full march in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Dresden, he took the extraordinary resolution of visiting&nbsp;King Augustus with no more than five attendants. Although&nbsp;he had no reason to imagine that Augustus either did or&nbsp;could entertain any friendship for him, he was not uneasy&nbsp;at the consequences of thus putting himself entirely in his&nbsp;power. He reached the palace door of Augustus before it&nbsp;was known that he was in the city ; and he entered the&nbsp;elector’s chamber in his boots before the latter had time to&nbsp;recover from his surprise. He breakfasted with him in a&nbsp;friendly manner, and then expressed a desire of viewing&nbsp;the fortifications. While he was walking round them, a Livonian, who had formerly been condemned in Sweden, and&nbsp;served in the troops of Saxony, thought he could never have&nbsp;a more favourable opportunity of obtaining pardon. He&nbsp;therefore begged of King Augustus to intercede for him,&nbsp;being fully assured that his majesty could not refuse so&nbsp;small a favour to a prince in whose power he then was.&nbsp;Augustus accordingly made the request, but Charles refused</span></p>
