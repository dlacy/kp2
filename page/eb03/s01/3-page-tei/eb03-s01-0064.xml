            <p>been tranſlated into the Greek language, and made generally known; and there is
                nothing in the work itſelf, or at leaſt in thoſe parts of it which he has preſerved,
                that could induce a wife and good man to obtrude it upon the public as genuine, had
                he himſelf ſuſpected it to be ſpurious. Too many of the Chriſtian fathers were
                indeed very credulous, and ready to admit the authenticity of writings without duly
                weighing the merits of their claim; but then ſuch writings were always believed to
                be favourable to the Chriſtian cauſe, and inimical to the cauſe of Paganiſm. That no
                man of common ſenſe could ſuppoſe the coſmogony of Sanchoniatho favourable to the
                cauſe of revealed religion, a farther proof cannot be requiſite than what is
                furniſhed by the following extract.</p>
            <p>“He ſuppoſeth, or affirms, that the principles of the univerſe was a dark and windy
                air, or a wind made of dark air, and a turbulent evening <hi rend="italic"
                    >chaos;</hi> and that theſe things were boundleſs, and for a long time had no
                bound or figure. But when this wind fell in love with his own principles, and a
                mixture was made, that mixture was called <hi rend="italic">deſire</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cupid (ποϐος).</hi></p>
            <p>“This mixture completed, was the beginning of the (χτισεως) making of all things. But
                that wind did not know its own production; and of this, with that wind, was begotten
                    <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi> which ſome call <hi rend="italic">Mud,</hi> others
                the putrefaction of a watery mixture. And of this came all the ſeed of this
                building, and the generation of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>“But there were certain animals, which had no ſenſe, out of which were begotten
                intelligent animals, and were called <hi rend="italic">Zopheſemin,</hi> that is, the
                ſpies or overſeers of Heaven; and were formed alike in the ſhape of an egg. Thus
                ſhone out <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi> the fun and the moon, the leſs and the greater
                ſtars.</p>
            <p>“And the air ſhining thoroughly with light, by its fiery influence on the ſea and
                earth, winds were begotten, and clouds and great defluxions of the heavenly waters.
                And when all theſe things firſt were parted, and were ſeparated from their proper
                place by the heat of the ſun, and then all met again in the air, and daſhed againſt
                one another, and were ſo broken to pieces; whence thunders and lightenings were
                made: and at the ſtroke of theſe thunders the fore-mentioned intelligent animals
                were awakened, and frighted with the found; and male and female ſtirred in the earth
                and in the ſea: This is their generation of animals.</p>
            <p>“After theſe things our author (Sanchoniatho) goes on ſaying: Theſe things are
                written in the <hi rend="italic">Coſmogony</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Taautus,</hi>
                and in his memoirs; and out of the conjectures, and ſurer natural ſigns which his
                mind ſaw, and found out, and wherewith he hath enlightened us.</p>
            <p>“Afterwards declaring the names of the winds, <hi rend="italic">north and ſouth</hi>
                and the reft, he makes this epilogue. 'But theſe firſt men conſecrated the plants
                ſhooting out of the earth, and judged them gods, and worſhipped them; upon whom they
                themſelves lived, and all their poſterity and all before them: to theſe they made
                their meat and drink offerings. ’ Then he concludes: "theſe were the devices of
                worſhip agreeing with the weakneſs and want of boldneſs in their minds.”</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe Euſebius to have been as weak and credulous as the darkeſt monk in the
                darkeſt age of Europe, a ſuppoſition which no man will make who knows any thing of
                the writings of that eminent hiſto</p>
            <p>rian; what could he fee in this ſenſeleſs jargon, which even a dreaming monk would
                think of employing in ſupport of Chriſtianity? Euſebius calls it, and calls it
                truly, direct atheiſm; but could he imagine that an ancient ſyſtem of atheiſm would
                contribute ſo much to make the Pagans of his age admit as divine revelations the
                books of the Old and New Teſtaments, that he ſhould be induced to adopt, without
                examination, an impudent forgery not 200 years old as genuine remains of the moſt
                remote antiquity?</p>
            <p>If this Phenician coſmogony be a fabrication of Porphyry, or of the pretended
                tranſlator, it muſt ſurely have been fabricated for ſome purpoſe; but it is
                impoſſible for us to conceive what purpoſe either of theſe writers could have
                intended to ſerve by forging a ſyſtem ſo extravagantly abſurd. Porphyry, though an
                enemy to the Chriſtians, was not an atheiſt, and would never have thought of making
                an atheiſt of him whom he meant to obtrude upon the world as the rival of Moſes. His
                own principles were thoſe of the Alexandrian Platoniſts; and had he been the forger
                of the works which bear the name of Sanchoniatho, inſtead of the incomprehenſible
                jargon about <hi rend="italic">dark wind, evening chaos, Mot,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">overſeers oſ heaven in the ſhape oſ an egg,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">animation proceeding from the found oſ thunder,</hi> we ſhould
                doubtleſs have been amuſed with refined ſpeculations concerning the operations of
                the <hi rend="italic">Demiurgus</hi> and the other perſons in the Platonic Triad.
                See <hi rend="smallcaps">Platonism</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Porphyry.</hi></p>
            <p>Father Simon of the oratory imagines @@* that the purpoſe for which the hiſtory of
                Sanchoniatho was forged, was to ſupport Paganiſm, by taking from it its mythology
                and allegories, which were perpetually objected to it by the Chriſtian writers; but
                this learned man totally miſtakes the matter. The primitive Chriſtians were too much
                attached to allegories themſelves to reſt their objections to Paganiſm on ſuch a
                foundation: what they objected to that ſyſtem was the immoral ſtories told of the
                gods. To this the Pagan prieſts and philoſophers replied, that theſe ſtories were
                only <hi rend="italic">mythologic allegories,</hi> which veiled all the great truths
                of Theology, Ethics, and Phyſics. The Chriſtians ſaid, this could not be; for that
                the ſtories of the gods had a ſubſtantial foundation in fact, theſe gods being only
                dead men deified, who, in life, had like paſſions and infirmities with other
                mortals. This then was the objection which the forger of the works of Sanchoniatho
                had to remove, if he really forged them in ſupport of Paganiſm; but, inſtead of
                doing ſo, he gives the genealogy and hiſtory of all the greater gods, and ſhows,
                that they were men deified after death for the exploits, ſome of them groſsly
                immoral, which they had performed in this world. We have elſewhere <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Polytheism,</hi> n⁰ 17.) given his account of the deification
                of <hi rend="italic">Chryſor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ouranos,</hi> and Ge, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Hypſiſtos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Muth;</hi> but our
                readers may not perhaps be ill pleaſed to accompany him through the hiſtory of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ouranos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cronus,</hi> two of his
                greateſt gods; whence it will appear how little his writings are calculated to
                ſupport the tottering cauſe of Paganiſm againſt the objections which were then urged
                to it by the Chriſtian apologiſts.</p>
            <p>“Ouranos (ſays he), taking the kingdom of his father, married Ge his ſiſter, and by
                her had four ſons; <hi rend="italic">Ilus,</hi> who is called <hi rend="italic"
