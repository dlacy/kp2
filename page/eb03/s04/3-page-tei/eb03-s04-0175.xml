Overcome with ſhame and despair at this misfortune, he deſired his followers to ſhift for themſelves, while he himſelf retired to Medina Cœli, and put an end to his life by abſtinence in the year 998.</p><p>Dining this period a new Chriſtian principality appeared in Spain, namely that of Caſtile, which is now divided into the Old and New Caſtile. The Old Caſtile was recovered long before that called the <hi rend="italic">New. </hi>It was ſeparated from the kingdom <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Leon on one side by ſome little rivers ; on the other, it was bounded by the Aſturias, Biſcay, and the province of Rioja. On the ſouth it had the mountains of Segovia and Avila ; thus lying in the middle between the Chriſtian kingdom of Leon and Oviedo, and the Mooriſh kingdom of Cordova. Hence this diſtrict ſoon became an object of contention between the kings of Leon and thoſe of Cordova ; and as the former were generally victorious, ſome of the principal Caſtilian nobility retained their independency under the protection of the Chriſtian kings, even when the power of the Moors was at its greateſt height. In 884 we firſt hear of Don Rodriguez affirming the title of <hi rend="italic">count of Castile,</hi> though it does not appear that either his territory or title were given him by the king of Leon. Neverthelefs, this monarch having taken upon him to puniſh ſome of the Caſtilian lords as rebels, the inhabitants made a formal renunciation of their allegiance, and ſet up a new kind of government. The ſupreme power was now veſted in two perſons of quality ſtyled <hi rend="italic">judges ;</hi> however, this method did not long continue to give satisfaction, and the ſovereignty was once more veſted in a single perſon. By degrees Caſtile fell entirely under the power of the kings of Leon and Oviedo; and, in 1035, Don Sanchez bestowed it on his eldeſt ſon Don Ferdinand, with the title of <hi rend="italic">king;</hi> and thus the territories of Caſtile were firſt firmly united to thoſe of Leon and Oviedo, and the ſovereigns were thenceforth ſtyled <hi rend="italic">kings of Leon and Caſtle.</hi></p><p>Beſides all theſe, another Chriſtian kingdom was ſet up in Spain about the beginning of the 11th century. This was the kingdom of Arragon. The inhabitants were very brave, and lovers of liberty, ſo that it is probable they had in ſome degree maintained their independency, even when the power of the Moors was greateſt. The hiſtory of Arragon, however, during its infancy, is much leſs known than that of any of the others hitherto mentioned. We are only assured, that about the year 1035, Don Sanchez,ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Great,</hi> king of Navarre, erected Arragon into a kingdom in favour of his ſon Don Ramira, and afterwards it became very powerful. At this time, then, we may imagine the continent of Spain divided into two unequal parts hy a ſtraight line drawn from eaſt to west, from the coasts of Valentia to a little below the mouth of the Duro. The country north of this belonged to the Chriſtians, who, as yet, had the ſmalleſt and leaſt valuable ſhare, and all the rest to the Moors. In point of wealth and real power, both by land and ſea, the Moors were greatly ſuperior ; but their continual diſſenſions greatly weakened them, and every day facilitated the progreſs of the Chriſtians. Indeed, had either of the parties been united, the other muſt ſoon have yielded ; for though the Chriſtians did not make war</p><p>upon each other conſtantly as the Moors did, them mutual feuds were yet sufficient to have ruined them, had their adverſaries made the leaſt uſe of the advantages thus afforded them. But among the Moors almoſt every city was a kingdom ; and as theſe petty ſovereignties ſupported one another very indifferently, they fell a prey one after another to their enemies. In 1080, the king of Toledo was engaged in a war with the king of Seville, another Mooriſh potentate ; which being obſerved by Alphonſo king of Caſtile, he alſo invaded his territories ; and in four years made himſelf master of the city of Toledo, with all the places of importance in its neighbourhood ; from thenceforth making Toledo the capital of his dominions. In a ſhort time the whole province of New Caſtile ſubmitted ; aud Madrid, the preſent capital of Spain, fell into the hands of the Chriſtians, being at that time but a ſmall place.</p><p>The Moors were ſo much alarmed at theſe conqueſts, that they not only entered into a general confederacy againſt the Chriſtiasis, but invited to their aſſiſtance Mahomet Ben Joſeph the ſovereign of Barbary. He accordingly came, attended by an incredible multitude ; but was utterly defeated by the Chriſtians in the defiles of the Black Mountain, or Sierra Morena, on the borders of Andaluſta. This victory happened on the 16th of July 1212, and the anniverſary is ſtill celebrated at Toledo. This victory was not improved; the Chriſtian army immediately diſperſed themſelves, while the Moors of Andaluſia were ſtrengthened by the remains of the African army ; yet, inſtead of being taught, by their paſt misfortunes, to unite among themſelves, their dissenſions became worſe than ever, and the conqueſts of the Chriſtians became daily more rapid. In 1230, Don Ferdinand of Caſtile and Leon took the celebrated city of Cordova, the residence of the firſt Mooriſh kings ; at the same time that James I. of Arragon diſposſessed them of the iland of Majorca, and drove them out of Valentia. Two years after, Ferdinand made himſelf maſter of Murcia, and took the city of Seville ; and in 1303 Ferdinand IV. reduced Gibraltar.</p><p>In the time of Edward III. we find England, for the  firſt time, interfering in the affairs of Spain, on the following occasion. In the year 1284 the kingdom of Navarre had been united to that of France by the marriage of Donna Joanna queen of Navarre with Philip the Fair of France. In 1328, however, the kingdoms were again ſeparated, though the ſovereigns of Navarre were ſtill related to thoſe of France. In 1350, Charles, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Wicked,</hi> aſcended the throne of Navarre, and married the daughter of John king of France. Notwithſtanding this alliance, and that he himſelf was related to the royal family of France, he ſecretly entered into a negociation with England againſt the French monarch, and even drew into his ſchemes the dauphin Charles, afterwards ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">the Wife.</hi> The young prince, however, was ſoon after made fully ſenſible of the danger and folly of the connections into which he had entered ; and, by way of atonement, promised to ſacriſice his associates. Accordingly he invited the king of Navarre, and ſome of the principal nobility of the ſame party, to a feaſt at Rouen, where he betrayed them to his father. The moſt obnoxious were executed, and the king of Navarre was thrown into priſon. In this extremity, the party of the king of Navarre had recourſe to England.
