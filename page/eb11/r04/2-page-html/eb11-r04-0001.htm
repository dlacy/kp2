                retained for some crimes, such as murder and high treason;&nbsp;other offences were
                punished by amputation (of hand, nose, &amp;c.).&nbsp;This system (justified by the
                passage in the New Testament, “ If&nbsp;thine eye offend thee,” &amp;c.), though to
                modern notions barbaric,&nbsp;seemed a step in the direction of leniency; and it may
                be observed&nbsp;that the tendency to avoid capital punishment increased,
                and&nbsp;we are told that in the.reign of John Comnenus it was never inflicted. (The
                same spirit, it may be noted, is apparent in the&nbsp;usual, though by no means
                invariable, practice of Byzantine&nbsp;emperors to render dethroned rivals or
                members of a deposed&nbsp;dynasty innocuous by depriving them of eyesight or forcing
                them&nbsp;to take monastic orders, instead of putting them to death.)
                The&nbsp;Church, which had its own system of penalties, exercised a
                great&nbsp;influence on the actual operation of criminal law, especially
                through&nbsp;the privilege of asylum (recognized by Justinian, but with
                many&nbsp;reserves and.restrictions), which was granted to Christian
                churches&nbsp;and is admitted without exceptions in the </span><span class="font1"

                and Phrygian emperors had done nothing&nbsp;to revive legal study. To do so was the
                aim of Basil, and the&nbsp;revival could only be based on Justinianean law books or
                their&nbsp;Greek representatives. These books were now treated somewhat&nbsp;as
                Justinian and his lawyers had treated their own predecessors.&nbsp;A handbook of
                extracts from the Institutes, Digest and Code&nbsp;was issued in
                879&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

        <p><span class="font1">fulfil somewhat the same function as the Institutes. Then a
                collection of all the laws of the Empire was prepared by means&nbsp;of two
                commissions, and completed under Leo VI. It was entitled&nbsp;the </span><span

                class="font1"> are set aside in favour of the older&nbsp;jurisprudence. Thus the
                Justinianean ordinances on the subject&nbsp;of divorce were revived, and there
                remained henceforward a contradiction between the civil and the canon
            law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">After this there was no legislation on a grand scale; but there was a
                great revival of legal study under Constantine IX., who&nbsp;founded a new
                law-school, and there were many learned specialists&nbsp;who wrote important
                commentaries, such as John Xiphilin filth&nbsp;century), Theodore Balsamon (12th
                century), Harmenopulos (14th&nbsp;century). The civil code of Moldavia (published
                1816—17) is a&nbsp;codification of Byzantine law; and modern Greece, although
                in&nbsp;framing its code it took the Napoleonic for its model,
                professes&nbsp;theoretically to base its civil law on the edicts of the emperors
                as&nbsp;contained in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Hexabiblos</span><span class="font1"> of Harmenopulos.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Administration.—</span><span class="font1"
                >Three principles underlay the administrative reform of Diocletian: the separation
                of civil from military functions; the formation of small provincial units;&nbsp;and
                the scalar structure which deepened on the interposition&nbsp;of the vicar of a
                diocese and the praetorian prefect between&nbsp;the provincial governor and the
                emperor. This system lasted&nbsp;unchanged for three and a half centuries. The few
                unimportant alterations that were made were in harmony with&nbsp;its spirit, until
                the reign of Justinian, who introduced certain&nbsp;reforms that pointed in a new
                direction. We find him combining some of the small provinces into large units,
                undermining the scalar system by doing away with some of the&nbsp;dioceses and
                vicars, and placing in some eases military and&nbsp;civil authority in the same
                hands. The chief aim of Diocletian&nbsp;in his general reform had been to secure
                central control over&nbsp;the provincial governments; the object of Justinian in
                these&nbsp;particular reforms was to remedy corruption and oppression.&nbsp;These
                changes, some of which were soon cancelled, would&nbsp;hardly in themselves have led
                to a radical change; but they&nbsp;prepared the way for an administrative
                revolution, brought&nbsp;about by stress of external necessities. In the 7th
                century&nbsp;all the energies of the Empire, girt about by active enemies,&nbsp;were
                centred on war and defence; everything had to give way&nbsp;to military exigencies;
                and a new system was gradually introduced which Jed ultimately to the abolition of
                the old. The&nbsp;change began in Italy and Africa, at the end of the 6th
                century,&nbsp;where operations against the Lombards and the Berbers
                were&nbsp;impeded by the friction between the two co-ordinate military
                and&nbsp;civil authorities (masters of soldiers, and praetorian prefects).&nbsp;The
                military governors were made supreme with the title of&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exarchs,</span><span class="font1"> “
                viceroys”; the civil authority was subordinated to&nbsp;them in ease of collision,
                otherwise remaining unaltered. The&nbsp;change is an index of the dangerous crisis
                through which these&nbsp;provinces were passing. In the East similar
                circumstances&nbsp;led to similar results. The Saracen danger hanging
                imminent&nbsp;over Asia Minor imposed a policy of the same kind. And so&nbsp;before
                the end of the 7th century we find the Empire divided&nbsp;into six great military
                provinces, three in Europe and three&nbsp;in Asia: (1) Exarchate of </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Africa,</span><span class="font1"> (2)
                Exarchate of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                Minor. In addition to these there was a naval&nbsp;circumscription, (7) the
                Strategia of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Karabisianoi</span><span class="font1"> (from&nbsp;xapa/Jo?,a vessel), including
                the southern coastland of Asia Minor,&nbsp;and the Aegean (see below under
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Navy),</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The lands of the old prefecture of Illyricum were not included in the
                system, because this part of the Empire was then regarded as a&nbsp;lost position.
                On the contrary, here military powers were committed&nbsp;to the Prefect of
                Illyricum, whose actual sphere extended little&nbsp;beyond Thessalonica, which was
                surrounded by Slavonic tribes.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Eastern changes, perhaps initiated by Heraclius, but probably due
                mainly to Constans II., did not interfere with&nbsp;the civil administration, except
                in so far as its heads were&nbsp;subordinated to the military commanders. But Leo
                III., who&nbsp;as a gieat administrative reformer ranks with Augustus
                and&nbsp;Diocletian, did away w'ith the old system altogether. ft) Reversing
                Diocletian’s principle, he combined military and civil&nbsp;powers in the same
                hands. The strategos or military commander became also a civil governor; his higher
                officers (tur-marchs) were likewise dvil functionaries. *(2) The
                scalar&nbsp;principle disappeared, including both the vicars and the&nbsp;praetorian
                prefect of the East (some of whose functions were&nbsp;merged in those of the
                prefect of the dty); no authority interposed between the strategoi and the emperor.
                (3) The new&nbsp;provinces, which were called </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">themes</span><span class="font1"> (the name marks
                their&nbsp;military origin: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >thima —</span><span class="font1"> corps), resembled in size the provinces&nbsp;of
                Augustus, each including several of the Diocletian divisions.&nbsp;This third and
                last provindal reform has, like its predecessors,&nbsp;its own history. The list of
                themes in the nth century is&nbsp;very different from that of the 8th. The changes
                were in one&nbsp;direction—the reduction of large provinces by cutting off
                parts&nbsp;to form smaller themes, a repetition of the process which&nbsp;reduced
                the provinces of Augustus. Hence the themes came&nbsp;to vary greatly in size and
                importance. Leo himself began the&nbsp;process by breaking up the Anatolic command
                into two themes&nbsp;(Anatolic and Thraeesian). The principle of splitting up
                was&nbsp;carried out systematically by Leo VI. (who was also responsible&nbsp;for a
                new ecclesiastical division of the Empire).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The development will be exhibited by a list of the themes in the
                middle of the 10th century. A. Asia: j(1) Opsikion, (2) Optimaton,</span></p>

                Scleucia)&nbsp;= old Anatolic; }(io) Armeniac, (11) Colonea, (12)

                Longibardia,&nbsp;(10) Cephallenia, (11) Cherson.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is interesting to note that up to Leo VI. the district between
                Constantinople and the wall of Anastasius formed a separate theme&nbsp;or
                government, entitled the Wall (r&lt;5 Tet^io*) or the Ditch (1$ </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T&amp;Qpcn)';&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1">Leo VI. united it with the theme of Thrace.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the central administration, the general principles seem to have
                remained unchanged; the heads of the great administrative&nbsp;bureaux in
                Constantinople retain the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >palatine</span><span class="font1"> character which&nbsp;belonged to most of them
                from the beginning. But there were&nbsp;many changes in these offices, in their
                nomenclature and the&nbsp;delimitation of their functions. There are great
                differences&nbsp;between the administrative corps in the $th, in the 10th
                and&nbsp;in the 15th centuries. We can hardly be wrong in conjecturing&nbsp;that,
                along with his provincial reform, Leo III. made a rearrangement of the central
                bureaux; the abolition of the&nbsp;Praetorian Prefecture of the East entailed, in
                itself, modifications. But minor changes were continually being made, and&nbsp;we
                may note the following tendencies: (1) Increase in the&nbsp;number of ministers
