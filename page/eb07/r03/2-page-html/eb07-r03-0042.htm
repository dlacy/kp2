<p><span class="font0">lost nearly forty&quot;thousand men, partly in unsuccessful skirmishes with the enemy, but chiefly from disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Galitzin was thus trifling away his time in the south, Peter, who already began to give proofs of those&nbsp;great talents which afterwards enabled him to act so conspicuous a part in the theatre of the north, was strengthening his party among the Russian nobles. His ordinary residence was at a village not far from Moscow, and here he&nbsp;had assembled round him a considerable number of young&nbsp;men of rank and influence, whom he called his play-mates.&nbsp;Among these were two foreigners, Lefort a Genevese, and&nbsp;Gordon a Scotchman, who afterwards signalized themselves&nbsp;in his service. These young men had formed a sort of military company, of which Lefort was captain ; and the young&nbsp;czar, beginning with the situation of drummer, gradually&nbsp;rose through every subordinate office. Under this appearance of a military game, Peter was secretly establishing&nbsp;himself in the affections of his young companions, and effectually lulled the suspicions of Sophia, till it was too late&nbsp;for her to oppose his machinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About the middle of the year 1689, Peter, who had now attained his seventeenth year, determined to make an effort&nbsp;to deprive Sophia of all share in the government, and to&nbsp;secure to himself the undivided sovereignty. On occasion&nbsp;of a solemn religious meeting that was held, Sophia had&nbsp;claimed the principal place, as regent of the empire ; but&nbsp;this claim was strenuously opposed by Peter, who, rather&nbsp;than fill a subordinate situation, quitted the place of assembly, and, with his friends and adherents, withdrew to the&nbsp;monastery of the Holy Trinity, which had formerly sheltered&nbsp;him and his copartners from the fury of the Strelitzes. This&nbsp;was the signal for an open rupture. Sophia, finding that&nbsp;she could not openly oppose the party of the czar, attempted to procure his assassination ; but as her design was discovered, she thought proper to solicit an accommodation.&nbsp;This was agreed to, on condition that she should give up&nbsp;all claim to the regency, and retire to a nunnery. The&nbsp;commander of the Strelitzes, her agent in the assassination of Peter, was beheaded, and the minister Galitzin sent&nbsp;into banishment to Archangel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter now saw himself in undisputed possession of the imperial throne ; for though Ivan was still nominally czar,&nbsp;he had voluntarily resigned all share in the administration&nbsp;of affairs, and retired to a life of obscurity. The first object to which the czar directed his attention was the establishment of a regular and well-disciplined military force.&nbsp;He had learned by experience how little dependence was&nbsp;to be placed on the Strelitzes ; and these regiments he determined to disband. He commissioned Lefort and Gordon to levy new regiments, which, in their whole constitution, dress, and military exercises, should be formed on the&nbsp;model of other European troops. He next resolved to carry into execution the design which had been formed by his&nbsp;father, of constructing a navy. For this purpose he first&nbsp;took a journey to Archangel, where he employed himself&nbsp;in examining the operations of the shipwrights, and occasionally taking a part in their labours ; but as he learned&nbsp;that the art of ship-building was practised in greater perfection in Holland, and some other maritime countries of&nbsp;Europe, he sent thither several young Russians to be initiated into the best methods of constructing ships of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The war with Turkey still languished, but Peter was resolved to prosecute it with vigour, hoping to get possession <sup>,</sup> of the town of Azof, and thus open a passage to the Black&nbsp;Sea. He placed Gordon, Lefort, and two of his nobles, at&nbsp;the head of the forces destined for this expedition, and himself attended the army as a private volunteer. The success of the first campaign was but trifling ; and Peter learned that his deficiency of artillery and his want of transports&nbsp;prevented him from making an effectual attack on Azof.&nbsp;These difficulties, however, were soon surmounted. He&nbsp;procured a supply of artillery and engineers from the emperor and the Dutch, and found means to provide a number of transports. With these auxiliaries he opened the&nbsp;second campaign, defeated the Turks on the Sea of Azof,&nbsp;and made himself master of the town. Peter was so elated&nbsp;with these successes, that on his return from the seat of war&nbsp;he marched his troops into Moscow in a triumphal procession, in which Lefort as admiral of the transports, and&nbsp;Schein as commander of the land forces, bore the most conspicuous parts, while Peter himself was lost without distinction in the crowd of subaltern officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He now resolved to form a fleet in the Black Sea ; but as his own revenues were insufficient for this purpose, he&nbsp;issued a ukase, commanding the patriarch and other dignified clergy, the nobility, and the merchants, to contribute a&nbsp;part of their income towards fitting out a certain number&nbsp;of ships. This proclamation was extremely unpopular, and,&nbsp;together with the numerous innovations which Peter was&nbsp;every day introducing, especially his sending the young&nbsp;nobles to visit foreign countries, and his own avowed intention of making the tour of Europe, contributed to raise&nbsp;against him a formidable party. The vigilance and prudence of the czar, however, extricated him from the dangers with which he was threatened, and enabled him to&nbsp;carry into execution his proposed journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In returning to his own dominions, Peter passed through Rawa, where Augustus king of Poland then was. The czar&nbsp;had determined, in conjunction with Augustus and the king&nbsp;of Denmark, to take advantage of the youth and inexperience ofCharles XII. who had just succeeded to the Swedish&nbsp;throne ; and in this interview with Augustus, he made the&nbsp;final arrangements for the part which each was to take in&nbsp;the war. Augustus was to receive Livonia as his part of&nbsp;the spoil, while Frederick king of Denmark had his eye on&nbsp;Holstein, and Peter had formed designs on Ingria, formerly&nbsp;a province of the Russian empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the middle of the year 1700, Charles had left his capital to oppose these united enemies. He soon compelled the king of Denmark to give up his designs on Holstein,&nbsp;and sign a treaty of peace ; and being thus at liberty to&nbsp;turn his arms against the other members of the confederacy,&nbsp;he resolved first to lead his army against the king of Poland ;&nbsp;but on his way he received intelligence that the czar had&nbsp;laid siege to Narva with an army which some authorities&nbsp;calculate at a hundred thousand men. On this he immediately embarked at Carlscrona, though it was then the&nbsp;depth of winter, and the Baltic was scarcely navigable ; and&nbsp;soon landed at Pernaw in Livonia with part of his forces,&nbsp;having ordered the rest to Revel. His army did not exceed twenty thousand men, but it was composed of the&nbsp;best soldiers in Europe, while that of the Russians was&nbsp;little better than an undisciplined multitude. Every possible obstruction, however, had been thrown in the way of&nbsp;the Swedes. Thirty thousand Russians were posted in a&nbsp;defile on the road, and this corps was sustained by another&nbsp;body of twenty thousand drawn up some leagues nearer&nbsp;Narva. Peter himself had set out to hasten the march&nbsp;of a reinforcement of forty thousand men, w<sup>r</sup>ith whom he&nbsp;intended to attack the Swedes in flank and rear ; but the&nbsp;celerity and valour of Charles baffled every attempt to oppose him. He set out with four thousand foot and an&nbsp;equal number of cavalry, leaving the rest of the army to&nbsp;follow at their leisure. With this small body he attacked&nbsp;and defeated the Russian armies successively, and pushed&nbsp;his way to Peter’s camp, for the attack of which he gave&nbsp;immediate orders. This camp was fortified by lines of cir-cumvallation and contravallation, by redoubts, and by a&nbsp;line of a hundred and fifty brass cannons placed in front ;&nbsp;and it was defended by an army of eighty thousand men ;&nbsp;yet so violent was the attack of the Swedes, that in three&nbsp;hours the intrenchments were carried, and Charles, with</span></p>
