<p><span class="font1">from the plains to the mountains, and after the gathering of the harvest, tile Maremme are abandoned, on account of the&nbsp;malaria The leases in these districts are sometimes subset&nbsp;to smaller cultivators, and even subdivided into small fractions. But in other parts of the country leases are rarely&nbsp;granted ; land is almost all colonized, that is, farmed on the&nbsp;mezzeria principle, a system which is productive of the worst&nbsp;results. The general arrangement is, that the landowner&nbsp;shall receive from the coloni half the produce of the soil ;&nbsp;but there are many cases in which the amount received is&nbsp;not one-sixth of the produce. The coloni are generally in&nbsp;debt to their landlords, and are often in a state of insolvency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Roman states produce a supply of cattle sufficient for the ordinary consumption. Horses are exported, and&nbsp;there is a small importation of oxen and swine. The breed&nbsp;of sheep is improving, and the export of wool is considerable, and is rapidly increasing. Olive plantations were long&nbsp;one of the most productive investments ; but they are now&nbsp;less so than the cultivation of the white mulberry, which would&nbsp;spread widely were capital abundant. Vineyards have been&nbsp;too extensively planted, and now yield no return equivalent&nbsp;to the outlay. The culture of the wheat has diminished&nbsp;solely from the absence of external demand, and the consequent decline of prices. The instruments of husbandry&nbsp;employed are of the rudest kind. The heavy customs have&nbsp;prevented the introduction of improved implements, and&nbsp;the arts are too little advanced to allow their production at&nbsp;home. The principal impediments in the Roman states&nbsp;to agricultural improvements are, the political situation of&nbsp;the country ; the protecting system, which keeps all the&nbsp;producing powers in backwardness ; the want of capital ;&nbsp;the want of population in the Maremme, and the mezzeria&nbsp;system elsewhere ; the want of knowledge, and more especially of agricultural knowledge ; the extreme difficulty&nbsp;proprietors have in finding managers for their estates who&nbsp;are able and willing to introduce the improvements that&nbsp;have been adopted elsewhere ; mortmain, the heavy burden of taxation falling particularly on proprietors, agriculturists, and their productions, and the difficulty of sales&nbsp;from restricted relations.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population of the Roman states in general is rather agricultural than manufacturing, and their manufactures&nbsp;serve only for the home consumption. There is little demand for them abroad. The papal government has made&nbsp;enormous sacrifices, by protections, prohibitions, and premiums, for the encouragement of what is called native industry ; but these measures, so far from increasing and improving manufacturing produce, have been the main causes&nbsp;of decline and decay. Their only effect has been to reward&nbsp;and to render permanent the most rude and ignorant processes of manufacture. Scarcely a valuable discovery has&nbsp;been introduced into their manufactories, and the looms are&nbsp;still such as were generally employed in the fourteenth century. Many a town in Great Britain, consisting only of&nbsp;30,000 souls, produces a greater quantity of manufactured&nbsp;articles than the three million inhabitants of the pontifical&nbsp;states. The principal manufacture is that of woollens of&nbsp;ordinary quality. Rome is the chief seat of this manufacture, and the value of the fabrics produced annually, is calculated at 300,000 crowms, (L.60,000.) Next to woollens&nbsp;stands the manufacture of hats. They are well made every&nbsp;where, but especially at Rome, and to the amount of&nbsp;200,000 crowns, (L.40,000.) There are silk manufactories&nbsp;in Rome, Bologna, Camerino, and Brugia ; but the trade is&nbsp;declining. Next in importance to woollen and silk manufactories, are those of tanned and dressed leather. Gloves&nbsp;are made in Rome and Bologna, to the extent of from&nbsp;90,000 to 100,000 pairs annually. Roman musical strings&nbsp;enjoy a very ancient and deserved reputation. The annual&nbsp;quantity made amounts in value to 10,000 crowns. There&nbsp;are scarely any manufactories of cotton goods. The government has made great sacrifices to maintain an establishment at the Diocletian baths, but without success. The&nbsp;fabrics of hemp and flax are more numerous than those of&nbsp;cotton, but there are no factories ; all the goods produced&nbsp;are manufactured either in public schools, orphan asylums, or&nbsp;private houses. The other articles of manufacture are&nbsp;ropes and cordage, wax and tallow candles, paper, cream&nbsp;of tartar, liquorice juice, pig iron, copper manufactures,&nbsp;earthenware, and glass. An extensive trade was formerly&nbsp;carried on in alum, which was dug in large quantities in the&nbsp;mountains of Tolfa, but the introduction of artificial alum,&nbsp;by lowering the prices, has greatly diminished this trade.&nbsp;Riaw sulphur is found in large quantities and of excellent&nbsp;quality. After supplying the home consumption, both raw&nbsp;and refined sulphur are exported to the amount of four&nbsp;million lbs. giving an annual proceed of 120,000 crowns.&nbsp;The sulphuric manufactures of Bologna produce annually&nbsp;50,000 lbs. of sulphuric, and 10,000 lbs. of nitric acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The trade of the Roman states is far from extensive or flourishing. The principal exports are com from Romagna&nbsp;and the frontier districts ; but this trade is diminishing.&nbsp;Sheep 50,000 yearly, swine 40,000, oxen 10,000. The export to England of Roman wool is become very considerable, and is increasing rapidly. The provinces on the west&nbsp;of the Apennines export from 800,000 to 900,090 lbs. of&nbsp;wool for Piedmont and France. A million lbs. of cheese&nbsp;go to Tuscany and Sardinia ; of lambs skins, about 400,000&nbsp;lbs. are shipped to England, Piedmont, and Naples. Of&nbsp;horns and bones, there is an export of 15,000 lbs. ; of honey,&nbsp;10,000 lbs. ; of skins, 100,000 lbs. ; of tallow, 200,000 lbs. ;&nbsp;of lard and fat, 150,000 lbs.; of hemp, 30 millions of lbs.;&nbsp;of white and brown rags, 3 millions lbs. ; of oil, 1 million&nbsp;lbs. ; of tobacco, 300,000 lbs., but the government monopoly is a great impediment to the extended cultivation of&nbsp;a plant to which the soil is well adapted. There is a large&nbsp;export of planks to Spain, America, and France, besides&nbsp;other articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The imports are to some extent affected by the circumstance, that a chain of mountains traverses the country, making the north-west almost inaccessible to the south, so&nbsp;that while one part of the state is exporting, another is im&nbsp;porting the same article. Colonial produce is received&nbsp;principally from England and France ; and the consumption&nbsp;is, of raw sugar, 10,000,000 lbs.; coffee, 1,600,000 lbs.;&nbsp;pepper, 1,000,000 lbs.; cocoa, 50,000 lbs.; cinnamon,&nbsp;40,000 lbs.; cloves, 35,000 lbs.; and raw cotton, 150,000&nbsp;lbs. Of other principal articles, the yearly imports are,&nbsp;from 40,000 to 50,000 sheep ; from 12,000 to 13,000 calves&nbsp;or oxen; 8000 to 9000 swine; 16,000 to 1.8,000 cows;&nbsp;some costly horses, principally for the capital ; hides, about&nbsp;1,200,000 lbs.; raw skins, 50,000 lbs.; coarse wool for&nbsp;mattresses, 1,000,000 lbs. ; cheese, 1,300,000 lbs. ; butter,&nbsp;70,000 lbs. ; wax, 700,000 lbs. ; cochineal and kernes, salt&nbsp;fish from England, 8,700,000 lbs.; about 3,000,000 lbs.&nbsp;more of pilchards, Sardinian salmon, &amp;c. are brought from&nbsp;Spain, France, Sicily, and Russia.</span></p>
