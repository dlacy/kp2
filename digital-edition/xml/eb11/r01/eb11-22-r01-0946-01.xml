<p><label>REAR</label>
the back or hind portion of anything, particularly a military or naval term for that part of a force which is placed last in order, in opposition to “ van.” As the last word, shortened from “ van-guard,” is an aphetic form of Fr. <hi rend="italic">avant,</hi> in front, Lat. <hi rend="italic">ab ante,</hi> so “ rear ” is an aphetic form of “ arrear,” O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">arere,</hi> mod. <hi rend="italic">arrière,</hi> Med. Lat. <hi rend="italic">ad retro,</hi> to the back, backward. From this word must be distinguished the verb “ to rear,” used in two main senses: of a horse, to stand up on its hind legs, and to raise up or lift, of the construction of a building or of the breeding and bringing to maturity of domestic or other animals, often used also of young children. The O.E. <hi rend="italic">ræran,</hi> of which it is the modem representative, is a doublet of the Scandinavian <hi rend="italic">reisa,</hi> which has given English “ raise,” both being causative verb forms of “ rise.”</p>
