<p><span class="font1">John? Certainly the external testimony is very good,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> the doubts entertained by the Alexandrians, by Eusebius, and&nbsp;by Byzantine theologians as to the apostolic authorship of&nbsp;the book have not much weight, the book being little to&nbsp;their mind, and the substance of the Revelation would in&nbsp;many respects suit John Boanerges. But the following&nbsp;considerations speak against the apostle John as author :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the so-called “Alogi” (Epiph., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hær.,</span><span class="font1"> li.) denied that&nbsp;the work was by the apostle, and declared that it came&nbsp;from Corinth and hence was a forgery ; but the Alogi&nbsp;were in Asia Minor about 160 and their negative, if&nbsp;not their positive, evidence has therefore great weight ;</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the author of the Apocalypse does not style himself an&nbsp;apostle, and nowhere does he designate himself as a personal disciple of Jesus or as an eye-witness; (3) the&nbsp;author speaks (xxi. 14) in such an objective way of the&nbsp;twelve apostles of the Lamb that it is scarcely credible that&nbsp;he himself belonged to them ; (4) the descriptions of&nbsp;Christ in the Apocalypse are psychologically scarcely intelligible on the assumption that they were written by a personal disciple of the Lord. On these grounds we must say&nbsp;that, though not quite impossible, it is very improbable that&nbsp;the apostle John was the author of the Apocalypse. But&nbsp;not less improbable is the supposition that the real author&nbsp;wished to pass for the apostle John and fathered the work&nbsp;on him. It is true that amongst the Jews apocalypses&nbsp;were fathered by their authors on famous men ; but the&nbsp;fraud is always very patent. But in this case the name of&nbsp;John occurs only four times (i. 1, 4, 9 ; xxii. 8), and in the&nbsp;whole book there is nothing that reveals the author’s&nbsp;intention to pass for the apostle John. And we have&nbsp;further to remember that, according to trustworthy evidence, the apostle John was still living at the time in Asia&nbsp;Minor. It is at least improbable that another dweller in&nbsp;Asia Minor should have fathered a book on him under his&nbsp;very eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In these circumstances only one hypothesis seems left —that started by the Alexandrians in order to get rid of&nbsp;the inconvenient authority of the Apocalypse—that the&nbsp;book is from the pen of another John in Asia Minor,&nbsp;namely, the presbyter. But, though this hypothesis has&nbsp;had much acceptance in our time, it is far from probable ;&nbsp;for-—and here Zahn and Renan are right—the existence of&nbsp;a conspicuous presbyter John in distinction from the&nbsp;apostle is very uncertain. The Apocalypse, as the traditional text of the first chapter now runs, is certainly not&nbsp;the work of any ordinary person of the name of John : it is&nbsp;by a John who enjoyed the highest consideration in the&nbsp;churches (see i. 1, 4). If besides the apostle John there&nbsp;was no second John who possessed such authority in Asia&nbsp;Minor in the 1st century, and if it is impossible that the&nbsp;Apocalypse can be the work either of the apostle John or&nbsp;of a literary forger, the only supposition left is that the&nbsp;name of John was interpolated in the last revision (after&nbsp;the death of the apostle John). Observe once more that&nbsp;this name occurs only in the first verses of the first chapter,&nbsp;and in a verse of the last. No hypothesis solves the problem so well as this. Whether originally a different name&nbsp;appeared in i. 9, and how ch. i. gradually arose, are questions into which we cannot enter here. In this difficult subject absolute certainty is unattainable, but the supposition&nbsp;that the Revelation was written by an unknown Christian&nbsp;of Asia Minor, and that the name of John is a later addition</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">in order to ascribe the Revelation to the apostle John, labours under fewer difficulties than any other that has&nbsp;hitherto been started. That, thus introduced, John is not&nbsp;expressly designated as apostle need not surprise us, for at&nbsp;the beginning of the 2d century every one in Asia Minor&nbsp;knew who “John the servant of God” was. The epistles&nbsp;also with the heading “the elder” are meant to be&nbsp;regarded as written by the apostle John, although they do&nbsp;not contain the title apostle.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Authority in the Church.—</span><span class="font1">The Apocalypse, which as early as the time of Justin and Papias enjoyed a high reputation as the work of the apostle John, was admitted&nbsp;into the canon of the New Testament (see Murat, fragm.,&nbsp;Irenæus, Tertullian). In the West it has always been&nbsp;retained in the canon, but in the East it was discredited&nbsp;through Montanism, and the spiritualistic Alexandrians who&nbsp;gave the tone threw more and more doubts upon it, so that&nbsp;towards the end of the 3d century it began to be omitted&nbsp;from the New Testament. For nearly a thousand years&nbsp;the Apocalypse was not recognized by the majority of the&nbsp;Greek Church as a canonical book (and hence it is that&nbsp;we possess so few ancient Greek MSS. of the Apocalypse),&nbsp;but, as no formal condemnation was pronounced against it,&nbsp;the book was never suppressed, and regained its footing&nbsp;towards the end of the Middle Ages, the Greek Church&nbsp;following the example of the Latin. At present the&nbsp;Apocalypse forms part of the New Testament all over&nbsp;Christendom, and rightly so, for it is one of the most&nbsp;instructive documents of early Christianity. Narrow or&nbsp;dogmatic spirits, it is true, will never be able to value it&nbsp;aright, and will therefore either reject it or seek to correct&nbsp;it by false interpretations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal, however, must not be made to the fact that according to&nbsp;tradition the apostle John was banished to Patmos, and that the&nbsp;author of the Apocalypse says of himself (i. 9), “ I was in the isle that&nbsp;is called Patmos for the word of God, ” for the tradition is based on the&nbsp;Apocalypse, and, what is more, on a misunderstanding of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Eusebius, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IL E.,</span><span class="font0"> iii. 28, 1 many have assumed that the&nbsp;Roman presbyter Caius (about 200 a.d.) was of the same opinion as&nbsp;the Alogi, but this is improbable.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> The view here put forward as to the author of the Apocalypse is further recommended by its agreement with the general history of early&nbsp;Christian literature in the church. Originally writings derived their&nbsp;authority from the nature of their contents, afterwards from their&nbsp;author. When writings by obscure persons were intended to attract&nbsp;attention, it was necessary to pass them off under the names of celebrities ; see Harnack, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Lehre der 12 Apostel,</span><span class="font0"> p. 106 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
