<p><span class="font2">short, near-sighted, ugly and exceptionally awkward. Retz, however, despite the little inclination which he felt towards&nbsp;clerical life, entered into the disputes of the Sorbonne with&nbsp;vigour, and when he was scarcely eighteen wrote the remarkable&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conjuration de Fiesque<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font2">  a little historical essay, of which he drew&nbsp;the materiaI from the Itahan of Augustino Mascardi, but which&nbsp;is all his own in the negligent vigour of the style and the audacious&nbsp;insinuation, if nothing more, of revolutionary principles. Retz&nbsp;received no preferment of importance during Richelieu’s life,&nbsp;and even after the minister’s death, though he was presented to&nbsp;Louis XIII. and well received, he found a difficulty in attaining&nbsp;the coadjutorship with reversion of the archbishopric of Paris.&nbsp;But Utmost immediately after the king’s death Anne of Austria&nbsp;appointed him to the coveted post on All Saints’ Eve, 1643.&nbsp;Retz, who had, according to some accounts, already plotted&nbsp;against Richeheu, set himself to work to make the utmost&nbsp;political capital out of his position. His uncle, who was old,&nbsp;indolent and absurdly proud, had Hved in great seclusion;&nbsp;Retz, on the contrary, gradually acquired a very great influence&nbsp;with the populace of the city. This influence he gradually&nbsp;turned against Mazarin. No one had more to do than Retz with&nbsp;the outbreak of the Fronde in October 1648, and his history&nbsp;for the next four years is the history of that confused and, as a&nbsp;rule, much misunderstood movement. Of the two parties who&nbsp;joined in it Retz could only depend on the bourgeoisie of Paris.&nbsp;The fact, moreover, that although he had some speculative&nbsp;tendencies in favour of popular liberties, and even perhaps of&nbsp;republicanism, he represented no real political principle, inevitably weakened his position, and when the break up of the&nbsp;Fronde came he was left in the lurch, having more than once in&nbsp;the meanwhile been in no small danger from his own party.&nbsp;One stroke of luck, however, fell to him before his downfall.&nbsp;He was made cardinal almost by accident, and under a misapprehension on the pope’s part. Then, in 1652, he was arrested&nbsp;and imprisoned, first at Vincennes, then at Nantes; he escaped,&nbsp;however, after two years’ captivity, and for some time wandered&nbsp;about in various countries. He made his appearance at Rome&nbsp;more than once, and had no small influence in the election of&nbsp;Alexander VII. Hewas at last, in 1662, received back again&nbsp;into favour by Louis XIV. and on more than one occasion&nbsp;formally served as envoy to Rome. Retz, however, was glad&nbsp;in making his peace to resign his claims to the archbishopric&nbsp;of Paris. The terms were, among other things, his appointment&nbsp;to the rich abbacy of St Denis and his restoration to his other&nbsp;benefices with the payment of arrears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The last seventeen years of Retz’s life were passed partly in his diplomatic duties * (he was again in Rome at the papal&nbsp;election of 1668), partly at Paris, partly at his estate of Corn-mercy, but latterly at St Mihiel in Lorraine. His debts were&nbsp;enormous, and in 1675 he resolved to make over to his creditors&nbsp;all his income except twenty thousand livres, and, as he said, to&nbsp;'“ live for ” them. This plan he carried out, though he did not&nbsp;succeed in Hving very long, for he died at Paris on the 24th&nbsp;August 1679. One of the chief authorities for the last years of&nbsp;Retz is Madame de Sevigne, whose connexion he was by marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Retz and La Rochefoucauld, the greatest of the Frondeurs in literary genius, were personal and political enemies, and each&nbsp;has left a portrait of the other. La Rochefoucauld’s character&nbsp;of the cardinal is on the whole harsh but scarcely unjust, and&nbsp;one of its sentences formulates, though in a manner which has a&nbsp;certain recoil upon the writer, the great defect of Retz’s conduct:&nbsp;“ Il a suscité lös plus grands désordres dans l’état sans avoir&nbsp;un dessein formé de s’en prévaloir.” He would have been less,&nbsp;and certainly less favourably, remembered if it had not been&nbsp;for his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs.</span><span class="font2"> They were certainly not written till the last&nbsp;ten years of his life, and they do not go further than the year&nbsp;1655. They are addressed in the form of narrative to a lady&nbsp;who is not known, though guesses have been made at her identity,&nbsp;some even suggesting Madame de Sévignê herself. In the beginning there are some gaps. They display, in a rather irregular&nbsp;style and with some oddities of dialect and phrase, extraordinary&nbsp;narrative skill and a high degree of ability in that special art&nbsp;of the 17 th century—the drawing of verbal portraits or characters.&nbsp;Few things of the kind are superior to the sketch of the early&nbsp;barricade, of the Fronde in which the writer had so great a&nbsp;share, the hesitations of the court, the bold adventure of the&nbsp;coadjutor himself into the palace and the final triumph of the&nbsp;insurgents. Dumas, who has drawn from this passage one of&nbsp;his very best scenes in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vingt ans après,</span><span class="font2"> has done Uttle but throw&nbsp;Retz into dialogue and amplify his language and incidents.&nbsp;Besides these memoirs and the very striking youthful essay of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conjuration de Fiesque,</span><span class="font2"> Retz has left diplomatic papers,&nbsp;sermons, Mazarinades and correspondence in some considerable&nbsp;quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font1"> of. the cardinal de Retz were first published in a very imperfect condition in 1717 at Nancy. The first satisfactory&nbsp;edition was that which appeared in the twenty-fourth volume of&nbsp;the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat (Paris, 1836). They were&nbsp;then re-edited from the autograph manuscript by Géruzez (Paris,&nbsp;1844), and by Champollion-Figeac with the Mazannades, &amp;c. (Paris,&nbsp;1859). In 1870 a complete edition of the works of Retz was begun&nbsp;by M. </span><span class="font2">A. </span><span class="font1">Feillet in the collection of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grands Écrivains.</span><span class="font1"> The editor&nbsp;dying, this passed into the hands of M. Gourdault and then into&nbsp;those of M. Chantelauze, who had already published studies on the&nbsp;connexion of St Vincent de Paul with the Gondi family, &amp;c. (1882).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REUBEN, a tribe of Israel named after the eldest “ son ” of Jacob and of Leah. Both the meaning of the name (see Gen.&nbsp;xxix. 3 2) and the history of the tribe are extremely obscure. In&nbsp;one version of the story of Joseph, Reuben appears in a somewhat favourable light (Gen. xxxvii. 22, 29, xlii. 37), but in&nbsp;Gen. xxxv. 22 he is charged with a grave offence, which in&nbsp;Gen. xlix. 4 is given as a reason why the tribe which called&nbsp;him father did not take in Hebrew history the place proper to&nbsp;its seniority (cp. 1 Chron. v. 1). Dathan and Abiram were&nbsp;Reubenites (Num. xvi.; Deut. xi. 6), and in Deut. </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">xxxiii</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font2">6 the&nbsp;tribe appears as threatened with extinction. In Judg. v. 15 seq.&nbsp;it is described as a pastoral tribe which took no share in the&nbsp;patriotic movement under Barak and Deborah. The district&nbsp;allotted to Reuben (Josh. xiii. 15-23; Num. xxxii. 37 seq.) is&nbsp;detailed in late passages which have little historical value for&nbsp;the age to which they are attributed. The tribe is represented&nbsp;as settled E. of the Jordan on the Moabite border, but no mention&nbsp;is made of it in the inscription of the Moabite king AIesha&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gad; Moab).</span><span class="font2"> The references to the tribe’s wars against&nbsp;Arabians (1 Chron. v. 10, 18 sqq.) in the time of Saul have&nbsp;caused much fruitless speculation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REUCHLIN, JOHANN (1455-1522), German humanist and Hebraist, was born on the 22nd of February 1455 at Pforzheim&nbsp;in the Black Forest, where his father was an official of the&nbsp;Dominican monastery. In, the pedantic taste of his time the&nbsp;name was graecicized by his Italian friends into Capnion, a&nbsp;form which Reuchlin himself uses as a sort of transparent mask&nbsp;when he introduces himself as an interlocutor in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo&nbsp;Mirifico.</span><span class="font2"> For his native place Reuchlin always retained an&nbsp;affection; he constantly writes himself Phorcensis, and in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo</span><span class="font2"> he does not forget to ascribe to Pforzheim his first&nbsp;disposition to letters. Here he began his Latin studies in the&nbsp;monastery school, and, though in 1470 he was a short time in&nbsp;Freiburg, that university seems to have taught him little.&nbsp;Reuchlin’s career as a scholar appears to have turned almost&nbsp;on an accident; his fine voice gained him a place in the household of Charles I., margrave of Baden, and by-and-by, having&nbsp;already some reputation as a Latinist, he was chosen to accompany to the university of Paris Frederick, the third son of the&nbsp;prince, a lad some years bis junior, who was destined for an&nbsp;ecclesiastical career. This new connexion lasted but a year or&nbsp;so, but it determined the course of Reuchlin’s life. He now&nbsp;began to leam Greek, which had been taught in the French&nbsp;capital since 1470, and he also attached himself to the leader&nbsp;of the Paris realists, Jean Heynlin, or à Lapide (d. 1496), a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
