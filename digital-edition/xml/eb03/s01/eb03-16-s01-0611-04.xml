or <hi rend="smallcaps">salique, Law,</hi> <hi rend="italic">(Lex Salica),</hi> an ancient and fundamental law of the kingdom of France, uſually ſuppoſed to have been made by Pharamond, or at leaſt by Clovis; in virtue whereof males only are to inherit.</p><p>Some, as Poſtellus, would have it to have been called <hi rend="italic">Salic,</hi> q. d. <hi rend="italic">Gallic,</hi> becauſe peculiar to the Gauls. Fer Montanus inſiſts, it was becauſe Pharamond was at firſt called <hi rend="italic">Salrcus.</hi> Others will have it to be ſo named, as having been made for the ſalic lands. Theſe were noble fiefs which their firſt kings uſed to beſtow on the ſallians, that is, the great lords of their falle or court, without any other tenure than military ſervice; and for this reaſon, ſuch fieſs were not to deſcend to women, as being by nature unfit for ſuch a tenure. Some, again, derive the origin of this word from the Salians, a tribe of Franks that ſettled in Gaul in the reign of Julian, who is ſaid to have given them lands on condition or their perſonal ſervice in war. He even paſſed the conditions into a law, which the new conquerors acquieſced in, and called it <hi rend="italic">ſalic,</hi> from the name of their former countrymen.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
