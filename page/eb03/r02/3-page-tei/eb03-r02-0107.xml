To the cape where he firſt landed, he gave the name <hi rend="italic">Paiinurus,</hi>  ſrom one of his pilots who died there. The little iſland of Leuca∙ fia, not far diſtant, whither he ſailed next, got its name in like manner from a daughter of Æneas’s filler, who there ended her days. The port of Miſenum, the iſland of Prochyta, and the promontory of Cajeta, where he ſucceſſively arrived’, were ſo called from being the burial places, the firſt of a noble l’rojan his companion, the ſecond of his kinſwoman, and the third of his ηurfe. At length the Trojan prince and his choſen band finiſhed their tedious and painful voyages on the coaſt of the ſince famous Latium. This was a ſmall territory on the eaſt ſide of the river Tiber, containing a part of the preſent <hi rend="italic">Cavpagna di Roma :</hi>  Latinus was the king of it ; 'his capital town, Laurentum ; his fubjects, a people who, till his time called <hi rend="italic">Aborigines, </hi>had from him taken the name of <hi rend="italic">Latins.</hi>  Here, far removed from their implacable enemies the Greeks, Æneas and his followers undertook to raiſe a ſecond Troy: they fortified a camp near the mouth of the Ty-ber, gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">Troy,</hi>  and flattered themſelves with the hopes of a quiet ſettlement, and a period to .all their unhappy adventures.</p><p>When Æneas arrived in Italy, Latinus was engaged in a war with the Rutuli, a neighbouring people, in which he was attended but with very indifferent ſucceſs, •when news was brought him that a foreign army had made a deſcent on his coaſts, pillaged the maritime part of his dominions, and were fortifying themſelves in a eamp at a ſmall diſtance from the ſea. Hereupon he marched againſt them with all his forces, hoping to oblige them to reimbark and abandon his dominions, without meeting with any great reſiſtance from a band of vagabonds, as he ſuppoſed, or pirates, come only to ſeek ſor plunder: but finding them, as he drew near, well-armed, and regularly drawn up, he thought it advifable to forbear engaging troops that appeared ſo well diſciplined ; and, inſtead of venturing a battle, to deſire a parley. In this conference Latinus underſtanding who they were, and being at the ſame time ſtruck with terror, and touched with com-paſſion for thoſe brave but unfortunate men, entered into a treaty with them, and aſſigned them a tract of land for a ſettlement, on condition that they ſhould employ their arms and exert their valour in defence of his dominions, and look upon the Rutuli as a common enemy. This condition Æneas readily accepted; and’ complied with his engagement ſo faithfully, that Latinus came at length to repoſe an entire confidence in the Trojan ; and in proof of it gave him Lavinia, his daughter and only child, in marriage, ſecuring to him by that means the ſucceſſion to the throne of Latinm. Æneas, to teftify his gratitude to Latinus, and affection. for Lavinia, gave her name to the camp he had' pitched ; and inſtead of Troy called it <hi rend="italic">Lavi-fiium.</hi>  The Trojans followed the example of their leader ; and by making alliances with La∙tin families, became, in a ſhort time, one and the ſame people with the Latins.</p><p>in the mean time Turnus, the queen’s nephew, who had been brought up in the palace under the eye of Latinus, and entertained hopes of marrying Lavinia and ſucceeding to the throne, ſeeing the princeſs bellowed on a ſtranger, and all his views defeated, went</p><lb/><p>over to the Rutuli ; and by ſtirring them up, 'brought on a battle between them and the Latins, in which both he and Latinus were killed. Thus Æneas, by the death of his father-in-law, and by that of a troubleſome rival, came into the quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom of Latium, which he governed with great wiſdom, and tranſmitted to his poſterity.</p><p>Æneas is ſaid to have reigned three years ; during which time he eſtabliſhed the worſhip of the gods of his own country, and to the religion of the Latins added that of Troy. The two Palladiums, which had been the protectors of that city, became the tutelary deities of Lavinium, and, in after ages, of the whole Roman empire. The worſhip of Veſta was likewiſe introduced by Æneas ; and virgins, from her called <hi rend="italic">Peflals,</hi>  were appointed to keep a fire continually burning in honour of that goddeſs. Jupiter, Venus, and many other deities who had been revered in Troy, became, in all likelihood, known to the Latins by means of Æneas; which gave occaſion to the poets of repreſenting him under the character of a pious hero.</p><p>While Æneas was thus employed, the Rutuli, ancient enemies of the Latin name, entering into an alliance with Mezentius king of the Tyrrhenians, took the field with a deſign to drive out thoſe new-comers, of whoſe power they began to conceive .no ſmall jea-louſy. Æneas marched out againſt them at the head of his Trojans and Latins. Hereupon a battle enſued, which laſted till night ; when Æneas being puſhed to the banks of the Numicus, which ran cloſe by Lavinium, and forced into that river, was there drowned, ſt he Trojans concealed his body ; and pretending that he had vaniſhed away on a ſudden, made him paſs for a deity among his credulous ſubjects, who accordingly erected a temple to him under the title of <hi rend="italic">'Jupiter In-diges.</hi></p><p>Upon the death of Æneas, his fon Euryleon, called alſo <hi rend="italic">Aſcanius</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">lulus,</hi>  aſcended the throne ; but as the young king did not think it adviſable to venture a battle in the very beginning of his reign, with a formidable enemy, who promiſed himſelf great ſucceſs from the death of Æneas, he had the prudence to confine himſelf within the walls of Lavinium, and to try whether he could, by an honourable treaty, put an end to ſo dangerous a war. But the haughty Mezentius demanding of the Latins, as one of the conditions of a peace, that they ſhould pay him yearly, by way of tribute, all the wine produced in the territory of Latium, Aſcanius rejected the propoſal with the utmoſh indignation ; and having cauſed all the vines throughout his dominions to be conſecrated to Jupiter, and by that means put it out of his power to comply with the enemy’s requeſt, he reſolved to make a vigorous fally, and try whether he could, by force of arms, bring the inſulting Tyrrhenian to more reaſonable terms. The main body of the enemy’s army was encamped at ſome diſtance from Lavinium ; but Lauſus, the ſon of Mezentius, with, the flower of their youth under his command, lay entrenched at the very gates of the city. The Trojans, who had been long accuſtomed to make vigorous ſallies, marching out in the night, attacked the poſt where Lauſus commanded, forced his entrenchments, and obliged the troops he had with him to ſave. themſelves by flying to the main body of the army encamped on the plain ; but the unexpected arrival and·</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
