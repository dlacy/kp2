among the Jews, was a place where people met to worſhip God. Authors are not agreed about the time when the Jews firſt began to have ſynagogues : — Some will have them as old as the Ceremonial Law, and others fix their beginning to the times after the Babyloniſh captivity. They erected ſynagogues not only in towns and cities, but alſo in the country, eſpecially near rivers, that they might have water for their purifications and ceremonious washings. No ſynagogue was built in any town, unleſs there were ten perſons of leiſure in it ; but there might be many in one town, or in one quarter of a town, provided it was very populous. Jeruſalem is ſaid to have contained 480. The chief things belonging to a ſynagogue were, 1. The ark or cheſt, made after the model of the ark of the covenant, containing the <hi rend="italic">Pentateuch.</hi> 2. The pulpit and deſk in the middle or the ſynagogue, in which he that was to read or expound the law stood. 3. The ſeats or pews for the people. 4. The lamps to give light at evening ſervice, and the feaſt of dedication. 5. Rooms or apartments for the utensils and alms cheſts. The ſynagogue was governed by a council or assembly, over whom was a preſident, called <hi rend="italic">The Ruler of the Synagogue.</hi> Theſe are ſometimes called <hi rend="italic">Chiefs of the Jews, The Rulers, The Priests</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Elders, The Governors, The Overseers, The Fathers of the Synagogue.</hi> Their buſineſs was to puniſh the diſobedient by cenſures, by excommunication, or by penalties, ſuch as fines and ſcourging ; to take care of the alms, which are frequently called by the name of righteouſneſs. The chief ruler, or one of the rulers, gave leave to have the law read and expounded, and appointed who ſhould do it. In every ſynagogue, there were ſeveral mimſters who had different offices aſſigned to them. Service was performed three times a day, viz. in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night ; at the time of morning ſacrifice, evening ſacrifice, and after the evening ſacrifice on Mondays, Thurſdays and Saturdays, there was a more forcible obligation upon the people to attend than upon the other days. There are ſynagogues at London, Amſterdam, Rotterdam, Avignon, Metz, &amp;c.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
