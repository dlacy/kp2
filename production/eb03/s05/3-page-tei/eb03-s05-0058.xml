Curule ſtatues, are thoſe which are repreſented in chariots drawn by bigæ or quadrigæ, that is, by two or four horſes ; of which kind there were ſeveral in the circules, hippodromes, &amp;c. or in cars, as we see ſome, with triumphal arches on antique medals. 3. Equeſtrian ſtatue, that which repreſents ſome illustrious perſon on horſeback, as that famous one of Marcus Aurelius at Rome ; that of king Charles I. at Charing-croſs ; King George II in Leicester-Square, &amp;c. 4. Greek statue, denotes a figure that is naked and antique ; it being in this manner the Greeks repreſented their deities, athletæ of the Olympic games, and heroes ; the statues of heroes were particularly called <hi rend="italic">Achillean statues,</hi> by reaſon of the great number of figures of Achilles in moſt of the cities of Greece. 5. Hydraulic statue, is any figure placed as an ornament of a fountain or grotto, or that does the office of a <hi rend="italic">jet d’eau,</hi> a cock, ſpout, or the like, by any of its parts, or by any attribute it holds : the like is to be underſtood of any animal ſerving for the ſame uſe. 6. Pedeſtrian ſtatue, a ſtatue standing on foot; as that of king Charles IL in the Royal Exchange, and of king James II. in the Privy- Gardens. 7. Roman ſtatue, is an appellation given to such as are clothed, and which receive various names from their various dreſſes. Thoſe of emperors, with long gowns over their armour, were called st<hi rend="italic">atuae paludata :</hi> thoſe of captains and cavaliers, with coats of arms, <hi rend="italic">thoracata ;</hi> thoſe of ſoldiers with cuirasses, <hi rend="italic">loricata ;</hi> thoſe of ſenators and augurs, <hi rend="italic">trabeata;</hi> thoſe of magiſtrates with long robes, <hi rend="italic">togata ;</hi> thoſe of the people with a plain tunica, <hi rend="italic">tumcatae ;</hi> and, laſtly, thoſe of women with long trains, st<hi rend="italic">olutae.</hi></p><p>In repairing a ſtatue caſt in a mould, they touch it up with a chiſel, graver, or other infiniment, to finiſh the places which have not come well off : they alſo clear off the barb, and what is redundant in the joints and projectures.</p><p>STATURE.

Thus we say, the ſteam of boiling water, of malt, of a tan-bed, &amp;c. It is distinguiſhed from smoke by its not having been produced by combuſtion, by not containing any soot, and by its being condenſible by cold into water, oil, inflammable ſpirits, or liquids compoſed of theſe.</p><p>We ſee it riſe in great abundance from bodies when they are heated, forming a white cloud, which diffuſes itſelf and diſappears at no very great diſtance from the body from which it was produced. In this cafe the ſurrounding air is found loaded with the water or other juices which seem to have produced it, and the steam ſeems to be completely soluble in air, as ſalt is in water, compoſing while thus united a transparent elaſtic fluid.</p><p>But in order to its appearance in the form of an opaque white cloud, the mixture with or disſemination in air ſeem abſolutely neceſſary. If a tea-kettle boils violently, ſo that the ſteam is formed at the ſpout in great abundance, it may be obſerved, that the viſible cloud is not formed at the very mouth of the ſpout, but at a ſmall diſtance before it, and that the vapour is perfectly tranſparent at its first emiſſion. This is rendered ſtill more evident by fitting to the ſpout of the tea-kettle a glaſs pipe of any length, and of as large a diameter as we please. The fleam is produced as copiouſly as without this pipe, but the vapour is tranſparent through the whole length of the pipe. Nay, if this pipe communicate with a glaſs velſel terminating in another pipe, and if the vesſel be kept ſufficiently hot, the ſteam will be as abundantly produced at the mouth of this second pipe as before, and the veſſel will be quite tranſparent. The viſibility therefore of the matter which constitutes the ſteam is an accidental or extraneous circumſtance, and requires the admixture with air ; yet this quality again leaves it when united with air by ſolution. It appears therefore to require a <hi rend="italic">diſſemination</hi> in the air. The appearances are quite agreeable to this notion : for we know that one perfectly tranſparent body, when minutely divided and diffused among the parts of another tranſparent body, but not diſſolved in it, makes a maſs which is viſible. Thus oil beat up with water makes a white opaque maſs.</p><p>In the mean time, as ſteam is produced, the water gradually waſtes in the tea kettle, and will ſoon be totally expended, if we continue it on the fire. It is reaſonable therefore to ſuppoſe, that this ſteam is nothing but water changed by heat into an aerial or elaſtic form. If ſo, we ſhould expect that the privation of this heat would leave it in the form of water again. Accordingly this is fully verified by experiment ; for if the pipe fitted to the ſpout oſ the tea-kettle be ſurrounded with cold water, no ſteam will issue, but water will continually trickle from it in drops ; and if the proceſs be conducted with the proper precautions, the water which we thus obtain from the pipe will be found</p></body></text></TEI>
