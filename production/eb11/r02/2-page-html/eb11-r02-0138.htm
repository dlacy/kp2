                less satisfactory, for short diagnoses. America alone combines Iguanidae and
                Tejidae:—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">N. America: Iguanidae, Anguidae, Tejidae (and Rhineura in

        <p><span class="font1">S. America: Iguanidae, Anguidae, Tejidae and many
                Amphis-baenidae.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Africa and Madagascar: Chameleons and Zonuridae and

        <p><span class="font1">India : Varanidae, Agamidae and Lacertidae, all of which also in
                Africa.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Australia alone has Pygopodidae.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Lacertilia are now distributed upon principles very different
                from those of the tortoises. According to the lizards the world is&nbsp;divided into
                an E. and a W. half. The W. alone has Iguanidae&nbsp;and Tejidae<sub>1</sub> the E.
                alone that important combination of Varanidae&nbsp;and Agamidae. Further subdivision
                is in most cases possible only&nbsp;by exclusion, </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> exclusion of Lacertilia
                and chameleons , from&nbsp;Australia; of Varanidae and. Agamidae from Madagascar.
                Lizards&nbsp;are rather susceptible to climatic conditions, iniinitely more
                than&nbsp;water tortoises.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As regards </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Ophidia,</span><span class="font1"> America has Crotalinae and Elapinae, but no
                Viperinae. Eurasia and India alone combines Viperinae, Crotalinae&nbsp;and Elapinae.
                Africa, Viperinae and Elapinae but no Crotalinae.&nbsp;Australia only EUpinae.
                Madagascar none, of these groups.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Viperinae must have had their original centre in the palaearctic
                countries, and they have been debarred only from Australia and Madagascar. Both
                vipers and pit vipers , are still in Asia,&nbsp;but true vipers are absent in
                America, with their fullest development now in Africa, whilst pit vipers went E.,
                covering now the&nbsp;whole of America, and having developed the rattlesnakes in
                Sonora-land. The Elapinae are undoubtedly of Asiatic origin; they have&nbsp;overrun
                Africa, were too late for Madagascar, but early enough for&nbsp;Australia, where
                they are only poisonous, snakes; and only one&nbsp;genus, </span><span class="font1"

                rather, has differentiated in America,&nbsp;in the S. of which it is
                abundant.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Opisthoglypha are useless for our purpose; they are cosmopolitan,
                with the exception of Australia but probably they have one&nbsp;ancient centre in S.
                America, and another in the old world.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Amblycephalidae afford another of those curious instances of apparent
                affinity between S.E. Asia anti Centnd America; paralleled by </span><span

                which ranges from Madagascar to Panama,&nbsp;while all the other Hydrophinae belong
                to the Indian Ocean and&nbsp;the E. Asiatic seas. Aglyphous Colubrines show
                undoubted&nbsp;affinity between N.. America and Eurasia; the whole group
                is&nbsp;absolutely cosmopolitan, and many of the genera, </span><span class="font1"

                class="font1"> have proved their success by having&nbsp;acquired an enormous range.
                Snakes have comparatively few&nbsp;enemies, and they possess exceptional means of
                distribution. It&nbsp;is rare for a terrestrial species to have such a wide range as

        <p><span class="font1">The tortoises divide the habitable world into a S. and a N. world,
                much as do the anurous Batrachians; the lizards split it into an&nbsp;E. and a W.
                hemisphere. The poisonous snakes, the most recent&nbsp;of reptiles in their full
                development and distribution, allow us to&nbsp;distinguish between Australia,

        <p><span class="font2">REPTON, a village in the S. parliamentary division of Derbyshire,
                England, 8 m. S.W. of Derby, on the Midland railway. Pop. (1901) 1695. Jt is famous
                for its school, founded in 1557&nbsp;by Sir John Port, of the neighbouring village
                of Etwall, which has&nbsp;valuable entrance scholarships, and two leaving
                exhibitions to&nbsp;the universities annually. The number of boys is about
                300.&nbsp;The school buildings are modem, but incorporate considerable&nbsp;portions
                of an Augustinian priory established in 1172. There was&nbsp;an ecclesiastical
                establishment on this site in the 7th century,&nbsp;the first bishop of Mercia being
                established here. This was&nbsp;destroyed by the Danes in 874. In the second half of
                the 10th&nbsp;century, during the reign of Edgar, another church was
                founded.&nbsp;The existing parish church of St Wystan retains pre-Conquest&nbsp;work
                in the chancel, beneath which is a remarkably fine vaulted&nbsp;crypt, probably
                dating from the reign of Edgar, its roof supported on fluted columns. The monastery
                was dissolved by&nbsp;Henry VIH.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">REPUBLIC (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >respublica,</span><span class="font2"> a commonweal or commonwealth), a term now
                universally understood to mean a state, or polity, in which the head of the
                government is elective, and&nbsp;in which those things which are the interest of all
                are decided&nbsp;upon by all. This is notoriously a very modem
                interpretation&nbsp;of the term. In the ancient world of Greece and Rome
                the&nbsp;franchise was in the hands of a minority, who were surrounded&nbsp;by, and
                who governed, a majority composed of men personally&nbsp;free but not possessed of
                the franchise, and of slaves. Modem&nbsp;writers have often used </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">respublica,</span><span class="font2"> and
                literal translation, as&nbsp;meaning only the state, even when the head was an
                absolute&nbsp;king, provided that he held his place according to law and
                ruled&nbsp;by law. “ Republic,” to quote one example only of many, was&nbsp;so used
                by Jean Bodin, whose treatise, commonly known by its&nbsp;Latin name </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Republica Libri Sex,</span><span
                class="font2"> first appeared in French&nbsp;in 1577. Englishmen of the middle ages
                habitually spoke of&nbsp;the commonwealth of England, though they had no
                conception&nbsp;that they could be governed except by a king with
                hereditary&nbsp;right. The coins of Napoleon bear the inscription </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">"République française, Napoléon
                Empereur.”</span><span class="font2"> Except as an arbitrary term&nbsp;of art, or as
                a rhetorical expression, “ republic ” has, however,&nbsp;always been understood to
                mean a state in which the head&nbsp;holds his place by the choice of his subjects.
                Poland was&nbsp;a republic because its king had in earlier times to be
                accepted,&nbsp;and in later times was chosen by a democracy composed of&nbsp;gentry.
                Venice was a republic, though after The “closing of&nbsp;the great council ” the
                franchise was confined to a strictly&nbsp;limited aristocracy, which was itself in
                practice dominated by a&nbsp;small oligarchy. The seven states which formed the
                confederation&nbsp;of the United Netherlands were republics from the time
                they&nbsp;renounced their allegiance to Philip II., though they chose to
                be&nbsp;governed by a stadtholder to whom they delegated large powers,&nbsp;and
                though the choice of the stadtholder was made by a small&nbsp;body of burghers who
                alone had the franchise. The varieties&nbsp;are many. What, however, is emphatically
                not a republic is a&nbsp;state in which the ruler can truly tell his subjects that,
                the&nbsp;sovereignty resides in his royal person, and that he is king, or&nbsp;tsar,
                “ pure and absolute,” by the grace of God, even though he&nbsp;may hasten to add
                that “ absolute ” is not “ despotic,” which&nbsp;means government without regard to
                law. The case of Great&nbsp;Britain, where the king reigns theoretically by the
                grace of God,&nbsp;but in fact by a parliamentary title and under the Act of
                Settlement, is, like the whole British constitution, unique.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">There is in fact a fundamental incompatibility between the
                conceptions of government as a commonwealth and as an&nbsp;institution based on a
                right superior to the people’s will. Where&nbsp;the two views endeavour to live
                together one of two things must&nbsp;happen. The ruler will confiscate the rights of
                the community&nbsp;to himself and will become the embodiment of
                sovereignty,&nbsp;which is what happened in most of the states of Europe at
                the&nbsp;close of the middle ages; or the community, acting through&nbsp;some body
                politic which is its virtual representative, will&nbsp;confine the head of the
                government to defined functions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The question of representation is dealt with separately (see
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Representation),</span><span class="font2"> but the conception of a republic
                in&nbsp;which all males, who do not belong to an inferior and&nbsp;barbarous race,
                share in the suffrage is one which would&nbsp;never have been accepted in the
                ancient or medieval world,&nbsp;for it is based on a foundation of which they knew
                nothing,&nbsp;—the political rights of man. When the Scottish reformer&nbsp;John
                Knox based his claim to speak on the government of&nbsp;the realm on the fact that
                he was “ a subject born within the&nbsp;same” he advanced a pretension very new to
                his generation.&nbsp;But it was one which was fated to achieve a great fortune.
                The&nbsp;right of the subject, simply as a member of the community,, to a&nbsp;voice
                in the community in which he was born, and on which his&nbsp;happiness depended,
                implied all “ the rights of man ” as they&nbsp;were to be stated by the American
                Declaration of Independence,&nbsp;and again by the French in 1789. As they could be
                vindicated&nbsp;only by revolt against monarchical governments in the old&nbsp;world
                and the new, and as they were incompatible with all the&nbsp;convictions which make
                monarchy possible, they embodied</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"
