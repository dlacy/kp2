Some have thought that this was the tower of Babel. She made warlike expeditions against the Medes, Persians, Libyans, and Æthiopians. She is said to have executed many wonderful works in different parts of her kingdom; changing mountains into plains, and constructing canals and palaces. Hearing of the riches and power of India, she determined to make war on that kingdom, and prepared an immense army ; but she was in a great measure unsuccessful, and returned with the loss of nearly her whole army. When she reached Babylon, her son laid snares for her; and as it had been predicted by the oracle of Jupiter Ammon that she would disappear from the world when this took place, the prediction was fulfilled. Semiramis was no more seen, having died in the sixty-second year of her age, and the forty-second of her reign.</p><p>SEMITONE. See Mustc.</p><p>SEMLIN, a city of the Austrian dominions, on the frontier towards Turkey. It stands in that district which forms a part of the military colonies of Austria, distinguished by the name of the Sclavonian boundary. It is situated on a point of land where the river Drave falls into the Danube ; and it is strongly fortified, and tolerably well built. The Catholics have one church and four chapels; the Greeks have two churches, over which a propapa presides. There are a convent of Franciscans, a German normal sch∞l, a hospital, a Jews’ synagogue, and 1250 dwelling-houses, with about 8700 inhabitants. At this place is the lazaretto, where all persons arriving from Turkey must exhibit bills of health, and perform quarantine. In a meadow between this place and Belgrade a daily market is held, where two rows of palisades separate the dealers, and where sentinels are continually on the watch, to see that no hazardous communication takes place; and all goods bought from the Turks must be exposed to the air and fumigated. It is a place of considerable traffic with Turkey. The communication by steam-vessels between Vienna and Constantinople has given a stimulus to its commerce, and is likely to occasion a much greater increase. There are now more than 120 mercantile houses established here, some of which are Greek, others Turkish, and a part Austrian. There are 380 persons employed in manufactures, and more than 100 hotels or taverns. The colonists regimented here form the Pe- terwarden branch of the army. Long. 20. 19. 39. E. Lat. 44. 51. 22.

It is divided into six cantons, and these into 145 communes, with a population, in 1836, of 70,505 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, standing on a rock washed on three sides by the river Armançon. It contains a fine collegiate church, built in 1065, a public library with 12,000 volumes, and 920 houses, with 4035 inhabitants, who make some woollen goods, and trade largely in wine, cattle, corn, and hemp.

It was taken by the Mahommedans in the year 1662.</p><p>SENAN-FOU, a city of China, of the first rank, in the province of Koeitchoo, situated on a fine river, in an extensive plain, surrounded on all sides by mountains, among which dwell a barbarous race, who have little intercourse with the Chinese.

N.</p><p>SENATE, in general, is an assembly or council of senators, that is, of the principal inhabitants of a state, who have a share in the government.</p><p>The senate of ancient Rome is of all others the most celebrated. It exercised no contentious jurisdiction, but appointed judges, either from among the senators or knights, to determine processes. It also appointed governors of pro</p><p>vinces, and disposed of the revenues of the commonwealth. Yet the whole sovereign power did not reside in the senate, since it could not elect magistrates, make laws, or decide of war and peace ; for, in all these cases, the senate was obliged to consult the people.</p><p>The senate, when first instituted by Romulus, consisted of a hundred members ; to whom he afterwards added the same number when the Sabines had migrated to Rome. Tarquin the ancient made the senate consist of three hundred, and this number remained fixed for a long time ; but afterwards it fluctuated greatly, and was increased, first to seven hundred, and afterwards to nine hundred, by Julius Cæsar, who filled the senate with men of every rank and order. Under Augustus the senators amounted to a thousand; but this number was reduced, and fixed at six hundred. The place of senator was always bestowed upon merit. The monarchs had the privilege of choosing the members ; and after the expulsion of the Tarquins, it was one of the rights of the consuls, until the election of the censors, who from their office seemed most capable of making choice of men whose character was irreproachable, whose morals were pure, and whose relations were honourable. Only particular families were admittcd into the senate ; and when the plebeians were permitted to share the honours of the state, it was then required that they should be born of free citizens. It was also required that the candidates should be knights before their admission into the senate. They were to be above the age of twenty-five, and to have previously passed through the inferior offices of quæstor, tribune of the people, edile, prætor, and consul.</p><p>The senate always met on the first of January for the inauguration of the new consuls ; and in all months, universally, there were three days, the kalends, nones, and ides, on which it regularly met. But it always met on extraordinary occasions, when called together by consul, tribune, or dictator.</p><p>To render their decrees valid and authentic, a certain number of members was requisite, and such as were absent without some proper cause were always fined. In the reign of Augustus, four hundred senators were requisite to make a senate. Nothing was transacted before sunrise or after sunset. In their office the senators were the guardians of religion ; they disposed of the provinces as they pleased ; they prorogued the assemblies of the people ; they appointed thanksgivings, nominated their ambassadors, and distributed the public money ; and, in short, they had the management of every thing political or civil in the republic, except the creating of magistrates, the enacting of laws, and the declaration of war or peace, which were confined to the assemblies of the people.</p><p>SENATOR, in general, denotes a member of some senate.</p><p>The dignity of a Roman senator could not be supported without the possession of eighty thousand sesterces, or about L.7000 English money ; and therefore such as squandered away their money, and reduced their fortune below this sum, were generally struck out of the list of senators. This regulation was not made in the first ages of the republic, when the Romans boasted of their poverty. The senators were not permitted to be of any trade or profession. They were distinguished from the rest of the people by their dress. They wore the laticlave, half-boots of a black colour, with a crescent or silver buckle in the form of a C ; but this lost honour was confined only to the descendants of those hundred senators who had been elected by Romulus, as the letter C seems to imply.</p><p>Among us, senator is a member of parliament. In the laws of Edward the Confessor, we are told that the Britons called those senators whom the Saxons called afterwards aldermen and borough-masters, though not on account of their age, but their wisdom ; for some of them were young</p></body></text></TEI>
