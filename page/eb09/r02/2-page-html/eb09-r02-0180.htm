<p><span class="font2">Along the north and west coast there are on the reef a number of islands of volcanic origin ; those on the southeast are all of coralline limestone or sand. There are only&nbsp;two passages through the reef available for large vessels,&nbsp;—these leading respectively to Port Mathurin and to Port&nbsp;South-East. Rodriguez is comparatively arid; and the&nbsp;streams are as short-lived for the most part as they are&nbsp;beautiful. The climate is like that of Mauritius, but&nbsp;more subject to hurricanes during the north-west monsoon&nbsp;(November to April).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About 1845 the population of Rodriguez was about 250 persons. The original nucleus consisted of slaves from&nbsp;Mauritius, and recruits arrived from Madagascar and the&nbsp;African continent. By 1871 they had increased to 1108&nbsp;and by 1881 to 1436. The island is governed by a civil&nbsp;commissioner, who is also a police magistrate. Capitalists&nbsp;from Mauritius are beginning to pay attention to the&nbsp;natural advantages of the island. A carriage road has&nbsp;been constructed from Mathurin to Gabriel, the only other&nbsp;village, where the Roman Catholic priests have their&nbsp;chapel and residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When originally discovered and down into the 17th century Rodriguez was clothed with fine timber trees ; but goats, cattle,&nbsp;and bush-fires have combined to destroy the great bulk of the old&nbsp;vegetation, and the indigenous plants have in many cases been&nbsp;ousted by intrusive foreigners. When the island was in French&nbsp;possession many settlers cultivated large estates, and fortunes were&nbsp;realized ; but with the liberation of the slaves the area of cultivation decreased, and it is now of very limited extent. The staple&nbsp;crop is the sweet potato ; and manioc, maize, millet, and rice grow&nbsp;well, but are not much cultivated. Wheat is seldom seen, mainly&nbsp;because of the parakeets and the Java sparrows. Beans </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Fhaseolus&nbsp;lunatus'),</span><span class="font1"> lentils, gram (C⅛cer «rieiinwn),dholl </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cajaηus indicus),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;ground-nuts are all grown to a certain extent in spite of the ravages&nbsp;of the rats (Balfour). Mangoes, bananas, guavas, pine-apples, custard-apples, and especially oranges, citrons, and limes, are the fruits that&nbsp;flourish best. Of the timber trees the most common are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elæoden-dron orientale,</span><span class="font1"> much used in carpentry and for pirogues, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Latania&nbsp;Verschaffelti</span><span class="font1"> (Leguat’s plantane). At least two species of screw-pine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Paηdanus heteroearpus,</span><span class="font1"> Balf. fil. and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ρ. teηuifolius)</span><span class="font1"> occur&nbsp;freely throughout the island. The total number of known species,&nbsp;according to Professor I. B. Balfour, is 470, belonging to 8δ families&nbsp;and 293 genera ; and of these 297 are phanerogamous and 173&nbsp;cryptogamous. The families represented by the greatest number of&nbsp;species are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gramineæ {21</span><span class="font1"> indigenous, 6 introduced), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leguminosæ</span><span class="font1"> (14&nbsp;ind., 15 intr.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Convolvulaeeæ</span><span class="font1"> (11 ind., 4 intr.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Malveœeæ</span><span class="font1"> (9 ind.),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rubiaceæ</span><span class="font1"> (8 ind.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cyperaceæ</span><span class="font1"> (8 ind.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Euphorbiaceæ</span><span class="font1"> (8 ind.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liliaeeæ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(6 ind. ), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Compositæ</span><span class="font1"> (5 ind., 6 intr. ). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Μathurina pcndulifiora ( Tur-neraceæ}</span><span class="font1"> is interesting, as its nearest congener is in Central America,&nbsp;and the family has not hitherto been found in the Mascarenes. Of&nbsp;33 species of mosses 17 are peculiar. Variability of species and&nbsp;heterophylly are characteristic of the flora to quite an unusual&nbsp;degree. To the naturalist Rodriguez is as interesting as it is to&nbsp;the botanist. At present the only indigenous mammal is a species&nbsp;of fruit-eating bat </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pteropus rodericensis'),</span><span class="font1"> and the introduced species&nbsp;are such familiar creatures as the pig, rabbit, rat, mouse, &amp;c. ; but&nbsp;down to a recent period the island was the home of a very large&nbsp;land-tortoise ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo Vοsmaeri</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rodericensis),</span><span class="font1"> and its limestone&nbsp;caves have yielded a large number of skeletons of the dodo-like&nbsp;solitaire </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hezophaps solitaries),</span><span class="font1"> which still built its mound-like nest&nbsp;in the island in the close of the 17th century, but is now extinct&nbsp;(see vol. iii. p. 732). Of indigenous birds 13 species have been&nbsp;registered. The guinea-fowl (introduced) has become exceedingly&nbsp;abundant, partly owing to a protective game-law ; and a francolin&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{F. ponticerianus),</span><span class="font1"> popularly a “partridge,” is also common. The&nbsp;marine fish-fauna does not differ from that of Mauritius, and the&nbsp;freshwater species, with the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mugil rodericensis</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Myxus cæcuticus,</span><span class="font1"> are common to all the Mascarenes. Thirty-five&nbsp;species of crustaceans are known. The insects (probably very imperfectly registered) comprise 60 species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coleoptera,</span><span class="font1"> 15 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hymxno-ρtera,</span><span class="font1"> 21 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepidoptera,</span><span class="font1"> 15 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Orthoptera,</span><span class="font1"> and 20 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hemiptera.</span><span class="font1"> Forty-nine species of coral have been collected, showing a close affinity to&nbsp;those of Mauritius, Madagascar, and the Seychelles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rodriguez or Diego Ruy’s Island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1645. In 1690 Duquesne prevailed on the Dutch Government to send a body of French refugees to the Island of Bourbon, at that time, he believed, abandoned by the French authorities.&nbsp;As the refugees, however, found the French in possession they proceeded to Rodriguez, and there eight of their number were landed&nbsp;on 30th April 1691 with a promise that they should be visited by&nbsp;their compatriots within two years. The two years were spent&nbsp;without misadventure, but, instead of waiting for the arrival of their&nbsp;friends, the seven colonists (for one had meanwhile died) rashly&nbsp;left the island on 8th May 1693 and made their way to Mauritius,&nbsp;where they were treated with great cruelty by the governor. The&nbsp;account of the enterprise left us by Francis Leguat—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages et&nbsp;Aventures</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1708), or, as it is called in the English translation, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A New Voyage to the East Indies</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1708)—is a most&nbsp;garrulous and amusing narrative, and was for a long time almost&nbsp;the only source of information about Rodriguez. His description&nbsp;of the solitaire is of course unique.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROE or Row, Sir Thomas (1568 7-1644), an eminent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">political agent of the reigns of James I. and Charles I., was born in 1568 (?) at Low Leyton near Wanstead in&nbsp;Essex (being a grandson of Sir Thomas Roe, a well-known&nbsp;lord mayor of London). He was entered as a commoner&nbsp;at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1593, but shortly afterwards he left the university and, having read for the bar,&nbsp;became esquire of the body to Queen Elizabeth. From&nbsp;James I. he received the honour of knighthood in 1604,&nbsp;and in 1609 he was sent by Prince Henry on a mission to&nbsp;the West Indies, during which he visited Guiana and the&nbsp;river Amazons. As member of parliament in 1614 he&nbsp;supported the principles of Sandys and Whitelocke. His&nbsp;permanent reputation was mainly secured by the success&nbsp;which attended his embassy in 1615-18 to the court at&nbsp;Agra of the Great Mogul (Jahangir, son of Akbar), whose&nbsp;importance had been made known by Sir John Hawkins,&nbsp;—the principal object of the mission being to obtain the&nbsp;protection of an English factory at Surat. Sir Thomas&nbsp;Roe’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font2"> reprinted in a more or less complete shape&nbsp;in the collections of Purchas, Pinkerton, and Kerr, forms&nbsp;one of the leading authorities for the reign of Jahangir.&nbsp;Appointed ambassador to the Porte in 1621, he filled this&nbsp;difficult position under Osman, Mustapha, and Amurat ;&nbsp;and after his return from the East he continued to be employed on various political missions to Poland, Denmark,&nbsp;and other European courts, till in 1641 he was sent by&nbsp;Charles I. to the diet of Ratisbon. Roe died in 1644.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society for the Encouragement of Learning proposed to publish a whole series of Roe’s papers, but owing to lack of funds only one of the five volumes, edited by Samuel Richardson, ever saw the&nbsp;light—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Negotiations of Sir Thomas Roe in his Embassy to the&nbsp;Ottoman Forte, 1621-1628</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1740).

<p><span class="font2">ROEBLING, John Augustus (1806-1869), civil engineer, was born at Mühlhausen, Prussia, 6th June 1806. Soon after his graduation from the polytechnic school at&nbsp;Berlin he removed to the United States, and in 1831&nbsp;entered on the practice of his profession in western Pennsylvania. He established at Pittsburgh a manufactory of&nbsp;wire rope, and in May 1845 completed his first important&nbsp;structure, the suspended aqueduct of the Pennsylvania&nbsp;Canal across the Monongahela river. This was followed&nbsp;by the Monongahela suspension bridge at Pittsburgh and&nbsp;several suspended aqueducts on the Delaware and Hudson&nbsp;Canal. Removing his wire manufactory to Trenton, New&nbsp;Jersey, he began, in 1851, the erection at Niagara Falls of&nbsp;a long span wire suspension bridge with double roadway,&nbsp;for railway and carriage use (see Bridge, vol. iv. pp.&nbsp;338-339), which was completed in 1855. Owing to the&nbsp;novelty of its design, the most eminent engineers, including&nbsp;Stevenson, regarded this bridge as foredoomed to failure ;&nbsp;but, with its complete success, demonstrated by long use,&nbsp;the number of suspension bridges rapidly multiplied, the&nbsp;use of wire-ropes instead of chain-cables becoming all but&nbsp;universal.
