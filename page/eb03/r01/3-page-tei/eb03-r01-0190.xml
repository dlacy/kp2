His character, it may well be imagined, was extremely unpopular ; for he is ſaid to have aſſerted, that he would " make the people of Paris eat hay.” He had retired to the country, but was ſeized by his ■ own vaſſals, and brought to Paris with a bundle of hay <hi rend="sup">:</hi>tied to his back. In ſpite of every effort made by Μ. M. Bailly and Fayette to procure him a fair trial at leaſt, .he was carried to the<hi rend="italic">Place de Gre*υe,</hi>  and hanged at a lamp-iron by the enraged multitude. His ſon-ſh-law M. Berthier, attempting to defend himſelf againſt a ſimilar fate, fell, covered with wounds. Their heads were carried round on poles ; and thus the populace became habituated to the fight of blood and murder : they were even taught by popular ſongs to glory in ſuch actions, and particularly by the well known ſong <hi rend="italic">Ca-ira.</hi></p><p>In conſequence of an invitation from the king, M. Neckar returned to France. He was received by the aſſembly with great applauſe, and in Paris with infinite ſolemnity and triumph. He here, however, committed a political error that made ſome noiſe. In deploring the late exceſſes and murders, and taking notice of the arrcſt of M. Bezenval, an officer of the Swiſs guards, he requeſted of the electors at the Hotel de villc, in a ſolemn harangue, that the paſt ſhould be for-gotten ; that proſcriptions ſhould ceaſe, and a general amneſty be proclaimed. In a moment of enthuſiaſm this was agreed to, and the electors decreed what un-queſtionably exceeded their powers. The diſtricts of Paris were inſtantly in commotion ; the electors alarmed, declared that they only meant that " henceforth the people would puniſh no man but according to law and, at the ſame time, to prove that they themſelves were free from ambition, they formally renounced all their own powers. The aſſembly took up the que-ſtion. Meſſ. Lally, Tolendal, Mounier, Clermont, Tonnerre, Garat junior, and others, declared that no perſon ought to be arreſted without a formal accuſation. while Meſſ. Mirabcau, Robeſpierre, Barnave, and Gleizen, alleged, on the contrary, that the people were entitled to lay hold of any man who had public-ly appeared at the head of their enemies. The debate ended, by admitting the explanation of the electors, and by a declaration that it was the duty of the aſſern-bly to fee juſtice executed in all cafes.</p><p>The commotions and enthuſiaſm of the capital were fpeedily communicated to the provinces. In every quarter the people ſeized upon all the arms that could be found, and the military uniformly refuſed to act againſt them. Many acts of outrage were committed in Brittany, at Straſhourg, in the Lionnois, and elfe-where, in which the nobility were the ſuſſerers. The miſchiefs that occurred were ufually magnified at a diſtance ; but that very circumſtance wa6 an additional evil. For example : It was ſtated in the National Affembly that M. de Meſmay, lord of Quincey, invited a number of patriots, among whom were the officers of a neighbouring garrifon, to a fplendid entertainment at his houſe, to celebrate the happy union of the three orders : That in the midſt of the feaſt the maſter of the houſe contrived to withdraw unnoticed, and to ſet fire to a train previouſly laid, which communicated with a quantity of gunpowder in the cellars, in conſequence of which the whole company, by a ſudden exp!ofion, were blown into the air. It w.as found on inquiry, that there was not one word of truth in the whole ſtory. But before this inquiry could be made, all France had reſounded with accounts of the pretended bloody tragedy; and the whole nobility of the kingdom ſuffer-ed in a leſs or greater degree, from the prejudices ex-cited by this unhappy report, the origin of which has never bcen well explained. It would be vain to ſtate all the idle rumours to which at this time the blind credu-lity of the multitude gave currency. At one time, the Ariſtocrates were cutting down the green corn, at an-other time they were burying flour in common ſewers, or caſting loaves into the Seine. One report was no ſooner proved to be falſe than another aroſe, and the whole nation was agitated by ſuſpicion and alarm. The National Aſſembly were engaged in framing their cele-brated declaration of the rights of man, which was to form the baſis of die new conſtitution, when the alarming accounts, received from all quarters, of the ſtate of anarchy into which the kingdom was falling, obliged them ſuddenly to turn their attention to objects of practical neceſlity. The privileged orders found them-ſelves become the objects of univerſal jealoufy and hatred; and that ſomething muſt inſtantly be done to fave their families and property, which were menaced on every ſide with pcrſecution and pillage. Regarding the popular torrent as now become irreſiſtible, to ſave ſomething they reſolved to ſacrifice a part.</p><p>Οη the afternoon fitting of the 4th of Auguſt, the viſcount de Noailles, ſeconded by the Duke d’Aguil-lon, opened one of the moſt important ſcenes in the French Revolution, or in the hiſtory of any conntry. Theſe noblemen ſtated, that the true cauſe of the corn-motions which convulſed the kingdom exiſted in the mi-ſery of the people, who groaned under the double op-preſſion of public contributions and of feudal ſerviqes. “ For three months (ſaid M. de Noailles) the people have beheld us engaged in verbal diſputes, while their own attention and their wiſhes are directed only to things, what is the conſequence ? They are armed to reclaim their rights, and they fee no proſpect of obtaining them but by force.” He therefore propoſed to do juſtice as the ſhorteſt way of reſtoring tranquillity, and for that purpoſe to decree, that henceforth every tax ſhould be impoſed in proportion to the wealth of the contributors, and that no order of the ſtate ſhould be exempted from thc payment of public burdens ; that feudal claims ſhould be redeemed at a fair valuation ; but that ſuch claims as conſiſted of perſonal ſervices on the part of the vaſſal ſhould be aboliſhed without com-penſation, as contrary to the impreſcriptible rights of man. The extenſive poſſeffions of the noblemen who made theſe propoſals added much luſtre to the diſinte-reſted facrifice which they offered. Their fpeeches were received with the moſt enthuſiaſtic applauſes by the Aſſembly and the galleries, and their propoſals were decreed by acclamation without a vote. No nation is ſo much led by the influence of ſudden emotions as the French. The patriotic contagion now ſpread faſt through eveιy breaſt, and a conteſt of generoſity enſued. The hereditary juriſdictions poſſeſſed by the nobles within their own territories were next ſacvificed. All places and penſions granted by the Court were fup-preſled, unleſs granted as the reward of merit or of actual ſervices.
