It is eaſy to perceive that it contains the whole theory of the conſtruction of arches ; for each ſtont of an arch may be conſidered as one of the rafters of this piece of carpentry, ſince all is kept up by its mere equilibrium. We may have an opportunity in ſome future article of exhibiting ſome very elegant and ſimple ſolutions of the moſt difficult cafes of this important problem ; and we now proceed to make uſe of the knowledge we have acquired for the conſtruc</p><p>tion of roofs.</p><p>We mentioned by the bye a problem which is not unfrequent in practice, to determine the beſt form of a kirb-roof. Mr Couplet of the Royal Academy of Paris has given a ſolution of it in an elaborate memoir in 1726, occupying ſeveral lemmas and theorems.</p><p>Let AE (fig. ιι.) be the width, and CF the height; it is required to conſtruct a roof ABCDE whoſe rafters AB, BC, CD, DÉ, are all equal, and which ſhall be in equilibrio.</p><p>D raw CE, and biſect it perpendicularly in H by the line DHG, cutting the horizontal line AE in G. A-bout the centre G, with the diſtance GE, deſcribe the circle EDC. It muſt paſs through C, becauſe CH is equal to HE and the angles at H are equal. Draw HK parallel to FE, cutting the circumference in K. Draw CK, cutting GH in D. Join CD, ED ; theſe lines are the rafters of half of the roof required.·</p><p>' We prove this by ſhowing, that the loads in the angles C and D are equal. For this is the proportion which reſults from the equality of the rafters, and the extent of ſurſece of the uniform roofing which they are ſuppoſed to ſupport. Therefore produce ED till it •meet the vertical FC in N ; and having made the fide CBA ſimilar to CDE, complete the parallelogram BCDP, and draw DB, which will biſect CP in R, as the horizontal line K H, biſects CF in Draw KF, which is evidently parallel to DP. Make CS perpendicular to CF, and equal to FG; and about S, with the radius SF, deſcribe the circle FKW. It muſtpaſs through K, becauſe SF is equal to C G, and C Qj= OF. Draw W K, W S, and produce B C, cutting ND in O.</p><p>The angle WKF at the circumference is one-half of the angle W S F at the centre, and is therefore equal to WSC, or CGF. It is therefore double of the angle CEF or ECS. But ECS is equal to ECD and DCS, and ECD is one-half of NDC, and DCS is one-half of DCO, or C D P. Therefore the angle W K F is equal to NDP, and WK is parallel to ND, and CF is to CW as CP to CN ; and CN is equal to CP. But it has been ſhown above, that C N and C P are as the loads upon D and C. Theſe are therefore equal, and the frame ABCDE is in equilibrio,</p><p>A companion of this ſolution with that of Mr Couplet will ſliow its great advantage in reſpect of ſimplicity and perſpicuity. And the intelligent reader can eaſily adapt the conſtruction to any proportion between the rafters A B and B C, which other circumſtances, ſuch as garret-room, &amp;c. may<hi rend="sup">r</hi> render convenient. The conſtruction muſt be ſucli that NC may be to CP as CD to CD+DE.</p><p>Whatever proportion of AB to BC is</p><p>aſſumed, the point D'will be found in the circumference of a ſemicircle H' D' Z∣', whoſe centre is in the line C E, and having A B : B C = C H' : H E , = <hi rend="italic">cP ; h'</hi>  E. — The reſt of the conſtruction is ſimple,</p><p>In buildings which are rooſed with ſlate, tyle, or ſhingles, the circumſtance which is moſt likely to limit the conſtruction is the ſlope of the upper rafters C B, CD. This muſt be ſuſſicient to prevent the penetration of rain, and the ſtripping by the winds. The only circumſtance left in our choice in this caſe is the pro* portion of the rafters AB and BC. Nothing is eaſier than making NC to CP in any delired proportion when the angle BCD is given.</p><p>We need not repeat that it is always a deſirable thing to form a truſs for a roof in ſuch a manner that it ſhall<hi rend="sup"> </hi>be in equilibrio. When this is done, the whole force of the ſtruts and braces which are added to it is employed in preſerving this form, and no part is expended in un∙ neceſſary ſtrains. For we muſt now obſerve, that the equilibrium of which we have been treating is always of that kind which we called the tottering, and the roof requires ſtays, braces, or hanging timbers, to give it ſtiffneſs, or keep it in ſhape. We have alſo ſaid enough to enable any reader, acquainted with the moſt elementary geometry and mechanics, to compute the tranſverſe ſtrains and the thruſts to which the component parts of all roofs are expoſed.</p><p>It only remains now to ſhow the general maxims by which all roofs muſt be conſtructed, and the circumſtances which determine their excellence. In doing this we ſhall be exceedingly brief, and almoſt content our-ſelves with exhibiting the principal forms, of which the endleſs variety of roofs are only flight modifications.— We ſhall not trouble the reader with any account of ſuch roofs as receive part of their ſupport from the interior walls, but confine ourſelves to the more difficult problem of throwing a roof over a wide building, without any intermediate ſupport ; becauſe when ſuch roofs are conſtructed in the beſt manner, that is, deriving the greateſt poſſible ſtrength from the materials employed, the beſt conſtruction of the others is neceſſarily included. For all ſuch roofs as reſt on the middle walls are roofs of ſmaller bearing. The only exception deſerving notice is the roofs of churches, which have aiſles ſeparated from the nave by columns. The roof muſt rife on theſe. But if it is of an arched form internally, the horizontal thruſts muſt be nicely balanced, that they may not puſh the columns aſide.</p><p>The ſimpleſt notion of a roof-frame is, that it conſiſts of two rafters A B and B C (fig. 12.), meeting in the ridge B.</p><p>Even this ſimple form is ſuſceptible of better and</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
