But the cardinal and regent informed his ambaſſador, Sir Ralph Sadler, that from their own authority they could not command any of the nobles to be committted to him as hoſtages; and that the offenſive ſtrain of behaviour aſſumed by the Engliſh monarch might have altered the ſentiments of the Scottiſh parliament with regard to a meaſure of ſuch importance. After much altercation, the conferences were broken off; and as the lords who were releaſed from captivity had promiſed to return priſoners to England, it now remained with them to fulfil their promiſe. None of them, however, had the courage to do ſo, excepting the earl of Caſſils; and Henry, being ſtruck with his punctilious ſenſe of honour, diſmiſſed him loaded with preſents.</p><p>Cardinal Beaton being thus in poſſeſſion of power, took meaſures to ſecure it. The ſolemnity of the coronation of the young queen was celebrated at Stirling. A council was choſen to direct and aſſiſt the regent in the greater affairs of ſtate, at the head of which was the queen-dowager. John Hamilton, the abbot of Paiſley, who had acquired an aſcendency over the regent, was alſo promoted to the privy ſeal, and made treaſurer of the kingdom; and cardinal Beaton, upon the requeſt of the regent and the three eſtates, accepted the office of lord high chancellor.</p><p>After the flatteries and the hopes with which the earl of Lenox had been amuſed, the cardinal had reaſon to dread the utmoſt warmth of his reſentment. He had therefore written to Francis I. giving a detail oſ the critical ſituation of affairs in Scotland, and intreating him to recal to France the earl of Lenox, who was now intereſted to oppoſe the influence and operations of the queen-dowager. But the indignation with which the treachery of the cardinal had inflamed the earl of Lenox, precipitated him into immediate action, and defeated the intention of this artifice. In the hoſtile ſituation of his mind towards Scotland, an opportunity of commencing hoſtilitſes had preſented itſelf. Five ſhips had arrived in the Clyde from France, loaded with warlike flores, and having on board the patriarch of Venice, Peter Contareni, legate from Paul III. with La Broſſe, and James Meſnaige, ambaſſadors from France; and 30,000 crowns, which were to be employed in ſtrengthening the French faction, and to be diſtributed by the queen-dowager and the cardinal. Prevailing with the commanders of theſe veſſels, who conceived him to be the faſt friend of their monarch, he ſecured this money for his own uſe, and depoſited the military ſtores in his caſtle of Dumbarton, under the care of George Stirling the deputy-governor, who at this time was entirely in his intereſts.</p><p>By the ſuccessful application of this wealth, the earl of Lenox called forth the full exertion of his party in levying a formidable army, with which he threatened the deſtruction of the regent and the cardinal, offering them battle in the fields between Leith and Edinburgh. The regent, not being in a condition to accept the challenge of his rival, had recourſe to negociation. Cardinal Beaton and the earl of Huntley propoſed terms  of amity, and exerted themſelves with ſo much addreſs,  that the earl of Lenox, loſing the opportunity of chastiſing his enemies, conſented to an accommodation, and indulged anew the hope of obtaining the queen-</p><p>dowager in marriage. His army was dismissed, and he threw himſelf at the feet of his miſtreſs, by whom he was, in appearance, favourably received: but many of his friends were ſeduced from him under different pretences; and at laſt, apprehending his total ruin from ſome ſecret enterpriſe, he fled to Glaſgow, and fortified himſelf in that city. The regent, collecting an army, marched againſt him; and having defeated his friend the earl of Glencairn in a bloody encounter, was able to reduce the place of ſtrength in which he confided. In this ebb of his fortune, the earl of Lenox had no hope but from England.</p><p>The revolution produced in the political ſtate of Scotland by the arts of cardinal Beaton, while it defeated the intrigues of Henry VIII. pointed all its ſtrength againſt the progreſs of the reformation. After abandoning his old friends, the regent, in connection with the cardinal, was ambitious to undo all the ſervices he had rendered to them. The three eſtates annulled the treaties of amity and marriage, and empowered commiſſioners to conclude an alliance with France. The regent diſcharged the two preachers Guillame and Rough, whom he had invited to impugn the doctrines of the church. He drove back into England many pious perſons, whoſe zeal had brought them to Scotland, to explain and advance the new opinions. He careſſed with particular reſpect the legate whom the pope had ſent to diſcourage the marriage of the young queen with the prince of Wales, and to promiſe his aſſiſtance againſt the enterpriſes of Henry VIII. He procured an act of parliament to be paſſed for the persecution of heretics; and, upon the foundation of this authority, the moſt rigorous proceedings were concerted againſt the reformed; when the arms of England, rouſing the apprehenſions of the nation, gave the fulleſt employment to the regent and his counſellors.</p><p>In the rage and anguiſh of diſappointed ambition, the earl of Lenox made an offer to aſſiſt the views of the king of England; who, treating him as an ally, engaged, in the event of ſucceſs, to give him in marriage his niece the lady Margaret Douglas, and to inveſt him in the regency of Scotland. To eſtabliſh the reformation in Scotland, to acquire the ſuperiority over it to Henry VIII. and to effectuate the marriage of the prince of Wales with the queen of Scots, were the great objects of their confederacy.</p><p>Henry, though engaged in a war with France, which required all his military force, could not reſiſt the earlieſt opportunity in his power to execute his vengeance againſt Scotland. Edward Symour earl of Hartford was appointed to command 10,000 men; who were embarked at Tinmouth, aboard a fleet of 200 ſhips, under the direction of Sir John Dudley lord Liſle. This army was landed without oppoſition near Leith; and the earl of Hartford made it known to Sir Adam Otterburn, the provoſt of Edinburgh, that his commiſſion empowered him to lay the country waſte and deſolate, unleſs the regent ſhould deliver up the young queen to the king of England. It was anſwered, that every extremity oſ diſtreſs would be endured, before the Scottiſh nation would ſubmit to ſo ignominious a demand. Six thouſand horſe from Berwick, under the lord Evers, now joined the earl oſ Hartford. Leith and Edinburgh, aſter a feeble reſiſtance, yielded to the Engliſh commander; who abandoned them to pillage,</p></body></text></TEI>
