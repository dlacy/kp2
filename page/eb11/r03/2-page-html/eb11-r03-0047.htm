<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modern American Target Rifles.</span><span class="font1">—-In America, according to some authorities, there are three recognized departments of&nbsp;target shooting—namely off-hand shooting; shooting from a&nbsp;simple rest; and shooting from a machine rest, with telescopic&nbsp;or any other sight. For the first two classes small-bore rifles&nbsp;of 380 calibre or under only are used. The usual weight is from&nbsp;8 to 10 lb, with 28- or 30-in. barrel. Light charges for the&nbsp;shorter ranges are used. In the 380 bore only 55 grains of&nbsp;powder with a 330-grain bullet is employed. In the second-class&nbsp;contests, from a simple rest, the barrel is longer and the weight&nbsp;increased to just under 12 lb. The bore is generally -380. The&nbsp;usual range is 200 yds. The third-class shooting from a&nbsp;machine rest, generally with telescopic sights, is not much&nbsp;practised. Every kind of rifle is employed, usually of large bore&nbsp;and weighing from 20 to 60 lb. The long-range breech-loading&nbsp;match rifle, with which so much fine shooting was done when&nbsp;wiping out after each shot was allowed, weighed about 10 lb;&nbsp;the breech mechanism, any falling block, as the Sharp, Farquhar-son, Deeley, and Edge or Wiley, that admitted the insertion&nbsp;of the cleaning rod at the breech; length of barrel, 32 to 34 in.;&nbsp;seven or more grooves 003 to *005 in depth with a complete&nbsp;turn in 20 in. A sharp continual spiral and very shallow&nbsp;grooves constituted the feature of the American plan. Rigby’s&nbsp;plan was similar, with one turn in 18 in. and eight grooves,&nbsp;the lands being about half the width of the grooves. In the&nbsp;Wiley the grooves were fewer and wider. The Metford is an&nbsp;increasing twist, starting with one turn in 60 in. and finishing&nbsp;with one in 20, or sharper. The usual bore of the American long-range rifle was 458 or 461; powder, 76 grains of special “ fouling ” rifle powder; elongated cylindrical bullet of 540 grains.&nbsp;The pull-off was under 3 lb. During recent years smaller-bore&nbsp;smokeless-powder rifles have also been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Continental Match Rifles.—</span><span class="font1">The target rifle used by continental marksmen for medium ranges is a modification of the old&nbsp;pattern Swiss rifle, with scroll guard, hollowed butt plate and&nbsp;hair trigger. This latter, a mechanical device to free the&nbsp;tumbler from the sear without sufficient pull on the trigger to&nbsp;influence the aim, is disallowed in military arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sporting Rifles.—</span><span class="font1">Prior to 1845 smooth-bore guns with double charge of powder and an ounce spherical ball were generally&nbsp;preferred to rifles for sporting purposes and for large game;&nbsp;16 - bore muzzle-loading rifles were occasionally used by&nbsp;British sportsmen in the East Indies before that date, firing&nbsp;1 I drs. of powder with a spherical ounce ball. These rifles&nbsp;were sighted to 200 yds., but the trajectory was high and the&nbsp;penetration weak; they were also difficult to load when foul.&nbsp;The twist of the rifling was also too rapid, causing the bullet&nbsp;to strip with heavy charges of powder. According to Captain&nbsp;Forsyth and others, up to 1860 there was no known rifle suitable</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">for sporting purposes in India. Rifles of 12-bore gauge, firing a spherical ball, were subsequently made, with broad&nbsp;and shallow grooves making one turn in 10 ft. The bullet, of&nbsp;the same diameter as the bore, was loaded with a thin patch&nbsp;that took the grooving. These rifles proved very successful,&nbsp;possessing velocity equal to a smooth-bore of the same calibre,&nbsp;accuracy for sporting distances, flat trajectory and great&nbsp;striking power. In 1855 W. Greener produced the “ Cape&nbsp;rifle ” for South African sport, calibre 450 or 500; rifling,&nbsp;two deep grooves with one turn in 26 in., with a flanged bullet&nbsp;to fit the grooves; weight, 12 lb; sighted up to 1200 yds.&nbsp;This rifle was successful, and others were built by Purdey, who&nbsp;in 1856 named the pattern “ Express Train.” Since that date&nbsp;the word “ express ” has been generally used to denote a rifle&nbsp;possessing high velocity, flat trajectory and long fixed-sight&nbsp;range.@@<sup>2</sup> In America small-bore rifles were used earlier in the&nbsp;19th century. The celebrated Kentucky rifles were of various&nbsp;sizes, firing spherical balls of 90, 60 and 40 to the lb, and&nbsp;were renowned for their accuracy and fixed-sight range up to&nbsp;100 yds. Some maintain that the express rifle was developed&nbsp;from the Kentucky model. The modern express rifle may&nbsp;be defined as a breech-loading rifle with a height of trajectory&nbsp;not exceeding 4! in. at 150 yds., with a muzzle velocity of at&nbsp;least 1750 f.s. These rifles are usually 5- to 7-grooved,&nbsp;double-barrelled, with 26- to 28-in. barrels of 360, -400, 450,&nbsp;500 and 577 bores, weighing respectively from 6j to 7 lb,&nbsp;7 to 8 lb, 7Î to 9 lb, 81 to 10 Ib and 10} to 12 lb. The respective average charges are : bullet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font1">50 grains ; powder,&nbsp;50 grains; 209 and 82; 270 and no; 340 and 130; 520 and&nbsp;160; the fixed-sight ranges, 130, 160, 150,* 130 and 120 yds.&nbsp;Double and single express rifles of 303 bore with 26-in. barrels&nbsp;are also made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the invention of cordite powder and the advent of the small-bore high-velocity rifle for military purposes, the&nbsp;variety of sporting rifles with different-sized bores has increased.&nbsp;Sporting cordite express rifles are now made, both single- and&nbsp;double-barrelled, of the following calibres: 256, 265, 276,&nbsp;303, 310 ,360, 370, 375, 400, 450, 500, 577 and 600. Some&nbsp;of these calibres, such as 500, 577 and 600, are seldom used with&nbsp;cordite. The 450 cordite express is the largest bore high-velocity rifle recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The modern small-bore military rifle already described possesses all the best qualities of an express sporting rifle—&nbsp;namely accuracy, flat trajectory, high muzzle velocity and long&nbsp;point-blank or fixed-sight range up to 200 yds. The muzzle&nbsp;velocity of the *03 bore with black powder is 1850 f.s.; with&nbsp;cordite, 2100 f.s. The hollow-pointed or slit expanding bullet&nbsp;is generally used in these high-velocity rifles, as in the black-powder express, for ordinary sporting purposes, with the solid&nbsp;metal cartridge-case. The pointed bullet is also sometimes&nbsp;used, generally with the 375 and 475 calibre rifles, and gives&nbsp;an increased muzzle velocity of 2500 f.s. The trajectory of the&nbsp;cordite rifle is stated to be 10 in. flatter at 200 yds. than that of&nbsp;a black-powder rifle of similar calibre and corresponding charge.&nbsp;The variety of bores in sporting rifles is due largely to restrictions&nbsp;on the importation of arms of the military calibres (especially&nbsp;303) into India and South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sights of sporting express rifles are of some variety, and are usually designed and made with special care. The open </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">V</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup>The N.R.A. have recently sanctioned the use of the aperture sight in service rifles, provided it be attached to the weapon by&nbsp;the hinge-pin which fastens the ordinary folding leaf.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> The term “ point-blank range ” is often used in this connexion. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as ” point-blank range,”&nbsp;the bullet commencing to drop immediately it leaves the muzzle&nbsp;of the rifle. The path or trajectory of the bullet if .fired horizontally&nbsp;is therefore always a downward curve. The higher the muzzle&nbsp;velocity the flatter is this curve. The “ fixed-sight,” or so-called&nbsp;“ point-blank ” range, is usually taken at such range, generally&nbsp;100 yds. with black powder, and with such elevation as render the&nbsp;amount of drop of the bullet or curve of its path practically immaterial for sporting purposes, say a maximum of 4I in. At shorter&nbsp;range this curve would therefore take the bullet so much above&nbsp;the line of fixed-sight aim, and must where necessary be allowed for.&nbsp;With the high-velocity small-bore rifle the fixed-sight range can be&nbsp;increased to 200 yds. for the sporting rifle ; and for military purposes&nbsp;’ in the field to 500 yds. and (with pointed bullets) even more.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
