<p><span class="font0">Africa: no Trionyx occurs in Madagascar. On the other hand species are found of Testudo, Chersine, Sternotherus, and Pelοmedusa,&nbsp;which are spread also over a greater or lesser area of the continent.&nbsp;Two Chelonians, Pyxis and Dumeriliα, are peculiar to Madagascar,&nbsp;the latter nearly allied to the South-American Peltoccphalus. The&nbsp;Madagascar Crocodile is closely allied to the common African&nbsp;species. ; and its presence in the island can be easily accounted for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the Lizards we find a distinctly South-American element in two Iguanoid genera, Hοplurus and Chalarodon, replacing the&nbsp;Old World Agamidæ. The absence of Varanidæ, Laeertidæ, and&nbsp;Amphisbænidæ removes Madagascar from Africa, whilst the extraordinary development of Chamæleonidæ (more than twenty species)&nbsp;and the presence of Gerrhosauridæ and Zouuridæ are important&nbsp;features common to both. Avery small family (Uroplatidæ} is&nbsp;peculiar to Madagascar. No special relation to the Indian region&nbsp;is shown by this Lacertilian fauna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With regard to Ophidians, Madagascar has hardly anything in common with Africa. The African fauna is characterized by the great&nbsp;development of Lycodonts,—they are absent in Madagascar ; and of&nbsp;the four families of African poisonous Snakes Madagascar does&nbsp;not possess a single one. When we analyse the affinities of the&nbsp;twenty-seven species known at present from Madagascar, we arrive&nbsp;at the following conclusions :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snakes without distinct relations to any particular region :—&nbsp;Tyρhlops (six species), Ablabes (one species), Ithyeyphus (one&nbsp;species), Dipsadoboa (one species).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snakes with affinities to the African fauna :—Mimophis (one&nbsp;species), Pedophilus (one species).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snakes with affinities to the Indian fauna :—Ptyas (one&nbsp;species), Langaha (one species).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snakes with affinities to the South-American fauna :—Liophis&nbsp;(one species), Taehymenis (one species), Pseiidoxyrhopus (two&nbsp;species), Heterodon (two species), Dromieus (one species), Herpeto-dryas (one species), Philodryas (one species), Dipsas (two species),&nbsp;Xiphosoma (one species).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Africa shows affinities to all the three other equatorial regions, but chiefly to the Indian. No sharply defined&nbsp;boundary exists between the two regions, the intervening&nbsp;parts of Asia being inhabited by a desert fauna which&nbsp;penetrates into districts of similar nature in Africa as well&nbsp;as in India. Certain genera and species belonging to this&nbsp;desert fauna are therefore common to both regions. But&nbsp;there are, besides, other points of affinity of deeper significance, such as the development in both of a distinct&nbsp;Trionycoid genus, besides the typical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font1"> the general&nbsp;distribution of Agamoids and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanidæ,</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> the presence of&nbsp;the remarkable family of Lycodonts, which do not occur&nbsp;anywhere else, of the large forms of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Python</span><span class="font1"> with concomitant absence of Booids, and of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elapidæ,</span><span class="font1"> of which&nbsp;one genus (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Naja</span><span class="font1">) extends from the west coast of Africa to&nbsp;Borneo. But these resemblances are fully counterbalanced&nbsp;by great differences in other portions of the Reptilian&nbsp;fauna : the Indian Emydoids are replaced by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydidæ</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;Africa, a type which it has in common with Australia and&nbsp;South America, whereas India possesses no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbænidæ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">no Chamæleons.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> With regard to Ophidians, the number&nbsp;of forms generally is greatly diminished in Africa, but the&nbsp;proportion of poisonous Snakes is doubled. The Pit&nbsp;Vipers of India are wholly absent, and are replaced by&nbsp;true Vipers. In the Indian region arboreal Agamoid&nbsp;Lizards prevail ; in Africa the Snakes show a greater&nbsp;tendency towards a modification of the habitus and&nbsp;structure for arboreal life. The Freshwater Snakes and&nbsp;Colubers which are so numerous in India are much&nbsp;reduced in numbers in Africa, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tropidonoti</span><span class="font1"> being almost&nbsp;entirely absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Tropical Pacific Region.—</span><span class="font1">So far as Reptiles are&nbsp;concerned, Tasmania has to be included in this region.&nbsp;No </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emys</span><span class="font1"> goes eastwards beyond Wallace’s&nbsp;hne. In fact, the Chelonian type disappears in the&nbsp;islands between this line and the Australian continent—&nbsp;with two exceptions. A species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo (T. forstenii)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">occurs in, and is limited to, the island of Gilolo ; and</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these Lacertilian families extend into the Australian region ;&nbsp;in fact they replace the Iguanoids of the western hemisphere and&nbsp;Madagascar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the single exception mentioned above.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cuora amboinensis,</span><span class="font1"> the most common Tortoise of Malaya, occurs in many of the eastern islands, but it has probably&nbsp;been imported by man, and by the same means may be&nbsp;still extending its range. On the continent of Australia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydidæ</span><span class="font1"> only occur, viz., eight species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelemys&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and five of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelodina.</span><span class="font1"> In Tasmania, again, Chelonians&nbsp;are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the common Indian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crοcodilus porosus,</span><span class="font1"> which may be considered an immigrant into this region, one or&nbsp;two other species of the same genus inhabit the fresh&nbsp;waters of the truly tropical parts, and are peculiar to&nbsp;Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bulk of the Lacertilian fauna is composed of Skinks, Geckos, Agamoids, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanidæ,</span><span class="font1"> with the addition of a&nbsp;small family which is peculiar to the region, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pygo∙&nbsp;podidæ.</span><span class="font1"> A peculiar type, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hibamus,</span><span class="font1"> has been found in&nbsp;New Guinea; and, finally, a single Iguanoid, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brachylophus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is common in the Fiji Islands ; how it came there, or how&nbsp;it survived its severance from the American stock, is a&nbsp;mystery. The Skinks are in this region more highly&nbsp;developed and more specialized than in any other part of&nbsp;the world ; they exceed in numbers the Geckos, which&nbsp;generally accompany the Skinks in their range over the&nbsp;smaller islands of the Pacific; in these islands members&nbsp;of these two families represent the whole of the Lacertilian fauna. The Australian Agamoids are chiefly peculiar&nbsp;and partly much differentiated forms, but some have&nbsp;distinct affinities to, or are even identical with, Indian&nbsp;genera. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanidæ</span><span class="font1"> are also closely allied to Indian&nbsp;species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The total number of Snakes amount to ninety species, of which twelve are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops,</span><span class="font1"> eight other innocuous&nbsp;Colubrines, fifty </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elapidæ,</span><span class="font1"> one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erycine,</span><span class="font1"> fourteen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pythonidæ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and five </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boidæ.</span><span class="font1"> The number of poisonous Snakes, therefore, exceeds that of innocuous, a proportion quite unparalleled in any other part of the world. The few&nbsp;innocuous Colubrine Snakes belong to Indian genera, and&nbsp;evidently have spread from that region; but all the&nbsp;genera of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elapidæ</span><span class="font1"> (twelve), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erycidæ</span><span class="font1"> (one), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pythonidæ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(five), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boidæ</span><span class="font1"> (three) are peculiar to this region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Australia we meet, therefore, with the interesting fact that, whilst it is closely allied to South America, but&nbsp;totally distinct from India, by its Chelonians, its Lizards&nbsp;and Colubrine Snakes connect it with this latter region.&nbsp;With regard to the other Ophidians, they, although&nbsp;peculiar genera, have their nearest allies partly in India&nbsp;partly in South America; and the character of the&nbsp;Australian Snake fauna consists chiefly in its peculiar&nbsp;composition, differing thereby more from the other&nbsp;equatorial regions than these do among themselves.&nbsp;Wallace’s line marks the boundary between India and&nbsp;Australia only as far as Chelonians are concerned, but it&nbsp;is quite effaced by the distribution of Lizards and Snakes.&nbsp;Thus in New Guinea Lizards of the Indian region are&nbsp;mixed with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pygopodidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and an island as far east as&nbsp;Timorlaut is inhabited by six Snakes, three of which are&nbsp;peculiarly Indian, whilst the other three are as decidedly&nbsp;Australian. The islands north of New Guinea and of&nbsp;Melanesia are not yet occupied by the Ophidian type, and&nbsp;only species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enygrus</span><span class="font1"> have penetrated eastwards as far&nbsp;as the Low Archipelago, whilst the Fiji Islands and the&nbsp;larger islands of Melanesia have sufficiently long been&nbsp;raised above the level of the sea to develop quite peculiar&nbsp;genera of Snakes. Tasmania is tenanted by poisonous&nbsp;Snakes only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Tropical American Region.—</span><span class="font1">An examination of&nbsp;the distribution of Chelonians in the New World leads to&nbsp;a different division of its regions from that of the other&nbsp;Reptiles. Central America and the West Indies, with&nbsp;regard to Chelonians, cannot be united with the Southern</span></p>
