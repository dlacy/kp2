<p><span class="font1">together with a Syllabus of eighty of the most important “errors of our time ” (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syllabus).</span><span class="font1"> These two documents caused&nbsp;an excitement nowadays hard to understand. Apart&nbsp;from some fulminations against such modern pests&nbsp;as “ socialism, communism, secret societies, Bible&nbsp;societies, clerico-liberal societies,” the Syllabus says nothing&nbsp;that the papacy had not been saying for hundreds of years.&nbsp;Its real object is to attack such professedly Catholic governments as have fallen in with modern ideas—as for instance, by&nbsp;allowing freedom of worship to their Protestant subjects, or by&nbsp;refusing to punish brawling in Catholic churches more severely&nbsp;than other breaches of the peace. In other words, Pius utterly&nbsp;rejected the whole principle of toleration, and declared that the&nbsp;Church would still impose itself by force, whenever it got the&nbsp;chance to do so. However, any hopes he may have had of&nbsp;finding another Philip II. were soon dashed to the ground.&nbsp;Eighteen months after the publication of the Syllabus broke&nbsp;out the Austro-Prussian War (June 1866), when the one faithful ally of Rome was trampled under the feet of the arch-Protestant Hohenzollerns. But the pope’s spirit was not&nbsp;broken. If he could not lord it over one sphere, at least he&nbsp;could be master in another. In 1869 he summoned a general&nbsp;council at the Vatican, avowedly for the purpose of getting it&nbsp;to declare his personal infallibility. For although&nbsp;the old rivalry between pope and council had long ago&nbsp;been practically settled in favour of the pope, no&nbsp;council had yet formally acknowledged its defeat.&nbsp;Indeed, many prominent French and German divines&nbsp;still denied papal infallibility altogether; and Louis Napoleon&nbsp;had regularly fallen back on Richelieu’s old device of stirring&nbsp;up the embers of Gallicanism, whenever the French clergy&nbsp;grew restive about his alliance with Victor Emmanuel. And&nbsp;even the more moderate believers in the pope’s infallibility&nbsp;maintained that it was merely negative, a heaven-sent immunity against falling into error. But Pius and his immediate&nbsp;circle argued that this was not enough. The great need of the&nbsp;age was authority; and authority was most likely to strike the&nbsp;imagination of the faithful if it found a vivid concrete embodiment in the person of the pope. He must not simply be immune&nbsp;from error; truth must stream down on his head from heaven,&nbsp;and on his head alone. “ We all know only one thing for&nbsp;certain,” wrote the great Catholic pamphleteer, Louis Veuillot,&nbsp;“ and that is that no one knows anything, except the man with&nbsp;whom God is for ever, the man who carries the thoughts of&nbsp;God.” But this view was too extreme for the council; the&nbsp;most Pius could hope for was to be declared immune from&nbsp;error, instead of positively inspired. Even this negative infallibility was stoutly contested by the French and German&nbsp;bishops during the eight months that the council lasted (December 1869 to July 1870). But they were richer in talents&nbsp;than numbers: out of six hundred prelates they only commanded eighty votes. Most left Rome before the final session;&nbsp;only two—one from Naples, one from the United States—continued their protest up to the end. On the 18th of July the&nbsp;pope’s decrees were declared “ irreformable of themselves,&nbsp;irrespectively of the consent of the Church,” always provided&nbsp;that they dealt with doctrines of faith and morals, and were&nbsp;•delivered </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedra—</span><span class="font1">that is, with the intention of binding&nbsp;the consciences of all Catholics. These limitations were the&nbsp;work of the moderate infallibilists, but the real hero of the&nbsp;day was Pius. Theologians might draw their fine-spun distinctions between realms where the pope was actually infallible&nbsp;and realms where he was not; but Pius knew well that loyal&nbsp;Catholic common sense would brush their technicalities aside&nbsp;and hold that on any conceivable question the pope was fifty&nbsp;times more likely to be right than any one else (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican&nbsp;Council</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Infallibility).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So absolute became the papal sovereignty over conscience that more than one government took alarm. While the council&nbsp;was still sitting the Bavarian minister, Prince Chlodwig zu&nbsp;Hohenlohe-Schillingsfiirst, suggested to Bismarck that the&nbsp;Powers would do well to bring its deliberations to an end; and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">immediately after the publication of its decrees Austria notified the pope that so vast an extension of the Church’s claims would&nbsp;necessitate a revision of the concordat. And when the excommunication of DolUnger and other anti-infallibilist divines&nbsp;(1871) led to the formation of an independent Old </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">om&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">CathoUc Church (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Old Catholics)</span><span class="font1"> Bavaria, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cathou-</span><span class="font1">Switzerland and other countries gave it a warm wel- <sup>cl</sup>*<sup>m</sup>*&nbsp;come. So also did Berlin. The new German empire, consolidated through wars with Catholic Germany and Catholic&nbsp;France, was of all countries least likely to tolerate Roman&nbsp;attempts to dictate to its subjects. Tension was increased by&nbsp;the fact that the Centre, or Catholic, party in the Reichstag&nbsp;was led by Windhorst, formerly prime minister to the dispossessed king of Hanover, and thus naturally became identified with the opposition of the smaller German states to the&nbsp;supremacy of Prussia. The quarrel began in 1871 when the&nbsp;Prussian government supported some teachers in state-aided&nbsp;CathoUc schools whom the bishops wished to dismiss on account&nbsp;of their anti-infallibilist opinions. A year later, under the&nbsp;ministry of Falk, it developed into what the great scientist,&nbsp;RudolfVirchow,called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ktdturkampf</span><span class="font1">,or conflict of civilizations.&nbsp;Thefamous Maylaws (1873) were a determined attempt&nbsp;to bring the literary education, appointment and discipline of the clergy under state control, and to regulate&nbsp;the use of such spiritual penalties as deprivation and excommunication. When the bishops refused to obey, Falk fell back&nbsp;on force. The Jesuits were banished from the German Empire,&nbsp;and most of the other orders from Prussia. The archbishops of&nbsp;Gnesen and Cologne and many minor dignitaries were imprisoned (1874); and the so-caUed “Bread-basket Law” was&nbsp;passed to coerce the parish clergy by suspending the salaries&nbsp;of the disobedient. The result of these severities was exactly&nbsp;the opposite of what Falk intended. Hc had meant only to&nbsp;lop off a few ultramontane extremists; he succeeded in sending CathoUcs of every shade and colour pell-meU into the arms&nbsp;of Rome. And the effect remained long after the cause had&nbsp;died away. On the death of Pius IX. (February 1878) his&nbsp;successor, Leo XIII., at once showed himself <sup>i</sup>WilUng to come to&nbsp;terms. Negotiations were long and difficult; for Bismarck&nbsp;would not aboUsh the May laws outright, and Leo had much&nbsp;ado to hold in check the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zelanti</span><span class="font1"> of the Vatican. But Falk&nbsp;retired in 1879; various mutual concessions were made which&nbsp;led to a gradual abrogation of the May laws. Yet—thanks&nbsp;to its organization, its press, and the elaborate network of&nbsp;alliances spun by Windhorst—the Ultramontane Centre still&nbsp;refnains a powerful force in German poUtics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This conciliatory policy towards BerUn was the first-fruits of a new régime; Leo XlII. was in every way a complete contrast&nbsp;to Pius IX. Pius had fed on inspirations; Leo was&nbsp;a man of calm, deliberate judgment, Uttle likely to&nbsp;yield to the promptings of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">monsignori.</span><span class="font1"> He was&nbsp;a poUshed scholar of the old-fashioned type; early in his reign&nbsp;he threw open the Vatican Archives to the students of the&nbsp;world. Having spent his youth in the papal diplomatic service&nbsp;—he was nuncio at Brussels from 1843-46—he had a certain&nbsp;knowledge of the workings of parUamentary institutions, while&nbsp;the years immediately before his accession had been spent as&nbsp;archbishop of Perugia, so that he was not closely identified&nbsp;with any of the Vatican parties. The results of a change of&nbsp;master were soon seen. Pius IX. had died at war with almost&nbsp;every country in Europe. He had quarrelled with Austria;&nbsp;Russia was persecuting its Catholic subjects; France was&nbsp;under the spell of Gambetta and his doctrine that clericalism&nbsp;was the enemy; Spain and Belgium followed France; even&nbsp;Switzerland was waging a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kulturkampf</span><span class="font1"> on a smaU scale. In a&nbsp;few years Leo had made peace with Austria, pacified Switzerland and Belgium, opened up negotiations with Russia; while&nbsp;his elevation of Newman to the cardinalate (1879) made a great&nbsp;impression in Great Britain. About 1886 hopes even ran&nbsp;high that he was on the eve of a reconciliation with King Humbert at the Quirinal. These hopes were vain. Leo was absolutely convinced that a territorial sovereignty was required to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
