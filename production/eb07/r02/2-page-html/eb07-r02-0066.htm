<p><span class="font0">State religion, but all others are tolerated. The Catholics are few in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Catholics abound in Russia, but mostly in the Polish provinces, where they are not only freely tolerated, but enjoy every political right in common with other subjects. Their&nbsp;number may amount to about 12,000,000, or l-5th of the&nbsp;population of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, popery is dominant and exclusive ; but other religions, though not legally tolerated,&nbsp;are not now persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Turkey and Greece popery is fully tolerated, but professed by few if by any of the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In America popery is the dominant religion of all the late Spanish and Portuguese colonies. In some of them no&nbsp;other religion is tolerated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">by law,</span><span class="font0"> but nobody is persecuted&nbsp;for professing any other. In the United States of North&nbsp;America, there are about 800,000 Catholics. In Lower&nbsp;Canada, they form the majority of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Great Britain popery is now not merely tolerated, but Roman Catholics are admitted to equal, or nearly equal, political rights witll Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1837, the total number of Catholics throughout the world, was reckoned by Adrien Balbi at 1.39,000,000, out&nbsp;of 737,000,000, which he considers to be the total population of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before the passing of tile various Roman Catholic Emancipation Acts, the Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland were subjected to a system of stringent penal laws. The laws in&nbsp;force against them, previously to the Act 18 Geo. III. cap.&nbsp;60; and 31 Geo. III. cap. 32, may be divided into three&nbsp;classes: 1. Those respecting persons professing popery.&nbsp;2. Those respecting popish recusants convict. 3. Those respecting popish priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons professing popery, besides the penalties for&nbsp;not attending their parish church, were disabled from taking&nbsp;their lands by either descent or purchase, after eighteen years&nbsp;of age, until they renounced tbeir errors ; were obliged at&nbsp;twenty-one to register their estates before acquired, and all&nbsp;future conveyances and wills relating to them ; were incapable of presenting to any advowson, or granting to any other&nbsp;person any avoidance of the same ; might not keep or teach&nbsp;any school under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and if they&nbsp;willingly heard or said mass, they forfeited for the one 100,&nbsp;and tor the other 200 marks, and were to suffer a year’s&nbsp;imprisonment. If any evil industry was used to rivet the&nbsp;errors of popery upon those who already professed it ; if any&nbsp;person sent another abroad to be educated in popery, or to&nbsp;reside in any religious house for that purpose, or contributed&nbsp;to his maintenance when there, the sent, the sender, and the&nbsp;contributor, were disabled to sue in law or equity, to be executor or administrators to any person, or to bear any office&nbsp;in the realm, and forfeited all their goods and chattels, and&nbsp;likewise all their real estate for life. Where these errors&nbsp;were aggravated by apostacy or perversion, where a person&nbsp;was reconciled to the see of Rome, or procured others to&nbsp;be reconciled, the offence amounted to high treason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popish recusants convicted in a court of law of not&nbsp;attending the service of the Church -of England, were subject to the following disabilities, penalties, and forfeitures,&nbsp;over and above those before mentioned. They were considered as persons excommunicated; they could hold no office or employment ; if they kept arms in their houses, the&nbsp;same might be seized by the Justices of the Peace ; they&nbsp;might not come within ten miles of London, under the penalty&nbsp;ol’L 100; could bring no action at law or suit in equity; were&nbsp;not allowed to travel above five miles from home, unless by&nbsp;licence, upon pain of forfeiting all their goods; and they&nbsp;might not come to court under the penalty of L.100. No&nbsp;marriage or burial of such recusant, or baptism of his child,&nbsp;should be had otherwise than by the ministers of the Church&nbsp;of England, underother severe penalties. A married woman,&nbsp;when recusant, forfeited two-thirds of her dower or jointure, and might not be executrix, or administratrix to her&nbsp;husband, or have any part of his goods; and during the&nbsp;coverture might be kept in prison, unless her husband redeemed her at the rate of L.l 0 a month, or the third part of&nbsp;all his lands. And, lastly, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a.femme couverte</span><span class="font0"> (married woman) recusant might be imprisoned, so all others must,&nbsp;within three months after conviction, either submit, and renounce their errors, or, if required so to do by four justices,&nbsp;abjure and renounce the realm ; and if they did not depart,&nbsp;or if they returned without the king’s licence, they should&nbsp;be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy. There w<sup>,</sup>as&nbsp;also an inferior kind of recusancy, (refusing to make the declaration against popery enjoined by Act 30 Car. II. cap.&nbsp;2, when tendered by the proper magistrate,) which, if the&nbsp;party resided within ten miles of London, made him an absolute recusant convict ; or, if at a greater distance, suspended him from having any seat in Parliament, keeping&nbsp;arms in his house, or any horse above the value of L.5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III. Popish priests were placed in a still more slavish situation. For, by statute 11 and 12 Wil. III. c. 4, popish&nbsp;priests or bishops celebrating mass, and exercising any part&nbsp;of their functions in England, except in the houses of ambassadors, were liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by&nbsp;the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2, any popish priest bom in the&nbsp;dominions of the crown of England, who should come&nbsp;hither from beyond sea, or should be in England without&nbsp;conforming, and taking the oaths, was guilty of high treason ; and all persons harbouring him were guilty of felony&nbsp;without benefit of clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first amendment of these inhuman laws, which affix an everlasting stain on the British name, was effected by&nbsp;the statute 18 Geo. III. c. 60. With regard to such&nbsp;papists as should duly take the oath therein prescribed, of&nbsp;allegiance to his Majesty, abjuration of the Pretender, renunciation of the Pope’s civil power, and abhorrence of the&nbsp;doctrines of destroying and not keeping faith with heretics,&nbsp;and deposing or murdering princes excommunicated by authority of the see of Rome, the statute 11 and 12 W. III.&nbsp;was repealed, so far as it disabled them from purchasing or&nbsp;inheriting, or authorized the apprehending or prosecuting&nbsp;of the popish clergy, or subjected them or any teachers of&nbsp;youth to perpetual imprisonment. By the statute 31 Geo.&nbsp;III. c. 32. all the restrictions and penalties above enumerated, were removed from those Catholics who were willing&nbsp;to comply with the requisitions of that statute, which were,&nbsp;that they must appear at some of the courts of Westminster, or at the quarter sessions held for the county, city, or&nbsp;place where they might reside, and make and subscribe a&nbsp;declaration that they professed the Roman Catholic religion, and also an oath exactly similar to that required by&nbsp;18 Geo. III. c. 60. On this declaration and oath being&nbsp;duly made by any Roman Catholic, the officer of the court&nbsp;was authorised to grant him a certificate ; and such officer was required yearly to transmit to the Privy Council&nbsp;lists of all persons who had thus qualified themselves within the year in his court. Roman Catholics thus qualified&nbsp;were not to be prosecuted under any statute for not repairing to a parish church, nor for attending or performing mass or other ceremonies of the Church </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">οi'</span><span class="font0"> Rome. But&nbsp;no Roman Catholic minister was to officiate in any place&nbsp;of worship having a steeple and bell, or at any funeral in&nbsp;a churchyard, or was to wear the habits of his order, except in a place allow ed by the statute, or in a private house&nbsp;where there should not be more than five persons besides&nbsp;the family. No person who had qualified was to be prosecuted for instructing youth, except in an endowed school,&nbsp;or in one of the English universities ; or in the case of receiving into his school the child of any Protestant father;&nbsp;and no Roman Catholic was to keep a school until his or her&nbsp;name should be recorded as a teacher at the sessions.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
