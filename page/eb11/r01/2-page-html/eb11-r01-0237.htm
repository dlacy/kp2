<p><span class="font1">REFORMED EPISCOPAL CHURCH, a Protestant community in the United States of America, dating from December 1873.&nbsp;The influence of the Tractarian movement began to be felt at&nbsp;an early date in the Episcopal Church of the United States, and&nbsp;the ordination of Arthur Carey in New York, July 1843, a&nbsp;clergyman who denied that there was any difference in points of&nbsp;faith between the Anglican and the Roman Churches and considered the Reformation an unjustifiable act, brought into&nbsp;relief the antagonism between Low Church and High Church,&nbsp;a struggle whiçh went on for a generation with increasing&nbsp;bitterness. The High Church party lost no opportunity of&nbsp;arraigning any Low Churchman who conducted services in&nbsp;non-episcopal churches, and as the Triennial Conference gave&nbsp;no heed to remonstrances on the part of these ecclesiastical&nbsp;offenders they came to the conclusion that they must either crush&nbsp;their consciences or seek relief in separation. The climax was&nbsp;reached when George D. Cummins (1822-1876), assistant bishop&nbsp;of Kentucky, was angrily attacked for officiating at the united&nbsp;communion service held at the meeting of the Sixth General&nbsp;Conference of the Evangelical Alliance in New York, October&nbsp;1873. This prelate resigned his charge in the Episcopal Church&nbsp;on November 11th, and a month later, with seven other clergymen&nbsp; and a score of laymen, constituted the Reformed Episcopal&nbsp;Church. Cummins was chosen as presiding officer of the new&nbsp;body, and consecrated Charles E. Cheney (b. 1836), rector of&nbsp;Christ Church, Chicago, to be bishop. The following Declaration&nbsp;of Principles (here abridged) was promulgated:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. </span><span class="font1">An </span><span class="font0">expression of belief in the Bible as the Word of God, and the sole rule of faith and practice, in the Apostles’ Creed, in the&nbsp;divine institution of the two sacraments and in the doctrines of&nbsp;grace substantially as set out in the 39 Articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">IL The recognition of Episcopacy not as of divine right but as a very ancient and desirable form of church polity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">An acceptance of the Prayer Book as revised by the general&nbsp;Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1785, with&nbsp;liberty to revise it as may seem most conducive to the edification&nbsp;of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A condemnation of certain positions, viz. :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(a) That the Church of God exists only in one form of ecclesiastical polity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">) That Christian ministers as distinct from all believers have any special priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0">) That the Lord’s Table is an altar on which the body and blood of Christ are offered anew to the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">) That the presence of Christ is a material one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e)</span><span class="font0"> That Regeneration is inseparably connected with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Church recognizes no orders of ministry, presbyters and deacons; the Episcopate is an office, not an order, the bishop&nbsp;being the chief presbyter, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primus inter pares.</span><span class="font1"> There are some&nbsp;7 bishops, 85 clergy and about 9500 communicants. £1600&nbsp;annually is raised for foreign missionary work in India. The&nbsp;Church was introduced into England in 1877, and has in&nbsp;that country a presiding bishop and about 20 organized congregations&nbsp;. The Church has a theological seminary in Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFRACTION (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">refringere,</span><span class="font1"> to break open or apart), in physics, the change in the direction of a wave of light, heat or&nbsp;sound which occurs when such a wave passes from one medium&nbsp;into another of different density.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Refraction of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a ray of light traversing a homogeneous medium falls on the bounding surface of another transparent homogeneous&nbsp;medium, it is found that the direction of the transmitted ray&nbsp;in the second medium is different from that of the incident&nbsp;ray; in other words, the ray is refracted or bent at the&nbsp;point of incidence. The laws governing refraction are:&nbsp;(1) the refracted and incident rays are coplanar with the&nbsp;normal to the refracting surface at the point of incidence,&nbsp;and (2) the ratio of the sines of the angles between the&nbsp;normal and the incident and refracted rays is constant for the&nbsp;two media, but depends on the nature of the light employed,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e</span><span class="font1">. on its wave length. This constant is called the relative&nbsp;refractive index of the second medium, and may be denoted&nbsp;by µ</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>ab</sub></span><span class="font1">, the suffix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab</span><span class="font1"> signifying that the light passes from&nbsp;medium </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> to medium </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1">; similarly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μ<sub>ba</sub></span><span class="font1"> denotes the relative&nbsp;refractive index of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> with regard to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b.</span><span class="font1"> The absolute refractive&nbsp;index is the index when the first medium is a vacuum. Elementary phenomena in refraction, such as the apparent bending&nbsp;of a stick when partially immersed in water, were observed in&nbsp;very remote times, but the laws, as stated above, were first&nbsp;grasped in the 17th century by W. Snell and published by&nbsp;Descartes, the full importance of the dependence of the refractive&nbsp;index on the nature of the light employed being first thoroughly&nbsp;realized by Newton in his famous prismatic decomposition of&nbsp;white fight into a coloured spectrum. Newton gave a theoretical interpretation of these laws on the basis of his corpuscular&nbsp;theory, as did also Huygens on the wave theory (see Light, H.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of).</span><span class="font1"> In this article we only consider refractions at&nbsp;plane surfaces, refraction at spherical surfaces being treated&nbsp;under Lens. The geometrical theory will be followed, the&nbsp;wave theory being treated in Light, Diffraction and Dispersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Refraction at a Plane Surface.—</span><span class="font0">Let LM (fig. 1) be the surface</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dividing two homogeneous media A and B; let IO be a ray in the first medium incident on LM at O, and let OR be the refracted&nbsp;ray. Draw the normal POQ. Then by Snell’s law we have&nbsp;invariably sin IOP/sin QOR=µ</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>ab</sub></span><span class="font0">. Hence if two of these&nbsp;quantities be given the third can be calculated. The commonest&nbsp;question is: Given the incident ray and the refractive index to&nbsp;construct the refracted ray. A simple construction is to take&nbsp;along the incident ray OI, unit distance OC, and a distance OD&nbsp;equal to the refractive index in the same units. Draw CE&nbsp;perpendicular to LM, and draw an arc with centre O and radius&nbsp;OD, cutting CE in E. Then EO produced downwards is the&nbsp;refracted ray. The proof is left to the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the figure the given incident ray is assumed to be passing from a less dense to a denser medium, and it is seen by the construction&nbsp; or by examining the formula sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß =</span><span class="font0"> sin α</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">/µ</span><span class="font0"> that for all&nbsp;values of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font0"> there is a corresponding value of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß.</span><span class="font0"> Consider the&nbsp;case when the light passes from a denser to a less dense medium.&nbsp;In the equation sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">β</span><span class="font0">=sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α/µ</span><span class="font0"> we have in this case µ&lt;1. Now&nbsp;if sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font0">&lt;µ, we have sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a/µ&lt;</span><span class="font0"> 1, and hence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> is real. If sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α = µ,</span><span class="font0"> then&nbsp;sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß=1, i.e. β = </span><span class="font0">90°; in other words, the refracted ray in the&nbsp;second medium passes parallel to and grazes the bounding surface.&nbsp;The angle of incidence, which is given by sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">δ=i/µ,</span><span class="font0"> is termed&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">critical angle.</span><span class="font0"> For greater values it is obvious that sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font0">/µ&gt;1&nbsp;and there is no refraction into the second medium, the rays being&nbsp;totally reflected back into the first medium; this is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">total&nbsp;internal reflection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Images produced by Refraction at Plane Surfaces.—</span><span class="font0">If a luminous point be situated in a medium separated from one of less density&nbsp;by a plane surface, the ray normal to this surface will be unrefracted, whilst the others will undergo refraction according to&nbsp;their angles of emergence. If the rays in the less dense medium&nbsp;be produced into the denser medium, they envelop a caustic, but&nbsp;by restricting ourselves to a small area about the normal ray it&nbsp;is seen that they intersect this ray in a point which is the geometrical </span></p>
