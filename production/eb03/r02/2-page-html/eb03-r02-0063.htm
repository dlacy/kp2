<p><span class="font0">quickly deepened its bed ; and this circqmſtance increaſing its velocity, as we have ſeen, would extend this deepening backward to the lake, and draw off more of&nbsp;its waters. The work would go on rapidly at firſt, while&nbsp;earth and ſmall ſtones only reſiſted the labours of nature ; but theſe being waſhed away, and the channel&nbsp;hollowed out to the firm rock on all ſides, the operation&nbsp;muſt go on very ſlowly, till the immenſe caſcade ſhall&nbsp;undermine what it cannot break off, and then a new&nbsp;diſcharge will commence, and a quantity of flat ground&nbsp;will emerge all round the lake. The torrent, in the&nbsp;mean time, makes its way down the country, and digs&nbsp;a canal, which may be called the firſt ſhetch of a river,&nbsp;which will deepen and widen its bed continually. The&nbsp;waters of ſeveral baſons united, and running together in&nbsp;a great body, will (according to the principles we have&nbsp;eſtabliſhed) have a much greater velocity, with the&nbsp;fame ſlope, than thoſe of the lakes in the interior parts&nbsp;of the continent ; and the ſum of them all united in&nbsp;the baſon next the ſea, after having broken through&nbsp;its natural mound, 'will make a prodigious torrent,&nbsp;which will dig for itſelf a bed ſo much the deeper as it&nbsp;has more ſlope and a greater body of waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The formation of the firſt valleys, by cutting open many ſprings which were formerly concealed under&nbsp;ground, will add to the maſs of running waters, and&nbsp;contribute to drain off the waters of theſe baſons. In&nbsp;courſe of time many of them will diſappear, and flat valleys among the mountains and hills are the traces of their&nbsp;former exiſtence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When nature thus traces out the courſes of future rivers, it is to be expected that thoſe ſtreams will moſt&nbsp;deepen their channels which in their approach to the&nbsp;ſea receive into their bed the greateſt quantities of&nbsp;rain and ſpring waters, and that towards the middle of&nbsp;the continent they will deepen their channels leſs. In&nbsp;theſe laſt ſituations the natural ſlope of the fields&nbsp;cauſes the rain-water, rills, and the little rivulets from&nbsp;the ſprings, to ſeek their way to the rivers. The ground&nbsp;can fink only by the flattening of the hills and high&nbsp;grounds ; and this muſt proceed with extreme ſlowneſs,&nbsp;becauſe it is only the gentle, though inceſſant, work of&nbsp;the rains and ſprings. But the rivers, increaſing in bulk&nbsp;and ſtrength, and of neceſſity ſlowing over every thing,&nbsp;form to themſelves capacious beds in a more yielding&nbsp;foil, and dig them even to the level of the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The beds of rivers by no means form themſelves in one inclined plane. If we ſhould ſuppoſe a canal AB&nbsp;(fig. 12.) perfectly ſtraight and horizontal at B, where&nbsp;it joins with the ſea, this canal would really be an inclined channel of greater and greater ſlope as it is farther from B. This is evident ; becauſe gravity is directed towards the centre of the earth, and the angle&nbsp;CAB contained between the channel and the plumb-line at A is ſmaller than the ſimilar angle CDB ; and&nbsp;conſequently the inclination to the horizon is greater in&nbsp;A. than in D. Such a canal therefore would make the&nbsp;bed of a river ; and ſome have thought that this was&nbsp;the real form of nature’s work ; but the ſuppoſition is&nbsp;a whim, and it is falle. No river has a ſlope at all approaching to this. It would be 8 inches declivity in&nbsp;the mile next the ocean, 24 inches in the ſecond mile,&nbsp;40 inches in the third, and ſo on in the duplicate ratio&nbsp;(for the whole elevation) of the diſtances from the ſea.&nbsp;Such a river would quickly tear up its bed in the moun</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">tains (were there any grounds high enough to receive it), and, except its firſt caſcade, would ſoon acquire a&nbsp;more gentle ſlope. But the fact is, and it is the reſult&nbsp;of the impreſcriptible laws of nature, that the continued&nbsp;track of a river is a ſucceſſion of inclined channels,&nbsp;whoſe ſlope diminiſhes by ſteps as the river approaches&nbsp;to the ſea. It is not enough to ſay that this reſults&nbsp;from the natural ſlope of the .countries through which&nbsp;it flows, which we obſerve to increaſe in declivity as we&nbsp;go to the interior parts of the continent. Were it&nbsp;otherwiſe, the equilibrium to which nature aims in all&nbsp;her operations w<sup>r</sup>ould ſtill produce the gradual diminution of the ſlope of rivers. Without it they could not&nbsp;be in a permanent train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That we may more eaſily form a notion of the manner in which the permanent courſe of a river is eſtabliſhed, let us ſuppoſe a ſtream or rivulet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sa</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 13.) far up the country, make its way through a ſoil perfectly uniform to the ſea, taking the courſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sabedeſ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and receiving t)be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">permanent additions</span><span class="font0"> of the ſtreams </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g a,&nbsp;h b, i c, k d, le,</span><span class="font0"> and that its velocity and ſlope in all&nbsp;its parts are ſo ſuited to the tenacity of the ſoil and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">►</span><span class="font0"> magnitude of its ſection, that neither do its w aters during the annual frtſhes tear up its banks or deepen its&nbsp;bed, nor do they bring down from the high lands materials which they depolit in the channel in times of&nbsp;ſmaller velocity. Such a riveç may be ſaid to be in a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">permanentſlate,</span><span class="font0"> to be in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conſervntion,</span><span class="font0"> or to have</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jlability.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Let us call this ſtate of a river fits regimen, denoting&nbsp;by the word the proper adjuſtment of the velocity of&nbsp;the ſtream to the tenacity of the channel. Ί he velocity of its regimen muſt be the ſame throughout, becauſe it is this which regulates its action on the bottom,&nbsp;which is the ſame from its head to the ſea. That its&nbsp;bed may have ſtability, the mean velocity of the current&nbsp;muſt be conſtant, notwithſtanding the inequality of diſcharge through its different fictions by the brocks&nbsp;which it receives in its courſe, and notwithſtanding the&nbsp;augmentation of its ſection as it approaches the ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, it behoved this exact regimen to commence at the mouth of the river, by the working&nbsp;of the whole body of the river, in concert with the waters of the ocean, which always keep within the fame&nbsp;limits, and make the ultimate level invariable. This&nbsp;working will begin to dig the bed, giving it as little&nbsp;breadth as poſſible : for this working conſiſts chiefly in&nbsp;the efforts of falls and rapid llreâms, which ariſe of&nbsp;themſelves in every channel which has too much ſlope.&nbsp;<sup>r</sup>l he bottom deepens, and the ſides remain very ſteep,&nbsp;till they, are undermined and crumble down ; and being-then diluted in the water, they are carried down the&nbsp;ſtream, and depoſited where the ocean checks its ſpeed.&nbsp;The banks crumble down anew, the valley or hollow&nbsp;forms ; but the ſection, always confined to its bottom,&nbsp;cannot acquire a great breadth, and it retains a good&nbsp;deal of the form of the trapezium formerly mentioned.&nbsp;In this manner does the regimen begin to be eſtabliſhed&nbsp;from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span></p>
