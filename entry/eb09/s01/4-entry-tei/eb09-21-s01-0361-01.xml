Before the opening of the Smyrna-Aidin railway its excellent roadstead was largely frequented by vessels trading with the Anatolian coast, and it has often been proposed to connect it with this system by a branch line, and thus enable it to compete with Smyrna as a trading centre. The population is estimated at 7000 to 10,000, of whom about 3000 are Greeks.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
