<p><span class="font2">configned them. </span><span class="font1">A pretty good edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Pieces</span><span class="font1"> appeared at Paris in 1741, in a ſmall 12mo&nbsp;volume. His portrait, engraved by the celebrated&nbsp;Aved, his old friend, made its appearance in 1778,&nbsp;with the following motto from Martial :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Certior in ηoβro carmine vultus grit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rousseau (John-James), was born at Geneva June 28. 17 12. Plis father was by prdfeſſion a clock and&nbsp;watch maker. At his birth, which, he ſays, was the&nbsp;firſt of his misfortunes, he endangered the life of his&nbsp;mother, and he himſelf was for a long time after in a&nbsp;very weak and languiſhing ſtate of health ; but as his&nbsp;bodily' ſtrength increaſed, his mental powers gradually&nbsp;opened, and afforded the happſeſt preſages of future&nbsp;greatnefs. His father, who was a citizen of Geneva,&nbsp;was a well-informed tradeſman ; and in the place where&nbsp;he wrought he kept a Plutarch and a Tacitus, and&nbsp;theſe authors of courſe ſoon became familiar to his&nbsp;ſon. A raſh juvenile ſtep occaſioned his leaving his&nbsp;father’s houſe. “ Finding himſelf a fugitive, in a&nbsp;ſtrange country, and without money or friends, he&nbsp;changed (ſays he himſelf) his religion, in order to&nbsp;procure a ſubſiſtence.” Bornex, biſhop of Anneci,&nbsp;from whom he fought an aſylum, committed the care&nbsp;of his education to Madame de Warrens, an ingenious&nbsp;and amiable lady, who hſtd in 1726 left part of her&nbsp;wealth, and the Proteſtant religion, in order to throw&nbsp;herſelf into the boſom of the church. This generous&nbsp;lady ſerved in the triple capacity of a mother, a friend,&nbsp;and a lover, to the new proſelyte, whom ſhe regarded&nbsp;as her ſon. Hie neceſſity of procuring for himſelf&nbsp;ſome ſettlement, however, or perhaps his unſettled diſ-poſition, obliged Rouffeau often to leave this tendhr&nbsp;mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He poffeffed more than ordinary talents for muſic ; and the Abbé Blanchard flattered his hopes with a&nbsp;place in the royal chapel, which he, however, failed&nbsp;in obtaining for him ; he was therefore under the neceſſity of teaching muſic at Chamberi. He remained&nbsp;in this place till 1741, in which year he went to Paris,&nbsp;where he w<sup>r</sup>as long in very deſtitute circumſtances.&nbsp;Writing to a friend in 1743, he thus exprefſes himſelf:&nbsp;*<sup>,</sup> Every thing is dear here, but eſpecially bread.”&nbsp;What an expreſſion ; and to what may not genius be&nbsp;reduced ! Meanwhile he now began to emerge from&nbsp;that obſcurity in which he had hitherto been buried.&nbsp;His friends placed him with M. de Montaigu, ambaſe&nbsp;ſador from France to Venice. According to his own&nbsp;confeſſion, a proud miſanthropy and a peculiar contempt of the riches and pleaſures of this world, conſtituted the chief traits in his character, and a miſun-derſtanding ſoon took place between him and the am-baffador. The place of depute, under M. Dupin, farmer-general, a man of conſiderable parts, gave him ſome&nbsp;temporary relief, and enabled him to be of ſome benefit to Madam de Warrens his former benefactreſs. lhe&nbsp;year 17 ςo was the commencement of his literary career.&nbsp;The academy of Dijon had propoſed the following&nbsp;queſtion : “ Whether the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∣ evival</span><span class="font1"> of the arts and&nbsp;ſciences has contributed to the refinement of manners?”&nbsp;Rouffeau at fiiſt inclined to ſupport the affirmative.&nbsp;« This is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pons aβ'dorum</span><span class="font1"> (ſays a phιlυlopher, at that&nbsp;time a friend of his), take the negative fide of∖the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">queſtion, </span><span class="font1">and I’ll promiſe you the greateſt ſucceſs,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His diſcourſe againſt the ſciences, accordingly, having been found to be the beſt written, and replete with the dcepeſt reaſoning, was publicly crowned with&nbsp;the approbation of that learned body. Never was a&nbsp;paradox ſupported with more eloquence ; it was not&nbsp;however a,</span><span class="font0">nt- </span><span class="font1">one; but he enriched it with all the&nbsp;advantages which either knowledge or genius could&nbsp;confer on it. Immediately after its appearance, he&nbsp;met with ſeveral opponents of<sup>z</sup>his tenets, which he de-fended ; and from one diſpute to another, he found&nbsp;himſelf involved in a formidable train of correſpon-deπce, without having ever almoſt dreamed of ſuch oppoſition. From that period he decreaſed in happineſs&nbsp;as he increaſed in celebrity. His “ Diſcourſe on the&nbsp;cauſes of inequality among mankind, and on the origin of ſocial compacts,” a work full of almoſt unintelligible maxims and wild ideas, was written with a&nbsp;view to prove that mankind are equal ; that they were&nbsp;born to live apart from each other ; and that they have&nbsp;perverted the order of nature in forming ſocieties. He&nbsp;bellows the higheſt praiie on the ſtate of nature, and&nbsp;depreciates the idea of every ſocial compact. This&nbsp;dilcourſe, and eſpecially the dedication of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it to</span><span class="font1"> the republic of Geneva, are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chef-Lœuvres</span><span class="font1"> of that kind of&nbsp;eloquence of which the ancients alone had given us&nbsp;any idea. By preſenting this performance to the ma-giſtrates, he was received again into his native country, and reinſtated in all the privileges and rights of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">citizen, after having with much difficulty prevailed on&nbsp;himſelf to abjure the Catholic religion. He ſoon, however, returned to France, and lived for ſome time in Paris. He afterwards gave himſelf up to retirement, to&nbsp;eſeape the ſhafts of criticiſm, and follow after the regimen which the ſtrangury, with which he was tormented, demanded of him. This is an important epoch in&nbsp;the hiilory of his life, as it is owing to this circum-ftance, perhaps, that we have the moſt elegant works&nbsp;that have come from his pen. His “ Letter to M.&nbsp;d’Alembert” on the deſign of erecting a theatre at&nbsp;Geneva, written in his retirement, and publiſhed in‘&nbsp;1757, contains, along with ſome paradoxes, ſome very&nbsp;important and well-handled truths. This letter firſt&nbsp;drew down upon him the envy of Voltaire, and was&nbsp;the cauſe of thoſe indignities with which that author&nbsp;never ceaſed to load him. What is fingular in him, is,&nbsp;that althouglι ſo great an enemy to theatrical reprefen--tations himſelf, he cauſed a comedy to be printed, and&nbsp;in 1752 gave to the theatre a paſtoral (The Village&nbsp;Conjuror), of which he compoſed both the poetry and&nbsp;muſic, both of them abounding with ſentiment and elegance, and full of innocent and rural ſimplicity. What&nbsp;renders the Village Conjuror highly delightful to perſons of taſte, is that perfect harmony of words and muſic&nbsp;which everywhere pervades it ; that proper connection&nbsp;among the parties who compoſe it ; and its being perfectly correct from beginning to end. The muſician&nbsp;hath ſpoken, hath thought, and felt like a poet. Everything in it is agreeable, interefting, and far ſuperior to&nbsp;thole common affected and inſipid productions of our&nbsp;modern petit-oramas. His Dictionary of Muſic affords ſeveral excellent articles; ſome of them, however,&nbsp;are very inaccurate. “ This work (ſays M. la Borde),&nbsp;in his Effay on Muſic, has need to be written over&nbsp;again, to fave much trouble to thoſe who wiſh to ſtudy&nbsp;it, </span><span class="font2">arid prevent them from falling into errors, </span><span class="font1">which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
