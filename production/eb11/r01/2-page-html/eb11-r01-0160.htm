<p><span class="font1">chapel of S. Pier Crisologo in the archiepiscopal palace preserves its original mosaics, and so also does the tomb of Galla Placidia (SS. Nazario e Celso), a small structure in the form of&nbsp;a Latin cross with a dome (in which, as in the baptistery of&nbsp;Neon, the old cathedral, &amp;c., the constructional use of amphorae&nbsp;is noteworthy), with a plain brick exterior, and rich mosaics&nbsp;on a dark blue ground within. The sarcophagus of Galla&nbsp;Placidia has, like the two others that stand here, been despoiled&nbsp;of its contents. The altar, like that at S. Vitale, is made of&nbsp;thin slabs of alabaster, behind which lamps were intended to&nbsp;be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S. Francesco, as it has been called since 1261, when it came into the possession of the Franciscans, has been almost entirely&nbsp;modernized, except for the crypt and campanile (nth century).&nbsp;The baptistery adjacent to the cathedral was, according to&nbsp;Ricci, originally part of the Roman baths, converted to a&nbsp;Christian baptistery by the Archbishop Neon (449-452), though according to other authorities it is a Christian building dating&nbsp;from before a.d. 396. It is an octagon, with a dome; in the&nbsp;interior are two arcades one above the other. The mosaics&nbsp;of the 5th century, in the dome, are the earliest and perhaps the&nbsp;finest at Ravenna for their splendid decorative effect and rich&nbsp;colouring, and are less stiff and conventional than the later&nbsp;mosaics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of S. Giovanni Battista, also erected in this period, hardly anything remains after the restoration of 1683, and S. Croce&nbsp;has been overtaken by a similar fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the death of Valentinian III. the activity in building for which Ravenna had been so remarkable suffered a check;&nbsp;but the reign of Theodoric (493-526) marks another era of&nbsp;magnificence. In the eastern part of the city he built for himself&nbsp;a large palace, which probably occupied about a sixth of the&nbsp;space now enclosed within the city walls, or nearly the whole of&nbsp;the rectangle enclosed by Strada di Porta Alberoni on the south,&nbsp;Strada Nuova di Porta Serrata on the west and the line of the&nbsp;city walls on the north and east. There still remains close to the&nbsp;first-named street and fronting the Corso Garibaldi a high wall&nbsp;built of square Roman bricks, with pillars and arched recesses&nbsp;in the upper portion, which goes by the name of Palazzo di&nbsp;Teodorico. Freeman, on account of the Romanesque character&nbsp;of the architecture, thought it probable that it really belongs to&nbsp;the time of the Lombard kings, and his opinion is shared by&nbsp;Ricci «and Rivoira, who consider it to be a guardhouse erected&nbsp;by the exarchs, recent explorations having made it clear that&nbsp;it was an addition to the palace, while mosaic pavements and&nbsp;an atrium once surrounded by arcades really belonging to the&nbsp;latter were found in 1870 behind S. Apollinare Nuovo and in&nbsp;1908 behind the so-called Palazzo at a lower level and a different&nbsp;orientation. A mosaic in the church of S. Apollinare Nuovo&nbsp;gives some faint idea of the palace. A more memorable and&nbsp;clearly authentic monument of Theodoric is furnished by his&nbsp;tomb, a massive mausoleum which stands still perfect outside&nbsp;the walls near the north-east corner of the city. It is circular&nbsp;internally and decagonal externally, in two storeys, built of&nbsp;marble blocks, and surmounted by an enormous monolith,&nbsp;brought from the quarries of Istria and weighing more than&nbsp;300 tons. The plan is no doubt derived from that of a Roman&nbsp;tomb. In this mausoleum Theodoric was buried, but his body&nbsp;was cast forth from it, perhaps during the troublous times of&nbsp;the siege of Ravenna by the imperial troops, and the Rotunda&nbsp;(as it is now generally called) was converted into a church&nbsp;dedicated to the Virgin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S. Apollinare Nuovo, the most important basilica in the town, was built by Theodoric to be the largest of Arian churches,&nbsp;and originally called S. Martino in Coelo Aureo (a name which it&nbsp;lost in the 9th century). The exterior is uninteresting, and the&nbsp;church lost both atrium and apse in the 16th century. The&nbsp;interior has twenty-four columns of marble (from Constantinople&nbsp;according to some, from Rome according to others), with almost&nbsp;uniform capitals. The walls of the nave are adorned with&nbsp;mosaics of the 6th century; the scenes from the New Testament&nbsp;above the windows date from the time of Theodoric, while the&nbsp;somewhat stiff processions below, of virgins on one side and of&nbsp;saints on the other, are substitutions of the latter half of the&nbsp;6th century for representations which probably contained some&nbsp;allusion to Arianism or episodes in the life of Theodoric (so Ricci).&nbsp;The mosaics have been in parts much restored; but the earher&nbsp;ones still show, like those which preceded them in Ravenna,&nbsp;classical forms, variety of treatment and freedom of colouring,&nbsp;while the processions are monotonous and inferior in execution,&nbsp;intended rather to produce a decorative effect than beauty of&nbsp;form. The pulpit appears to be of Byzantine origin (Rivoira).&nbsp;The campanile (850-878) is circular, and has perhaps the earliest&nbsp;example of the use of disks of coloured majolica as a decoration.&nbsp;This, like the other campanili of Ravenna, is later than the&nbsp;church to which it belongs. Those of the cathedral of S.&nbsp;Apollinare in Classe, S. Maria Maggiore and S. Agata, also&nbsp;circular, probably belong also to the 9th century, while the two&nbsp;square campanili of S. Giovanni Evangelista and S. Francesco&nbsp;probably belong to the early nth century. The other churches&nbsp;erected by Theodoric are: S. Teodoro (or S. Spirito), erected&nbsp;by Theodoric for the Arian bishops, but entirely modified: the&nbsp;baptistery of this church (afterwards the oratory of S. Maria in&nbsp;Cosmedin) formed out of the octagonal hall of a Roman bath (?)&nbsp;—unless it is an originally Christian building—with mosaics of&nbsp;the 6th century imitating those of the baptistery of Neon, and&nbsp;freely restored; S. Maria Maggiore, founded by the Archbishop&nbsp;Ecclesius (521-534), but almost entirely rebuilt; and S. Vittore,&nbsp;which has suffered a similar fate. To the same period probably&nbsp;belong a few columns of the so-called Basilica of Heracles in the&nbsp;Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, with capitals like those of S. Apolli-nare in Classe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The impulse given by Theodoric was continued by his successors, and during the regency of Amalasuntha and the&nbsp;reigns of Theodatus and Vitiges (526-539), S. Vitale and S.&nbsp;Apollinare in Classe were constructed by Julius Argentarius&nbsp;contemporaneously with S. Lorenzo in Milan and the cathedral&nbsp;of Parenzo—also S. Michele in Africisco, nothing of the original&nbsp;structure of which now exists. The former, well restored by&nbsp;Ricci in 1898-1900 (except for the dome with its baroque frescoes&nbsp;which has not been altered), is a regular octagon, with a vestibule,&nbsp;originally flanked by two towers on the west, a choir added on the&nbsp;east, triangular outside and circular within; it is surrounded&nbsp;within by two galleries interrupted at the presbytery, and&nbsp;supported by eight large pillars, the intervals between which are&nbsp;occupied by open exedrae. The mosaics of the choir (547) are&nbsp;due to Justinian, and, though inferior in style, are remarkable&nbsp;for their splendour of colouring and the gorgeous dresses of the&nbsp;persons represented, and also for their historical interest, especially the scenes representing the emperor and the empress&nbsp;Theodora presenting offerings. The marble screens of the&nbsp;altar are wonderfully finely carved. The marble mosaic pavement (nth century) is very effective. Remains of the original&nbsp;marble wall lining and stucco decoration also exist. The&nbsp;capitals are, in the lower order, the characteristic funnel-shaped&nbsp;rectangular Byzantine capitals, some of them with open work,&nbsp;bearing cushions; this is a type probably derived from the&nbsp;cushion itself, and developed in the East about the second half&nbsp;of the 5th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The architecture of S. Vitale (for plan see Architecture, sect. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Early Christian</span><span class="font1">), according to Rivoira, was inspired not by&nbsp;Byzantium, where similar churches—S. Sofia and SS. Sergio and&nbsp;Bacco—are slightly later in date, but by the churches of&nbsp;Salonica (a.d. 495), while the plan is derived from a Christian&nbsp;baptistery, or from such a building </span><span class="font0">as </span><span class="font1">the so-called temple of&nbsp;Minerva Medica at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S. Apollinare in Classe, erected at the same time outside the walls of Classis, and now standing by itself in the lonely marshes,&nbsp;is the largest basilica existing at Ravenna. It has a nave and&nbsp;aisles with a closed vestibule on the west, and a fine round&nbsp;campanile of the 9th (?) century. The exterior brick walls are&nbsp;divided by shallow arches and pilasters, as in other churches of&nbsp;Ravenna. It has twenty-four columns of Carystian (cipollino)&nbsp;marble, with capitals probably of Byzantine work with swelling</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
