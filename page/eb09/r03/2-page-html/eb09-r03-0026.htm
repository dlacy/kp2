Leo’s son, Constantinus Porphyro-genitus, made an addition to it in the shape of an official commentary collected from the writings of the 6th-century jurists, the&nbsp;so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lAapdypafpai </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">tuv</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> iraXaiuv,</span><span class="font2"> which is now spoken of as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">scholia</span><span class="font2"> to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica,</span><span class="font2"> and has done good exegetical service for&nbsp;modern civilians. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica</span><span class="font2"> retained its statutory authority&nbsp;until the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453. But long before&nbsp;that it had practically been abandoned ; and not a single complete&nbsp;copy of it exists. Its place was taken by epitomes and compendia,&nbsp;the last being the E$d/3t/3\os of Constantinus Harmenopulus of 1345,&nbsp;“a miserable epitome of the epitomes of epitomes,” as Bruns calls&nbsp;it, which survived the vicissitudes of the centuries, and finally&nbsp;received statutory authority in the modern kingdom of Greece in&nbsp;the year 1835, in place of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica,</span><span class="font2"> which had been sanctioned&nbsp;thirteen years before, in 1822.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Their Fate in the West. —</span><span class="font2">Before the rise of the Bologna school it was to a much greater extent from the Romano-barbarian codes&nbsp;than from the books of Justinian that central and western Europe&nbsp;derived their acquaintance with Roman law. Theodoric’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edict&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">can have had little influence after Justinian’s recovery of Italy,&nbsp;and the Romano-Burgundian law was no doubt gradually displaced&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Breviary {Lex Rom. Fisigothorum}</span><span class="font2"> after Burgundy had fallen&nbsp;into the hands of the Franks ; but the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Breviary</span><span class="font2"> itself found its way&nbsp;in all directions in France and Germany, penetrating even into&nbsp;England, to a great extent through the agency of the church.&nbsp;There must, however, have been other repertories of Roman law&nbsp;in circulation, as witness a testament made in Paris in the end&nbsp;of the 7th century, preserved by Mabillon, in which the testator&nbsp;uses the old formula of theyiis </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">civile,—</span><span class="font2">“ita do, ita lego, ita testor,&nbsp;ita vos Quirites testimonium mihi perhibetote,”—words that are&nbsp;not to be found either in the Visigothic or the Justinianian&nbsp;collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In his pragmatic sanction of the year 554 Justinian anew accorded his imperial sanction to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jura</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">leges, i.e.,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> which he says he had long before transmitted to Italy,&nbsp;at the same time declaring that his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels</span><span class="font2"> were to be of the same&nbsp;authority there as in the East. Two years after this came Julian’s&nbsp;Latin epitome of them, not improbably prepared by command of&nbsp;the emperor himself. That they all came at once to some extent&nbsp;into use is beyond question ; for there is preserved in Marini’s&nbsp;collection the testament of one Mannanes, executed at Ravenna in&nbsp;the reign of Justinian’s immediate successor Justin II., in which&nbsp;the requirements of both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels</span><span class="font2"> are scrupulously observed.&nbsp;Of other monuments of the same period that prove the currency of&nbsp;the Justinianian law in Italy several are referred to by Savigny in&nbsp;the second volume of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Roman Law in the Middle&nbsp;Ages,</span><span class="font2"> among which may be mentioned the Turin gloss of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font2"> which Fitting ascribes to about the year 545, and two little&nbsp;pieces known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dictatum de consiliariis</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Collectio de&nbsp;tutoribus,</span><span class="font2"> which form an appendix to some manuscripts of Julian’s&nbsp;epitome of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font2"> and may possibly have been from his pen.&nbsp;The invasion of the Lombards, the disturbance they caused in Italy&nbsp;for two centuries, and the barrier they formed between it and the rest&nbsp;of Europe militated against the spread of the Justinianian law northwards ; but it was taught without much interruption in Ravenna,&nbsp;the seat of the exarchs; to which (but this is doubtful) the school&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{studium}</span><span class="font2"> of Rome, revived by Justinian, is said to have been transferred. By the Lombards, as their savagery toned down, the Roman</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I</span><span class="font3">T would be impossible within the limits allowed for this article to attempt, even in outline, any history&nbsp;of the course of Roman literature which would include&nbsp;an account, not only of the extant works which it contains and of their authors, but also of the principal works&nbsp;and writers known to us from ancient testimony. The&nbsp;mere enumeration of these in chronological order, without&nbsp;some attempt to ascertain their individual features and to&nbsp;estimate their relation to the intellectual movement of&nbsp;their time, could be of no interest or use to any one. All&nbsp;that is possible to accomplish here is to pass in rapid&nbsp;review the first four of the five periods into which Roman&nbsp;literature may most conveniently be divided, to ascertain&nbsp;the chief literary motives and characteristics of each, and&nbsp;to connect these with the works and writers in whom they</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">law was so far recognized that they allowed it to be applied to the Romans living within their territory; and it is said to have even&nbsp;been taught in Pavia, which they had established as their capital.&nbsp;Their overthrow by Charlemagne opened an outlet for it beyond&nbsp;Italy; and in the 9th century there is evidence that the Justinianian books or some of them were already circulating in the hands&nbsp;of the clergy in various parts of Europe. Yet there are very few&nbsp;remains of any literature indicating much acquaintance with them.&nbsp;Almost the only pieces worth mentioning are the so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Summa&nbsp;Perusina,</span><span class="font2"> an abridgment of the first eight books of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> ascribed&nbsp;to the 9th century; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quaestiones ac monita,</span><span class="font2"> to the Lombardic&nbsp;laws, drawn mostly from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font2"> but with a few texts from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> and Julian’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Epitome,</span><span class="font2"> and supposed to have&nbsp;been written early in the 11th century; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brachylogus,</span><span class="font2"> an&nbsp;abbreviated revision of Justinian’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font2"> with references to&nbsp;his other books, which is thought to have been written in France&nbsp;(Orleans?), according to Fitting between 999 and 1002, but according to other authorities nearer the end of the 11th century; and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petri exceptiones legum Romanarum,</span><span class="font2"> a systematic exposition&nbsp;of the law in four books, written in-the south of France early in&nbsp;the latter half of the 11th century, and mostly compiled from&nbsp;Justinianian sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was in the very end of the 11th century or the beginning of the 12th that at Bologna, and under one Irnerius, who appears not&nbsp;to have been a professional jurist but originally a teacher of letters,&nbsp;the study of Roman law began somewhat suddenly to attract&nbsp;students from all parts of the world. Through the action of the&nbsp;clergy the only parts of the Justinianian legislation that had hitherto&nbsp;been in ordinary use were the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The first, from its elementary character, had naturally commended&nbsp;itself; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> with its opening title on the Trinity and its second&nbsp;on Holy Church, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font2"> with their abundant legislation&nbsp;on matters ecclesiastical, were in many respects charters of the&nbsp;church’s privileges, and were prized accordingly; but the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">as being the work of pagan jurists, had been practically ignored.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font2"> however, with their modicum of wheat&nbsp;concealed in such a quantity of chaff, offered little attraction to&nbsp;laymen of intelligence ; and, when a copy of a portion of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">with its infinitely purer diction and its clear and incisive reasoning,&nbsp;came into the hands of Irnerius, it must have been for him as a&nbsp;new revelation. The text of it seems to have reached him by instalments ; at least this is the only reasonable explanation of its&nbsp;division by the glossarists (as Irnerius and his successors of the&nbsp;Bologna school were called, the name being derived from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">glossae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">notes marginal and interlinear, with which they furnished it) into&nbsp;three parts, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digestum Fetus</span><span class="font2"> (books 1 to 24, tit. 2), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Infortiatum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digestum Novum</span><span class="font2"> (book 39 to the end), the general idea being&nbsp;that, after first the old and then the new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font2"> had come to light,&nbsp;the connecting link unexpectedly turned up, and got in consequence the somewhat singular name by which it continued to be&nbsp;known for centuries. The whole collection was by the glossarists&nbsp;distributed in five volumes, the fourth containing the first nine&nbsp;books of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font2"> and the fifth, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Folumen parvum legum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">containing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font2"> a Latin translation of 134 of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Novels&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Authenticum,</span><span class="font2"> and the last three books of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Code&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which had been recovered subsequently to the others. With these&nbsp;five volumes, the teaching that accompanied them, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">glossae,&nbsp;summae, casus, brocarda,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c., with which they were enriched from&nbsp;the rise of the school with Irnerius till its close with Franciscus&nbsp;Accursius in 1260, Roman jurisprudence began a new career, which&nbsp;it would carry us beyond the limits of this article to attempt to&nbsp;trace even in meagrest outline.@@<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J.
