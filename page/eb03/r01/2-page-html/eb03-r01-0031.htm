<p><span class="font3">R</span><span class="font2">ANA,the frog, in zoology; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">genus belongingto the order of amphibia reptilia. The body is naked,&nbsp;furniſhed with four feet, and without any tail. Therc&nbsp;are 17 ſpecics. The moſt remarkable are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i. </span><span class="font2">The temporaria, or common frog. This is an&nbsp;animal ſo well known, that it needs no defcription; but&nbsp;ſome of its properties are veιy ſingular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Its fpring, or power of taking large leaps, is re-markably great, and it is the beſt ſwimmer of all four-footed animals. Nature hath finely adapted its parts for thofe ends, the fore members of 'the body being very&nbsp;lightly made, the hind legs and thighs very long, and&nbsp;furniſhed with very ſtrong mufcles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">while in a tadpole ſtate, it is entirely a water animal ; the work of generation is performed in that ele-χr&gt;ent, as may be ſeen in every pond during ſpring, when the female remains oppreſſed by the male for a&nbsp;number of days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of propagation is extremely ſingular, it be-ing certain that the frog has not a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">penis intrans.</span><span class="font2"> There appears a ſtrong analogy in this caſe between a certain claſs of the vegetable kingdom and thoſe animals ;&nbsp;for it is well known, that when the female frog depofits its ſpawn, the male inſtantaneouſly impregnates it&nbsp;with what we may call a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſarina f∑cundcms,</span><span class="font2"> in the ſame&nbsp;manner as the palm-tree conveys fructification to the&nbsp;flowers of the female, which would otherwiſe be barren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As ſoon as the frogs are releaſed from their tadpole ſtate, they immediately take to land ; and if the weather has been hot, and there fall any reſreihing ſhowers,&nbsp;you may fee the ground for a confiderable ſpace perfectly blackened by myriads of theſe animalcules, ſeek-ing ſor ſome ſecure lurking places. Some philoſo-phers, not giving themſelves time to examine into this&nbsp;phenomenon, imagined them to have been generated&nbsp;in the clouds, and ſhowered on the earth ; but had&nbsp;they, like our Derham, but traced them to the next&nbsp;pool, they would have found a better folution of the&nbsp;difficulty. See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preternatural RAiNs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As frogs adhere cloſely to the backs of their own fpecies, ſo we know they will do the ſame by fiſh.—&nbsp;walton mentions a ſtrange ſtory of their deſtroying&nbsp;pike ; but that they will injure, if not entirely kill&nbsp;carp, is a fact ⅛difputable, ſrom the following rela-tion. Not many years ago, on fiſhing a pond belong-ing to Mr Pitt of Encomb, Dorſetſhire, great numbers&nbsp;of the carp were found each with a frog mounted on it,&nbsp;the hind legs clinging to the back, and the fore legs&nbsp;fixed in the corner of each eye of the fiſh, which were&nbsp;thin and greatly wafted, teized by carrying ſo diſagrce-able a load. 1 heſe frogs Mr Pennant ſuppoſes to lιave&nbsp;been males diſapppointed of a mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The croaking of frogs is well known ; and from that in fenny countries they are diſtinguiſhed by ludicrous&nbsp;titles : thus they are ſtyled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch nightingales,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Boſ-ton waites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yet there is a time </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the year when they become mute, neither croaking nor opening their mouths for a&nbsp;whole month : this happens in the hot ſeaſon, and that&nbsp;is in many places known to the country people by tbe&nbsp;name of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">paddock moon.</span><span class="font2"> It is ſaid, that during that&nbsp;period their mouths are ſo cloſed, that no force (without killing the animal) will be capable of opening&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thefe, as well as other reptiles, feed but a final! ſpace of the year. The food of this genus is flies, in-ſects, and fnails. Toads are ſaid to feed alſo on bees,&nbsp;and to do great injury to thoſe uſeful infects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During winter, frogs and toads remain in a torpid ſtate : the laſt of which will dig into the earth, and cover themſelves with almoſt the ſame agility as the&nbsp;mole. See Physiology, n<sup>0</sup>48 and note (b), and ſh 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eſculenta, or edible frog, differs from the&nbsp;former, in having a high protuberance in the middle&nbsp;of the back, forming a very ſharp angle. Its colours&nbsp;are alſo more vivid, and its marks more diſtinct ; the&nbsp;ground colour being a pale or yellowiſh green, marked&nbsp;with rows of black ſpots from the head to the rump.—.&nbsp;This, and (Mr Pennant thinks) the former, are eaten.&nbsp;He has feen in the markets at Paris whole hampers&nbsp;full, which the venders were preparing for the tab!e, by&nbsp;fkinning and cutting off the fore-parts, the loins and&nbsp;legs only being kept ; but his ſtrong diſlike to theſc&nbsp;reptiles prevented a cloſe exanſhiatioa into the ſpecies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country of Pennſylvania, and fome other&nbsp;parts of North America, there is a very large ſpecies of&nbsp;frogs called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bullfrog,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rana ocellatd.</span><span class="font2"> Their irides&nbsp;arc of a duſky red, ſurrounded with a yellow ring. The&nbsp;auricles are covered with a thin circular ſkin, which&nbsp;forms a ſpot behind each eye. They have four toes on&nbsp;the fore-feet, and five palmated toes behind. Their co-lour is a duſky brown, mixed with yellowiſh green, and&nbsp;fpotted with black. The belly is yellowiſh, and faintly&nbsp;fpotted. Theſe make a monſtrous roaring noiſe like </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">bull, only ſomewhat ſhore hoarſe. Their fize is ſuperior&nbsp;to that of any other of the genus, and they can ſpring&nbsp;forward three yards at a leap. By this means they will&nbsp;equal in fpecd a very good horſe in its ſwiſteſt couiſſe.&nbsp;Their places of abode are ponds, or bogs with ſtagnant&nbsp;water ; but they never frequent ſtreams. when many</span></p>
