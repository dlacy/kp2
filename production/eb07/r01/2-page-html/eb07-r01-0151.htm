<p><span class="font0">after the manner of fishes, from spawn-like ova., they possess for a time the essential characters of the finny race ; and yet, on the lapse of a few brief weeks, their pisciform&nbsp;appearance vanishes, and leaving the water, they crawl&nbsp;or leap about upon the earth, or climbing the stems of&nbsp;forest trees, they dwell among the umbrageous branches.&nbsp;In some the transition state, if we may say so, continues&nbsp;permanent, the gills existing simultaneously with feeble&nbsp;lungs, and a tail being combined with short external members. Of the structure of these curious animals more will&nbsp;be said hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ovum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">egg</span><span class="font0"> of these reptiles is a round mass of transparent nutritive jelly, in the centre of which appears&nbsp;a small black globule. By degrees this shapeless globule&nbsp;exhibits the appearance of a head and tail, and in this state&nbsp;it emerges from its prison, and moves about briskly in the water. It is provided with a long fleshy tail, and a small horny&nbsp;beak, and has no other visible member, except two feathery&nbsp;tufts on the sides of the neck, which float loosely, and without protection, in the surrounding fluid. These, however,&nbsp;are mere temporary organs ; for they serve the purpose of&nbsp;respiration only until the proper gills are formed, and then&nbsp;shrink or disappear. @@<sup>1</sup> The true gills or branchiæ are contained within the body, three or four in number on each side,&nbsp;constructed on a plan similar to those of fishes ; the water entering by the mouth, and escaping in some species by two&nbsp;openings, and in others by one only. Retaining their aquatic constitution, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tadpoles</span><span class="font0"> (as in this intermediate state&nbsp;they are often called) rapidly increase in size and activity tor&nbsp;some weeks. In the mean time the legs, of which no trace&nbsp;was at first apparent, have commenced their growth. The&nbsp;hind ones are the first to make their appearance externally,&nbsp;although the anterior pair are as soon developed, and may&nbsp;be seen at an early period folded beneath their transparent&nbsp;covering. The animal at this period wears a very ambiguous appearance, partaking both of the form of the frog and&nbsp;lizard, and swimming as well by the inflection of the tail as&nbsp;by the irregular impulse of the feet. @@<sup>2</sup> At this time the beak&nbsp;falls off, and the true jaws, which originally were hid under&nbsp;the skin, appear. The eye, too, which had been seen only&nbsp;through a transparent spot in the tadpole’s skin, appears&nbsp;complete and prominent. This interval is also employed&nbsp;in acquiring the faculty of respiring atmospheric air. The&nbsp;animal every now and then rises to the surface and takes&nbsp;a mouthful of air, which is received into the newly formed&nbsp;lungs, and then discharged. When the necessary internal&nbsp;changes are at length completed, the tail, which has now&nbsp;become a useless member, diminishes and disappears. The&nbsp;gills, too, have by this time shrunk, their function being superseded by the lungs, and the animal emerging from the&nbsp;water, begins a new mode of existence as a perfect reptile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During its aquatic state the tadpole lives principally on vegetable food, but in its perfect form much more upon&nbsp;various insects ; and there is a remarkable and corresponding change in its digestive organs, which assume the character of those of a carnivorous creature. Most of the&nbsp;Batrachia, we may also remark, are oviparous, whilst not&nbsp;a few of them are ovo-viviparous. It should, moreover,&nbsp;be observed, that most of the species of this group, during&nbsp;their aquatic condition, possess the extraordinary power of&nbsp;suffering the privation of a part, or the whole, of one or&nbsp;more of their members without vital injury, and of afterwards&nbsp;renewing them as if no loss had been endured ; a property of which we have already made mention in our summary&nbsp;account of lizards, and to which we may again briefly return&nbsp;in our notice of the aquatic salamander</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We shall now take a nearer view of the vascular and respiratory systems of these animals. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">circulation,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the tadpole state, is in every respect analogous to that of&nbsp;fishes : the blood is transmitted from a simple bilocular or&nbsp;tw<sup>τ</sup>o-lobed heart to the branchial arches, and, after </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aeration&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by the water, returns, and is circulated through the system.&nbsp;The transition from this condition to that which the vascular organs present in the perfect reptile state is very striking. Originally three or four branchial trunks pass off&nbsp;from each side of the heart, and terminate in the minute&nbsp;network of the gills ; from this network the returning vessels take their origin, one from each of the gills, the first&nbsp;of which goes to the head, and the other two conjoining,&nbsp;convey the blood to the rest of the system, as in fishes.&nbsp;But in addition to these vessels, there are some small undeveloped ones, which effect a communication between the&nbsp;vessels which go to the gills and those which return from&nbsp;them ; as also another which, given off from tile heart,&nbsp;unites with the aorta, to be distributed to the as yet rudimentary lungs. After the metamorphosis is begun, the&nbsp;branches which connect the arteries of the gills with the&nbsp;returning veins are greatly enlarged, so that a part of the&nbsp;blood flow's continuously through them without proceeding&nbsp;to the gills at all, and the proper branchial vessels relatively&nbsp;diminish ; and the last-named trunk, which was thc smallest of all, becomes the largest, and an increased proportion&nbsp;of blood is sent to the lungs. By a continuance of these&nbsp;changes, the branchial vessels are finally obliterated, and&nbsp;the communicating branches, at Arstonlysecondary and irregular, now constitute part of the continuous and permanent&nbsp;system of circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">respiration</span><span class="font0"> of the Batrachia, after they have arrived at their permanent mode of existence, is not less singular&nbsp;than their circulation ; and this chiefly in two particulars,—&nbsp;as it regards thc lungs, and the function of the skin. If we&nbsp;take a frog, for example, @@<sup>3</sup> and watch its respiration, we cannot readily discover that it breathes at all ; for it never opens&nbsp;its mouth to receive air, and there is no motion of the sides&nbsp;to indicate that it respires ; and yet, on any sudden alarm,&nbsp;we see the animal blowing itself up, as if by some internal&nbsp;power, though its mouth all the while continues closed.&nbsp;We may perceive, however, that its throat is in frequent&nbsp;motion, as if the frog were economizing its mouthful of air,&nbsp;and transferring it backwards and forwards between its&nbsp;mouth and lungs ; and if we direct our attention to the&nbsp;nostrils, we may observe in them a twisting motion at each&nbsp;movement of the jaws ; for it is through the nostrils that&nbsp;the frog receives all the air which it breathes. The jaws&nbsp;are never open but for the purpose of eating ; and the sides&nbsp;of the mouth form a sort of bellows, of which the nostrils</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change or conversion from external to internal gills is not very satisfactorily described by physiological observers. “ Dès&nbsp;le moment où les Batraciens sortent de l’œuf, ces branchies sont apparentes au dehors, elles représentent des espèces de franges ou&nbsp;de panaches colorés situés sur les parties latérales du cou, et attachés sur les bords des fentes qui correspond à la gorge ; elles persistes sous cette forme, dans tous les Batraciens qui conservent leur queue, tant que leurs poumons ne sont pas assez développés&nbsp;pour servir uniquement à la respiration. Dans les Grenouilles et autres genres voisins sans queue, le premier état ne dure que&nbsp;pendant un temps très court. Bientôt l'animal prend une autre forme, celle d’un têtard à ventre énorme confondu avec la tête et&nbsp;avec une longue queue. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les branchies sont alors cachées, et contenues dans une cavité ;</span><span class="font1"> l’eau arrive dans la bouche par les orifices des&nbsp;narines,  étc. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Erpétologie Générale,</span><span class="font1"> i. 182.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the great Lord Bacon had not practised his inductive philosophy so far as young frogs are concerned, for in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvu Syivartrn</span><span class="font1"> he makes mention of their being sometimes observed with tails, in such years as have been more than usually pestilential or unhealthy ; and he then draws tire conclusion that the appearance of such tailed reptiles, “ argueth agreat disposition to putrefaction in the soile and aire.</span></p>
