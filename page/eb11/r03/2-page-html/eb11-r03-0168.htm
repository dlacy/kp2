<p><span class="font0">If the latter course be followed, Mr Lyons’s genera must be reduced to the rank of sub-genera, and his sub-generic divisions of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvilagus</span><span class="font0"> ignored. (See Hare and Rabbit.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extinct Rodents</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among extinct rodents, only a few of the more important types may be noticed. As to the origin of the order, we are still to a&nbsp;great extent in the dark; and even the relations of the Duplicidentata&nbsp;to the Simplicidentata are not yet fully understood. With regard&nbsp;to the latter point, it is, however, considered probable that both&nbsp;are branches of a common stock, which diverged from each other&nbsp;before all the typical rodent characters were acquired. As to the&nbsp;ancestral stock of the order, it has been suggested that this is represented by certain Lower Eocene European and North American&nbsp;mammals, at one time regarded as primitive Primates. In Europe&nbsp;these include </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plesiadapis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protoadapis,</span><span class="font0"> and in North America&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mixodectes, Microsyops</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cynodontomys ;</span><span class="font0"> the last three constituting the family Mixodectidae. Possibly the European forms, in&nbsp;which the dental formula has been given as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font0"> 8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pi, m.</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;there is a gap between the incisors and the cheek-teeth, are more&nbsp;nearly related to modern rodents than the American types, and may&nbsp;indeed belong to the sa me order. On the other hand, the American&nbsp;forms, which have one pair of large chisel-like incisors in the lower&nbsp;jaw, also possess a lower canine, and show no marked gap in front&nbsp;of the cheek-teeth, nor any indication of the characteristic rodent&nbsp;backwards movement of the lower jaw. On these grounds, while&nbsp;admitting that they are allied to the rodents, it has been pointed&nbsp;out that they can scarcely be included in the Rodentia, and the&nbsp;order Proglires has in consequence been proposed for their reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whatever may be the true affinity of these problematical mammals, undoubted rodents are known from the Lower Eocene of both&nbsp;Europe and North America. In Europe these form the genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ischyrornys</span><span class="font0"> and the family Ischyromyidae, and have premolars f,&nbsp;and all the cheek-teeth low-crowned,, with simple cusps of ridges.&nbsp;Possibly they are akin to the Sciuridae. In America, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paramys,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with transversely ridged molars, is allied ; and the European </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciuromys&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">should perhaps find a place in the same neighbourhood. A more&nbsp;advanced phase is represented in the European Lower Oligocene&nbsp;by the Pseudosciuridae, with the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudosciurus, Sciuroides,&nbsp;Trechomys, Theridomys,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., in which part of the masseter passes&nbsp;through the broad infra-orbital canal, and the premolars are J;&nbsp;the molars being low-crowned, many-rooted and either cusped or&nbsp;ridged. These rodents are thought to be allied to the Anomaluridae;&nbsp;and it is partly on their evidence that the family Pedetidae is placed&nbsp;next the latter. Here it may be mentioned that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leithia,</span><span class="font0"> from the&nbsp;Pleistocene of Malta, originally regarded as a giant dormouse, seems&nbsp;near akin to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anomalurus.</span><span class="font0"> In the highly specialized mastoid region&nbsp;of the skull, the North American Oligocene </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protoptychus</span><span class="font0"> approaches&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dipopodornys,</span><span class="font0"> while the contemporary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gymnoptychus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">En-toptychus</span><span class="font0"> likewise appear referable to the Geomyidae. The Upper&nbsp;Oligocene </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cricetodon</span><span class="font0"> in Europe and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eurnys</span><span class="font0"> in America are the earliest&nbsp;known forerunners of the cricetine Muridae; while at the same time&nbsp;primitive beavers appear in the form of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stemeofiber,</span><span class="font0"> to be succeeded&nbsp;in the European Pleistocene by the gigantic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trogontherittm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The still larger North American Pleistocene </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castoroides,</span><span class="font0"> known by one species of the size of a bear, and the allied West Indian&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amblyrhiza,</span><span class="font0"> appear to be specialized beavers, although they have&nbsp;been referred to a family by themselves. Near akin is the North&nbsp;American Miocene family Mylagaulidae, typified by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mylagaulus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mesogaulus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protogaulus.</span><span class="font0"> Although showing&nbsp;some dental characters approximating to the porcupines, these&nbsp;rodents are regarded as allied to the Castoridae, although forming&nbsp;an isolated type. The prominent feature, writes Mr E. S. Riggs,&nbsp;is the unusual development of the premolar to the exclusion of the&nbsp;posterior teeth. Associated with this is the strength and sharpness&nbsp;of the lower jaw, the prominence and anterior position of the&nbsp;masseteric ridge, and the depth of the ramus from the alveolar line&nbsp;to the angle. These indicate unusual capacity for crushing or&nbsp;grinding; while the last premolar is a crushing implement, which&nbsp;has reached the highest degree of specialization knewn in Rodentia.&nbsp;It is suggested that these teeth may have been employed for cracking&nbsp;nuts or hard seeds, although also used for grinding. The remarkable&nbsp;North American </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ceratogaulus,</span><span class="font0"> with a large bony nasal horn, belongs&nbsp;to the same family. To discuss the remaining Miocene and later&nbsp;fossil Simplicidentata would be doing little more than adding to&nbsp;the generic names referable to the various existing families, lt&nbsp;may be mentioned, however, that the distribution of these later&nbsp;Tertiary types accords very closely with that of their existing relatives; the families of South American hystricoids being represented by a number of extinct genera in the formations of Argentina&nbsp;and Brazil. Special mention may be made of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Megamys,</span><span class="font0"> from the&nbsp;caves of Brazil, which, while apparently allied to the living viscacha,&nbsp;attained dimensions approximating to those of a hippopotamus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As regards the Duplicidentata, it appears that the families Ocho-tonidae and Leporidae had become differentiated as early as the Lower Miocene. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Titanomys</span><span class="font0"> is the earliest form, from the Middle&nbsp;Miocene, succeeded by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lagopsis,</span><span class="font0"> and then by the modern </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ochotona.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">In this line there is a tendency to lose the last upper molar, but in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prolagus,</span><span class="font0"> which ranges in the Pliocene from Sardinia and Corsica&nbsp;to Spain, and forms a side-branch, the corresponding lower tooth&nbsp;has likewise disappeared. In contradistinction to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Titanomys,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;which the cheek-teeth are rooted, is the North American Upper&nbsp;OIigocene </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palaeolagus,</span><span class="font0"> where they are rootless. . In general dental&nbsp;characters, especially the retention of three pairs of molars, this&nbsp;genus approximates to the Leporidae, although in the absence of&nbsp;post-orbital processes and the pattern of the molars it departs less&nbsp;widely from the modern Ochotonidae than does </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prolagus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RODERICK, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ruadri</span><span class="font0"> (d. 1198), king'of Connaught and high king of Ireland, was the son of TurIough (TordeIbach)&nbsp;O<sup>i</sup>Connor, king of Connaught, who had obtained the overkingship in 1151, but had lost it again in 1154 through the rise&nbsp;of Muirchertach O<sup>i</sup>Lochlainn in Ulster. Roderick succeeded&nbsp;to Connaught in 1156, and after ten years<sup>1</sup> fighting won back&nbsp;the title of high king. His ill-advised persecution of Dermot&nbsp;(Diarmait MacMurchada), king of Leinster, furnished the&nbsp;pretext for the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. Roderick&nbsp;endeavoured to expel the invaders, but was driven behind&nbsp;the Shannon. He delayed his submission to Henry II. until&nbsp;1175, when a treaty was concluded at Windsor. Roderick,&nbsp;under this agreement, held Connaught as the vassal of England,&nbsp;and exercised lordship over all the native kings and chiefs of&nbsp;Ireland; in return he undertook to pay an annual tribute. The&nbsp;treaty did not put an end to the wars of the Norman adventurers against Connaught and Roderick’s dependants. He held&nbsp;out till iiQi; but then, weary’ of strife, retired to the cloister.&nbsp;He died in Π98, the last of the high kings of Ireland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RODEZ, a town of southern France, capital of the department of Aveyron, 51 m. N.N.E. of Albi by rail. Pop. (1906) town,&nbsp;ir,076; commune, 15,502. Rodez is situated on the southern&nbsp;border of the Causse of Rodez, on an isolated plateau bordered&nbsp;on the E. and S. by the river Aveyron. The cathedral was&nbsp;built between 1277 and 1535. A great Flamboyant rose-window and a gallery in the same style are the chief features&nbsp;of the principal façade, which is flanked by two square towers&nbsp;and has no portal. Each transept has a fine Gothic doorway.&nbsp;On the north side of the building rises a tower (1510-1526) of&nbsp;imposing height (253 ft.). The three upper stages are richly&nbsp;decorated, and the whole is surmounted by a colossal statue&nbsp;of the Virgin. In the cathedral are a fine rood-loft, some good&nbsp;wood-carving and the tombs of several bishops. Other interesting buildings are the episcopal palace (r7th and Iqthcenturies),&nbsp;flanked by a massive tower, relic of an older palace; the church&nbsp;of St Amans, of Romanesque architecture, restored in the 18th&nbsp;century; and, among other old houses, the hôtel d’Armagnac&nbsp;built in the Renaissance period on the site of the old palace of&nbsp;the counts. The ruins of a Roman amphitheatre still exist&nbsp;in Rodez, which is supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct.&nbsp;About 6 m. to the north of Rodez is the chasm of Tindoul de la&nbsp;Vayssière, leading to a subterranean river issuing in the springs&nbsp;of the picturesque village of SalIes-Ia-Source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The town is the seat of a bishop, a prefect and a court of assizes, and has tribunals of first instance and commerce, a&nbsp;chamber of commerce, a branch of the Bank of France, a lycée&nbsp;training college for both sexes and an ecclesiastical seminary.&nbsp;The industries include wool-spinning and the weaving of woollen&nbsp;goods.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
