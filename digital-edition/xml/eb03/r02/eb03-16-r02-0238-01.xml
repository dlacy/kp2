                    reſults from their being both improvements, and both deſtined to pleaſure, a
                    cloſer relation ariſes from the property of a riding, <hi rend="italic">to
                        extend the idea of a ſeat</hi> and appropriate a whole country to the
                    manſion ; for which purpoſe it muſt be diſtinguiſhed from common roads, and the
                    marks of diſtinction muſt be borrowed from a garden. Thoſe which a farm or a
                    park can ſupply are faint and few ; but whenever circumſtances belonging to a
                    garden occur, they are immediately received as evidence of the domain. The
                    ſpecies of the trees will often be deci-ſive : plantations of firs, whether
                    placed on the ſides of the way, or in clumps or woods in the view, denote the
                    neighbourhood of a ſeat : even limes and horſe-cheſ-nuts are not indifferent ;
                    for they have always been frequent in improvements, and rare in the ordinary
                    ſcenes of cultivated nature. If the riding be carried through a wood, the
                    ſhrubs, which for their beauty or their fragrance have been tranſplanted from
                    the country into gardens, ſuch as the ſweet-briar, .the viburnum, the euonymus,
                    and the wood-bine, ſhould be encouraged in the underwood ; and to theſe may be
                    added ſeveral which are ſtill peculiar to ihrubberies, but which might eaſily be
                    transferred to the wildeſt coverts, and would</p>
                <p>require no further care.</p>
                <p>Where the ſpecies are not, the diſpoſition may be particular, and any appearance
                    of deſign is a mark of improvement. A few trees ſtanding out from a hedgerow,
                    raiſe it to an elegance above common ruſticity : and ſtill more may be done by
                    clumps in a field ; they give it the air of a park. A cloſe lane may be
                    decorated with plantations in all the little vacant ſpaces : and even the groups
                    originally on the ſpot (whether it be a wood, a field, or a lane), if properly
                    ſelected, and thoſe only left which are elegant, will have an effect : though
                    every beauty of this kind may be found in nature, yet many of them are ſeldom
                    ſeen together, and never unmixed. The number and the choice are ſymptoms of
                    deſign.</p>
                <p>Another ſymptom is variety. If the appendages of the riding be different in
                    different fields, if in a lane, or a wood, ſome diſtinguiſhing circumſtance be
                    provided for every bend ; or when, carried ever an open expo-ſure, it winds to
                    ſeveral points of view ; if this be the conduct throughout, the intention is
                    evident, to amuſe the length of the way : variety of ground is alio a
                    eharacteriſtic of a riding, when it ſeems to have proceeded from choice ; and
                    pleaſure being the pursuit, the changes of the ſcene both compenſate and account
                    for the circuity.</p>
                <p>But apart undiſtinguiſhed from a common road, ſuc-ceeding to others more
                    adorned, will by the contraſt alone be ſometimes agreeable ; and there are
                    beauties frequent in the high-way, and almoſt peculiar to it,</p>
                <p>which may be very acceptable in a riding : a green lane is always delightful; a
                    paſſage winding between thickets of brambles and briars, ſometimes with
                    ſometimes without a little ſpring-wood riſing amongſt them, or a cut in a
                    continued ſweep through the furze of a down or the fern of a heath, is generally
                    pleaſant. Nor will the character be abſolutely loſt in the interruption, it will
                    ſoon be reſumed, and never forgotten ; when it has been once ſtrongly impreſſed,
                    very flight means will preſerve the idea.</p>
                <p>Simplicity may prevail the whole length of the way when the way is all naturally
                    pleaſant, but eſpecially if it be a communication between ſeveral ſpots, which
                    in character are railed above the reſt of the country : A fine open grove is
                    unuſual, except in a park or a garden ; it has an elegance in the diſpoſition
                    which cannot be attributed to accident, and it ſeems to require a degree of
                    preſervation beyond the care of mere huſhandry. A neat railing on the edge of a
                    ſteep which commands a proſpect, alone diſtinguiſhes that from other points of
                    view. A building is ſtill more ſtrongly characteriſtic : it may be only
                    ornamental, or it may be accommodated to the reception of company ; for though a
                    place to alight at interrupts the range of a riding, yet, as the object of an
                    airing, it may often be acceptable. A ſmall ſpot which may be kept by the labour
                    of one man, incloſed from the fields, and converted into a ſhrubbery or any
                    other ſcene of a garden, will ſometimes be a pleaſing end to a ſhort excur-ſion
                    from home : nothing ſo effectually extends the idea of a ſeat to a diſtance ;
                    and not being conſtantly viſited, it will always retain the charms of novelty
                    and variety.</p>
                <p>When a riding is carried along a high road, a kind of property may in appearance
                    be claimed even there, by planting on both ſidcs trees equidiſtant from each
                    other, to give it the air of an approach : regularity intimates the
                    neighbourhood of a manſion. A village therefore ſeems to be within the domain,
                    if any of the inlets to it are avenues : other formal plantations about it, and
                    ſtill more trivial circumſtances, when they are evidently ornamental, ſometimes
                    produce and always corroborate ſuch an effect ; but even without railing this
                    idea, if the village be remarkable for its beauty, or only for its Angularity, a
                    paſſage through it may be an agreeable incident in a riding.</p>
                <p>The ſame ground which in the fields is no more than rough, often ſeems to be
                    romantic when it is the ſite of a village ; the buildings and other
                    circumſtances mark and aggravate the irregularity. To ſtrengthen this
                    appearance, one cottage may be placed on the edge of a ſteep, and ſome winding
                    ſteps of unhewn ſtonelead up to the door ; another in a hollow, with all its
                    little appurtenances hanging above it. The poſition of a few trees will
                    ſometimes anſwer the ſame purpoſe ; a footbridge here and there for a
                    communication between the ſides of a narrow dip, will add to the character ; and
                    if there be any rills, they may be conducted ſo as greatly to improve it.</p>
                <p>A village which has not theſe advantages of ground, may, however, be beautiful ;
                    it is diſtinguiſhed by its elegance, when the larger intervals between the
                    houſes are filled with open groves, and little clumps are introduced upon other
                    occaſions. The church often is, it generally may be, made a pictureſque object.
                    Even the cottages may be neat and ſometimes grouped</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0240" facs="gri_33125011196389_0246.tif"/>
                <p>with thickets. If the place be watered by a ſtream, the croſſings may be in a
                    variety of pleaſing deſigns; and if a ſpring riſe, or only a well for common uſe
                    be ſunk by the ſide of the way, a little covering over it maybe contrived which
                    ſhall at the ſame time be ſimple and pretty.</p>
                <p>There are few villages which may not eaſily be rendered agreeable. A ſmall
                    alteration in a houſe will ſometimes occaſion a great difference in the
                    appearance. By the help of a few trifling plantations, the objects which have a
                    good effect may be ſhown to advantage, thoſe which have not may be concealed,
                    and ſuch as are ſimilar be diſguiſed. And any form which offends the eye,
                    whether of ground, of trees, or of buildings, may ſometimes be broken by the
                    ſlighteſt circumſtances, by an advanced paling, or only by a bench. Variety and
                    beauty, in ſuch a ſubject, are rather the effects of attention than expence.</p>
                <p>But if the paſſage through the village cannot be pleaſant; if the buildings are
                    all alike, or ſtand in unmeaning rows and ſimilar ſituations; if the place
                    fur-niſhes no opportunities to contrail the forms of dwellings with thoſe of
                    out-houſes; to introduce trees and thickets; to interpoſe fields and meadows; to
                    mix farms with cottages; and to place the ſeveral objects in different
                    poſitions: yet on the outſide even of ſuch a village there certainly is room for
                    wood; and by that alone the whole may be grouped into a maſs, which ſhall be
                    agreeable when ſkirted by a riding; and ſtill more ſo when ſeen from a diſtance.
                    The ſeparate farms in the fields, alſo, by planting ſome trees about them, or
                    perhaps only by managing thoſe already on the ſpot, may be made very intereſting
                    objects; or if a new one is to be built, beauty may be conſulted in the form of
                    the houſe, and the diſpoſition of its appurtenances. Sometimes a character not
                    their own, as the ſemblance of a caſtle or an abbey, may be given to them; they
                    will thereby acquire a degree of conſideration, which they cannot otherwiſe be
                    entitled to: and objects to improve the views are ſo important to a riding, that
                    buildings muſt ſometimes be erected for that purpoſe only: but they ſhould be
                    ſuch as by an actual effect adorn or dignify the ſcene; not thoſe little ſlight
                    deceptions which are too well known to ſucceed, and have no merit if they fail:
                    for though a fallacy ſometimes contributes to ſupport a character, or ſuggeſts
                    ideas to the imagination, yet in itſelf it may be no improvement of a ſcene; and
                    a bit of turret, the tip of a ſpire, and the other ordinary ſubjects of theſe
                    frivolous attempts, are ſo inſignificant as objects, that whether they are real
                    or fictitious is almoſt a matter of indifference.</p>
                <p>The ſame means by which the proſpects from a riding are improved, may be applied
                    to thoſe from a garden; though they are not eſſential to its character, they are
                    important to its beauty; and wherever they abound, the extent only of the range
                    which commands them, determines whether they ſhall be ſeen from a riding or a
                    garden. If they belong to the latter, that aſſumes in ſome degree the
                    predominant properties of the former, and the two characters approach</p>
                <p>very near to each other: but ſtill each has its peculiarities. Progreſs is a
                    prevailing idea in a riding; and the pleaſantneſs of the way is, therefore, a
                    principal conſideration: but particular ſpots are more attended to in a garden;
                    and to them the communications ought to be ſubordinate; their direction muſt be
                    generally accommodated, their beauties ſometimes ſacri-ficed to the ſituation
                    and the character of the ſcenes they lead to; an advantageous approach to theſe
                    muſt be preferred to an agreeable line for the walk; and the circumſtances which
                    might otherwiſe become it are misplaced, if they anticipate the openings: it
                    ſhould ſometimes be contraſted to them; be retired and dark if they are ſplendid
                    or gay, and ſimple if they are richly adorned. At other times it may burſt
                    unexpectedly out upon them; not on account of the ſurpriſe, which Can have its
                    effect only once; but the impreſſions art ſtronger by being ſudden; and the
                    contrail is enforced by the quickneſs of the tranſition.</p>
                <p>In a riding, the ſcenes are only the amuſements of the way, through which it
                    proceeds without ſtopping: in a garden they are principal; and the
                    ſubordinatiori of the walk raiſes their importance. Every art, therefore, ſhould
                    be exerted to make them ſeem parts of the place. Diſtant proſpects cannot be ſo;
                    and the alienation does not offend us; we are familiarized to it; the extent
                    forbids every thought of a cloſer connection; and if a continuation be preſerved
                    between them and the points which command them, we are ſatisfied. But <hi
                        rend="italic"> home-views</hi> ſuggeſt other ideas; they appear to be
                    within our reach: they are not only beautiful in proſpect, and we can perceive
                    that the ſpots are delightful; but we wiſh to examine, to inhabit, and to enjoy
                    them. Every apparent impediment to that gratification is a diſappointment; and
                    when the ſcenes begin beyond the opening, the conſequence of the place 13
                    lowered; nothing within it engages our notice: it is an exhibition only of
                    beauties, the property of which does not belong to it; and that idea, though
                    indifferent in a riding which is but a paſſage, is very diſadvantageous to ſuch
                    a reſidence as a garden. To obviate ſuch an idea, the points of view ſhould be
                    made important; the objects within be appendages to thoſe without; the
                    ſeparations be removed or concealed; and large portions of the garden be annexed
                    to the ſpots which are contiguous to it. The ideal boundary of the place is then
                    carried beyond the ſcenes which are thus appropriated to it; and the wide
                    circuit in which they lie, and the different poſitions in which they may be
                    ſhown, afford a greater variety than can generally be found is any garden, the
                    ſcenery of which is confined to the in-cloſure.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">The ſeat of Mr Morris, near Chepſtowe, in
                            Monmouthſhire.</hi> </note>is not a large place; the park contains about 300 acres; and the
                    houſe ſtands in the midſt of it. On the ſide of the approach, the inequalities
                    of the ground are gentle, and the plantations pretty; but nothing there is
                    great. On the other ſide, a beautiful lawn falls precipitately every way into a
                    deep vale which ſhelves down the middle; the declivities are diverſified with
                    clumps and with groves; and a number of large trees ſtraggle along the bottom.

                <p>paſſed with wood; and through the wood are walks, which open beyond it upon
                    thoſe romantic ſcenes which ſurround the park, and which are the glory of
                    Pers-ſield. The Wye runs immediately below the wood: the river is of a dirty
                    colour; but the ſhape of its courſe is very various, winding firſt in the form
                    of a horſe-ſhoe, then proceeding in a large ſweep to the town of Chepſtowe, and
                    afterwards to the Severn. The banks are high hills; in different places ſteep,
                    bulging out, or hollow on the ſides; rounded, flattened, or irregular at top;
                    and covered with wood, or broken by rocks. They are ſometimes ſeen in front;
                    ſome-times in perſpective; falling back for the paſſage, or cloſing behind the
                    bend of the river; appearing to meet, riſing above, or ſhooting out beyond one
                    another. The wood which incloſes the lawn crowns an extenſive range of theſe
                    hills, which overlook all thoſe on the oppoſite ſhore, with the country which
                    appears above or between them; and winding themſelves as the river winds, their
                    ſides, all rich and beautiful, are alternately exhibited; and the point of view
                    in one ſpot becomes an object to the next.</p>
                <p>In many places the principal feature is a continued rock, in length a quarter of
                    a mile, perpendicular, high, and placed upon a height. To reſemble mins is
                    common to rocks : but no ruin of any lingle ſtructilre was ever equal to this
                    enormous pile ; it ſeems to be the remains of a city ; and other ſmaller heaps
                    ſcattered about it appear to be fainter traces of the former extent, and
                    ſtrengthen the ſimilitude. It ſtretches along the brow which terminates the
                    foreſt of Dean ; the face of it is compoſed of immenſe blocks of ſtone, but not
                    rugged; the top is bare and uneven, but not craggy; and from the foot of it, a
                    declivity, covered with thicket, ſlopes gently towards the Wye, but in one part
                    is abruptly broken off by a ledge of rocks, of a different hue, and in a
                    different direction. From the grotto it ſeems to riſe immediately over a thick
                    wood, which extends down a hill below the point of view, acroſs the valley
                    through which the Wye flows, and up the oppoſite banks, hides the river, and
                    continues without interruption to the bottom of the rock-: from another ſeat it
                    is ſeen by itſelf without even its baſe ; it faces another, with all its
                    appendages about it ; and ſometimes the fight of it is partially intercepted by
                    trees, beyond which, at a diſtance, its long line continues on through all the
                    openings between them.</p>
                <p>Another capital object is the caſtle of Chepſtowe, a noble ruin of great extent;
                    advanced to the very edge of a perpendicular rock, and ſo immediately rivetted
                    into it, that from the top of the battlements down to the river ſeems but one
                    precipice : the fame ivy which overſpreads the face of the one, twines and
                    cluſters amongſthe fragments of the other ; many towers, much of the walls, and
                    large remains of the chapel, are (landing. Cloſe to it is a moſt romantic wooden
                    bridge, very 7ιncient, very groteſque, at an extraordinary height above the
                    river, and ſeeming to abut againſt the ruins at one end, and ſome rocky hills at
                    the other. The caſtle is ſo near to the alcove at Persfield, that little
                    circumſtances in it may be diſcerned ; from other ſpots more diſtant, even from
                    the lawn, and from a ſhrubbery on the ſide of the lawn, it is diſtinctly
                    viſible,'and always beautiful, whether it is ſeen alone, or with the bridge,
                    with the town, with more or with leſs of</p>
                <p>the rich meadows which lie along the banks of the Wye, to its junction three
                    miles off with the Severn. A long ſweep of that river alſo, its red cliffs, and
                    the fine riſing country in the counties of Somerſet and Glou∙ ceſter, generally
                    terminate the proſpect.</p>
                <p>Moſt of the hills about Persfield are full of rocks ; ſome are intermixed with
                    hanging woods, aηd either advance a little before them, or retire· within them,
                    and are backed, or overhung, or ſeparated by trees. In the walk to the cave, a
                    long ſucceſſion of them is frequently ſeen in perſpective, all of a dark colour,
                    and with wood in the intervals between them. In other parts the rocks are more
                    wild and uncouth ; and ſometimes they Hand on the tops of the higheſt hills ; at
                    other times down as low as the river ; they are home-objects in one ſpot, and
                    appear only in the back-ground of another. »</p>
                <p>The woods concur with the rocks to render the ſcenes of Persfield romantic : the
                    place everywhere abounds with them ; they covey the tops of the hills $ they
                    hang on the ſteeps ; or they fill the depths of the valleys. In one place they
                    front, in another they riſe above, in another they fink below the point of view∣
                    they are ſeen ſometimes retiring beyond each other, and darkening as they recede
                    ; and ſometimes an opening between two is cloſed by a third at a diſtance beyond
                    them. A point, called the <hi rend="italic">Lover's Leap,</hi> commands a
                    continued ſurface of the thickeſt foliage, which overſpreads a vaſt hollow
                    immediately underneath. Below the Chineſe ſeat the courſe of the Wye is in the
                    ſhape of a horfe-ſhoe : it is on one ſide incloſed by a ſemicircular hanging
                    wood ; the direct ſteeps of a table-hill ſhut it in on the other ; and the great
                    rock fills the interval between them : in the midſt of this rude ſcene lies the
                    pe-ninſula formed by the river, a mile at the leaſt in length, and in the
                    higheſt ſtate of cultivation : hear the iithmus the ground riſes conſiderably,
                    and thence deſcends in a broken ſurface, till it flattens to the water’s edge at
                    the other extremity. The whole is divided into cornfields and paſtures ; they
                    are ſeparated by hedge-rows, coppices, and thickets ; open clumps and ſingle
                    trees ſtand out in the meadows ; and houſes and other buildings, which belong to
                    the farms, are ſcattered amongſt them : nature ſo cultivated, ſurrounded by
                    nature ſo wild, compoſe a moſt lovely Iandſcape together.</p>
                <p>The communications between theſe ſeveral points are generally by cloſe walks ;
                    but the covert ends near the Chineſe ſeat ; and a path is afterwards conducted
                    through the upper park to a ruſtic temple, which overlooks on one ſide ſome of
                    the romantic views which have been deſcribed, and on the other the cultivated
                    hills and valleys of Monmouthihire. To the rude and magnificent ſcenes of nature
                    now ſucceeds a pleaſant, fertile, and beautiful country, divided into
                    incloſures, not covered with woods, nor broken by rocks and precipices, but only
                    varied by eaſy ſwells and gentle declivities. Yet the proſpect is not tame: the
                    hills in it are high ; and it is bounded by a vaſt ſweep of the Severn, which is
                    here viſible for many miles together, and receives in its courſe the Wye and the
                    Avon.</p>
                <p>From the temple a road leads to the Windcliff, an eminence much above the reſt,
                    and commanding the whole in one view. The Wye runs at the foot of the hill ; the
                    peninſula lies juſt below ; the deep boſom of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0242" facs="gri_33125011196389_0248.tif"/>
                <p>the ſemicircular hanging wood is full in fight ; over part of it the great rock
                    appears ; all its baſe, all its accompaniments, are ſeen ; the country
                    immediately beyond it is full of lovely hillocks ; and the higher grounds in the
                    counties of Somerſet and Glouccſter riſe in the horizon. The Severn ſeems to be,
                    as it really is, above Chepſtowe, three or ſour miles wide; below the town it
                    ſpreads almoſt to a ſea ; the county of Monmouth is there the hither ſhore, and
                    between its beautiful, hills appear at a great diſtance the mountains of
                    Brecknock and Glamorganſhire. In extent, in variety, and grandeur, few proſpects
                    are equal to this. It comprehends all the noble ſcenes of Persfield, encompaſſed
                    by ſome of the fineſt country in Britain. See Gardening.</p>
