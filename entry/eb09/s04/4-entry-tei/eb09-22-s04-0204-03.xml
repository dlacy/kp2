Bracton, Britton, and other old writers derived the word from the French <hi rend="italic">soc,</hi> “ a ploughshare.” Modern etymologists, however, prefer to derive it from the Old English <hi rend="italic">soc,</hi> “ a franchise ” or “ privilege,” or the land over which such franchise or privilege was exercised. Socage differs from knight service in being agricultural rather than military in its nature, and from frankalmoign in being based on temporal rather than spiritual services. It is either free or villein. Free socage <hi rend="italic">in capite</hi> was abolished by 12 Car. II. c. 24. That form of free socage called common socage is the ordinary modern freehold tenure. Varieties of it are burgage, gavelkind, and petit serjeanty. Scutage, while it existed, was another variety. The only representative of villein socage is the comparatively rare tenure of ancient demesne confined to manors, described in Domesday Book as <hi rend="italic">terræ regis.</hi> Socage tenure is said to have formerly existed in Scotland. The descent of socage lands in Scotland seems to have been to all the sons equally, as was originally the case in England.
