<p><span class="font1">It is important to note that in all the Bryophyta and in some of the Pteridophyta (most of the Filicinae, all existing&nbsp;Equisetinae, and the Lycopodiaceae and Psilotaceae) there is&nbsp;but one kind of sporangium and spore, the plants being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">homo-sporous</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">isosporous,</span><span class="font1"> whereas the rest of the Pteridophyta&nbsp;(Hydropterideae, SeIagineDaceae) and the Phanerogams are&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jieterosporbus,</span><span class="font1"> having sporangia of two kinds; some produce one&nbsp;or a few large spores </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(megaspores'),</span><span class="font1"> and are hence termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">megasporangia,</span><span class="font1"> while others give rise to a larger number of small&nbsp;spores </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(microspores)</span><span class="font1"> and are hence termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">microsporangia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In the Phanerogams the two kinds of sporangia have received&nbsp;special names: the megasporangium, which produces as a&nbsp;rule only one mature spore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(embryo-sac),</span><span class="font1"> is termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovule*,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the microsporangium, which produces a large number of microspores </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pollen-grains),</span><span class="font1"> is termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pollen-sac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The development of spores, except in the simpler Thallophyta, is more or less restricted to definite parts of the body. Thus&nbsp;in the Red Algae (Florideae) there are the organs known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stichidia, nemathecia.</span><span class="font1"> In the fungi the number and variety of&nbsp;such organs is very great; they may be described generally as&nbsp;simple and compound </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sporophores*.</span><span class="font1"> but for a description the&nbsp;article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fungi</span><span class="font1"> should be consulted. In the higher plants the&nbsp;organs are less various. In the Bryophyta the production of&nbsp;spores is restricted to the sporogonium. In the vascular plants&nbsp;(Pteridophyta, Phanerogams) the development of sporangia,&nbsp;speaking generally, is confined to the leaves. In most ferns the&nbsp;Sporangiferous leaves </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sporophylls)</span><span class="font1"> do not differ in appearance&nbsp;from the foliage leaves; but in other Pteridopbyta (Equisetaceae,&nbsp;Marsiliaceae, some species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lycopodium</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Selaginella)</span><span class="font1"> they&nbsp;present considerable adaptation, and notably in the Phanerogams. In the Phanerogams the specialization is so great that&nbsp;the sporophylls have received, special names; those which bear&nbsp;the microsporangia (pollen-sacs) are termed tbe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stamens,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;those which bear the megasporangia (ovules) are termed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carpels.</span><span class="font1"> The sporophylls are usually aggregated together on a&nbsp;short stem, forming a shoot that constitutes a flower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many terms are employed to indicate the nature of the various kinds of spores, especially among the fungi, but the endless&nbsp;varieties of asexual (and asexually produced) reproductive&nbsp;cells may be grouped under two heads—(i) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gonidia,</span><span class="font1"> (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spores&nbsp;proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The distinction between these two kinds of asexual reproductive cells is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gonidium</span><span class="font1"> is a reproductive cell that gives rise, on germination, to an organism resembling the parent. For instance, among the algae, the “ zoospore ” of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vaucheria</span><span class="font1"> develops into&nbsp;a Vaucheria-plant. There is thus a close connexion between&nbsp;vegetative multiplication and multiplication by means of&nbsp;gonida. The production of gonida is entirely limited to the&nbsp;Thallophyta, and is especially marked in the fungi, though the&nbsp;nature of all the many kinds of reproductive cells formed in&nbsp;this group has not yet been fully investigated. It is, however,&nbsp;wanting in certain algae (Conjugatae, Fucaceae, Characeae) and&nbsp;fungi (some Peronosporeae and Ascomycetes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spore proper</span><span class="font1"> is a reproductive cell that as a rule gives rise, on germination, to an organism unlike that which produced it.&nbsp;For instance, the spore of a fern when it germinates gives rise,&nbsp;not to a fern-plant, but to a prothallium. The apparent&nbsp;exceptions'to this rule occur only among the Thallophyta, and&nbsp;are explained below in the section on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life-Mslory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The true spore is developed, usually in a sporangium, after a process of division which presents certain features that call for&nbsp;special notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Observation of the process of division of the nucleus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(karyo-kinesis)</span><span class="font1"> in plants generally has shown (for details see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cytology) </span><span class="font1">that the linin-reticulum of the resting nucleus breaks up into a&nbsp;definite number of segments, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chromosomes,</span><span class="font1"> each of which&nbsp;bears a series of minute bodies, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chromatin-disks</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chromo-meres,</span><span class="font1"> consisting largely of a substance termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chromatin.</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;the ordinary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">homotype</span><span class="font1"> divisions of the nuclei the characteristic&nbsp;number of chromosomes is always observable: but when the&nbsp;spore-mother-cells arc being formed the number of chromosomes&nbsp;is reduced to one-half. This, if the number of chromosomes of&nbsp;the parent plant be expressed as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2x</span><span class="font1"> the number in tbe spore&nbsp;will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x.</span><span class="font1"> To take a concrete case: it has been observed by&nbsp;Guignard and others that in the early divisions taking place in&nbsp;the developing anther and ovule of the lily the number of&nbsp;chromosomes is 24; whereas in the later divisions which give&nbsp;rise to the pollen-mother-cells in the one case and to the mother-cell of the embryo-sac in the other, the number of chromosomes&nbsp;is only 12. Thus the development of a spore (as distinguished&nbsp;from a gonidium) is always preceded by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reducing-</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heterotype-division,</span><span class="font1"> a process now more generally termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">meiosis</span><span class="font1"> (Farmer).&nbsp;The reduced number of chromosomes in the nucleus of the&nbsp;spore-mother-cell persists in the spore, and in all the cells of the&nbsp;organism to which the spore may give rise. (Meiosis is discussed&nbsp;below in the section on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Reproduction.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It should be explained that cells, to which the name “ spore ” has also been applied, are formed as the result of a sexual act:&nbsp;such are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zygospores, oospores,</span><span class="font1"> and some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carpospores.</span><span class="font1"> But these&nbsp;cells differ from spores proper not only in their mode of origin&nbsp;but also in that their nuclei contain the full double number </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(2x)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of chromosomes; hence they may be distinguished as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">diplospores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Reproduction.—</span><span class="font1">Sexual reproduction involves the development of sexual organs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gametangia)</span><span class="font1"> and sexual cells.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gametes).</span><span class="font1"> When the organism is unicellular, as in the lower&nbsp;Green Algae </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Protococcaceae, Conjugatae), the cell becomes&nbsp;a sexual organ and its whole protoplasm gives rise to one or more&nbsp;sexual cells: in the higher forms certain parts of the body are&nbsp;specialized as sexual organs. In many of the lower plants the&nbsp;organs present no external distinction of sex </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> lower Green&nbsp;Algae: the Chytridiaceae, Mucorinae, and some Ascomycetes&nbsp;among the fungi): it is impossible to distinguish between tbe&nbsp;male and feïhale organs, although it cannot be doubted that&nbsp;the essential physiological difference exists; consequently the&nbsp;organs are merely described as gametangia. The gap between&nbsp;these plants and those with differentiated sexual organs is,&nbsp;however, bridged over by intermediate forms, as explained in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Algae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the sexual organs are more or less obviously differentiated into male and female, they present considerable variety of form in different groups of plants, and accordingly bear&nbsp;different names. Thus the male organ is a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pollinodium</span><span class="font1"> in most&nbsp;of the fungi, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spermogonium</span><span class="font1"> in others (certain Ascomycetes,&nbsp;Uredineae); in all other plants it is an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">antheridium.</span><span class="font1"> Similarly&nbsp;the female organ is an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oogonium</span><span class="font1"> in various Thallophyta (Green&nbsp;and Brown Algae: Oomycetous Fungi); a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">procarp</span><span class="font1"> in the Red&nbsp;Algae; an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">archicarp</span><span class="font1"> in certain Ascomycetous Fungi and in the&nbsp;Uredineae; an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">archegonium</span><span class="font1"> in all the higher plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is generally the case that the protoplasm of the sexual organ is differentiated into one or more sexual cells. Thus the game-tangium usually gives rise to cells which, as they are externally&nbsp;similar, are termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">isogametes</span><span class="font1"> or simply </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gametes.</span><span class="font1"> Certain forms&nbsp;of the male organ, the Spermogonium and the antheridium, give&nbsp;rise to male cells which are termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spermatia</span><span class="font1"> when they are non-ciliate, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spermatozoids</span><span class="font1"> when they are ciliated and free-swimming.&nbsp;Again, the female organs termed oogonia and archegonia produce&nbsp;one or more female cells called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oospheres.</span><span class="font1"> But there are important exceptions to this rule. Thus the protoplasm is not&nbsp;differentiated into cells in the gametangium of the Mucorinae;&nbsp;in the male organ (pollinodium), of fungi generally; and in the&nbsp;female organ (procarp) of the Red Algae and (archicarp) of the&nbsp;Ascomycetes and Uredineae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The immediate product of the fusion of cells, or of undifferentiated protoplasm, derived from sexual organs of opposite sex may be generally termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zygote*,</span><span class="font1"> but it is not always of the&nbsp;same kind. Thus when two isogametes, or the undifferentiated&nbsp;contents of two gametangia, fuse together, the process is designated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conjugation,</span><span class="font1"> and the product is usually a single cell&nbsp;termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zygospore.</span><span class="font1"> When an oosphere fuses with a male cell,&nbsp;or with the undifferentiated contents of a male organ, the process&nbsp;is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fertilization,</span><span class="font1"> and the product is a single cell termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oospore.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">When, finally, a female organ with undifferentiated contents&nbsp;receives a male cell, the process again is fertilization; here the.</span></p>
