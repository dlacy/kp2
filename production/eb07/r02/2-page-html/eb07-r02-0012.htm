<p><span class="font0">If the water met with no resistance from the bed in which it runs, if it had no adhesion to its sides and bottom,&nbsp;and if its fluidity were perfect, its gravity would accelerate&nbsp;its course continually, and the earth and its inhabitants&nbsp;would be deprived of all the advantages which they derive&nbsp;from its numberless streams. They would run off so quickly, that our fields, dried up as soon as watered, would be&nbsp;barren and useless. No soil could resist the impetuosity&nbsp;of the torrents ; and their accelerating force would render&nbsp;them a destroying scourge, were it not that, by kind Providence, the resistance of the bed, and the viscidity of the&nbsp;fluid, become a check which reins them in and sets bounds&nbsp;to their rapidity. In this manner the friction on the sides,&nbsp;which, by the viscidity of the water, is communicated to&nbsp;the whole mass, and the very adhesion of the particles to&nbsp;each other, and to the sides of the channel, are the causes&nbsp;which make the resistances bear a relation to the velocity ;&nbsp;so that the resistances, augmenting with the velocities, come&nbsp;at last to balance the accelerating force. Then the velocity now acquired is preserved, and the motion becomes&nbsp;uniform, without being able to acquire new increase, unless&nbsp;some change succeeds either in the slope or in the capacity&nbsp;of the channel. Hence arises the second maxim in the&nbsp;motion of rivers, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">when a stream moves uniformly, the&nbsp;resistance is equal to the accelerating force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As in the efflux of water through orifices, we pass over the very beginnings of the accelerated motion, which is a&nbsp;matter of speculative curiosity, and consider the motion in&nbsp;a state of permanency, depending on the head of water, the&nbsp;area of the orifice, the velocity, and the expense ; so in the&nbsp;theory of the uniform motion of rivers, we consider the&nbsp;slope, the transverse section or area of the stream, the uniform velocity, and the expense. It will be convenient to&nbsp;affix precise meanings to the terms which we shall employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The section of a stream is the area of a plane perpendicular to the direction of the general motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The resistances arise ultimately from the action of the water on the internal surface of the channel, and must be&nbsp;proportional </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(cœteris paribus)</span><span class="font0"> to the extent of the action.&nbsp;Therefore, if we unfold the whole edge of this section, which&nbsp;is rubbed as it were by the passing water, we shall have a&nbsp;measure of the extent of this action. In a pipe, circular or&nbsp;prismatical, the whole circumference is acted on ; but in a&nbsp;river or canal ACDR (fig. 6) the horizontal line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font0">O</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;makes the upper boundary of the section </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">CD</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> is free from&nbsp;all action. The action is confined to the three lines </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">αC,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">CD, De. We shall call this line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">CDe the border of the&nbsp;section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mean velocity is that with which the whole section, moving equally, would generate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> solid equal to the expense of the stream. This velocity is to be found perhaps but in one filament of the stream, and we do not know&nbsp;in which filament it is to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since we are attempting to establish an empirical theory of the motion of rivers, founded entirely on experiments, and&nbsp;palpable deductions from them, and since it is extremely&nbsp;difficult to make experiments on open streams which shall&nbsp;have a precision sufficient for such an important purpose,&nbsp;it would be a most desirable thing to demonstrate an exact&nbsp;analogy between the mutual balancing of the acceleration&nbsp;and resistance in pipes and in rivers ; for in those we can&nbsp;not only make experiments with all the desired accuracy,&nbsp;and admitting precise measures, but we can make them in&nbsp;a number of cases that are almost impracticable in rivers.&nbsp;We can increase the slope of a pipe from nothing to the&nbsp;vertical position, and we can employ every desired degree&nbsp;of pressure, so as to ascertain its effect on the velocity in de</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">grees which open streams will not admit of. The Chevalier du Buat has most happily succeeded in this demonstration ;&nbsp;and it is here that his good fortune and his penetration have&nbsp;done so much service to practical science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let AB (fig. 7) be a horizontal tube, through which the water is impelled by the pressure or head DA. This head&nbsp;is the moving power ; and it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">may be conceived as consisting</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of two parts, performing two</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">distinct offices. One of them</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is employed in impressing on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the water that velocity with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actually moves</span><span class="font0"> in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tube. Were there no obstruc</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tions to this motion, no greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">head would be wanted ; but</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">there are obstructions, arising from friction, adhesion, and viscidity. This requires force. Let this be the office of&nbsp;the rest of the head of water in the reservoir. There is&nbsp;but one allotment, appropriation, or repartition of the whole&nbsp;head which will answer. Suppose E to be the point of&nbsp;partition, so that DE is the head necessary for impressing&nbsp;the actual velocity on the water (a head or pressure which&nbsp;has a relation to the form or circumstance of the entry, and&nbsp;the contraction which takes place there). The rest EA is&nbsp;wholly employed in overcoming the simultaneous resistances&nbsp;which take place along the whole tube AB, and is in equi-librio with this resistance. Therefore, if we apply at E a&nbsp;tube EC, of the same length and diameter with AB, and&nbsp;having the same degree of polish or roughness ; and if this&nbsp;tube be inclined in such a manner that the axis of its extremity may coincide with the axis of AB in the point C ;&nbsp;we affirm that the velocity will be the same in both pipes,&nbsp;and that they will have the same expense ; for the moving&nbsp;force in the sloping pipe EC is composed of the whole&nbsp;weight of the column DE and the relative weight of the&nbsp;column EC ; but this relative weight, by which alone it&nbsp;descends along the inclined pipe EC, is precisely equal to&nbsp;the weight of a vertical column EA of the same diameter.&nbsp;Everything therefore is equal in the two pipes, viz. the&nbsp;lengths, the diameters, the moving forces, and the resistances ; therefore the velocities and discharges will also be&nbsp;equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is not only the case on the whole, but also in every part of it. The relative weight of any part of it EK is precisely in equilibrio with the resistances along that part of&nbsp;the pipe ; for it has the same proportion to the whole relative weight that the resistance has to the whole resistance.&nbsp;Therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(and this is the most important circumstance, and&nbsp;the basis of the whole theory)</span><span class="font0"> the pipe EC may be cut shorter,&nbsp;or may be lengthened to infinity, without making any change&nbsp;in the velocity or expense, so long as the propelling head&nbsp;DE remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Leaving the whole head DA as it is, if we lengthen the horizontal pipe AB to G, it is evident that we increase the&nbsp;resistance without any addition of force to overcome it.&nbsp;The velocity must therefore be diminished ; and it will now&nbsp;be a velocity which is produced by a smaller head than DE ;&nbsp;therefore, if we were to put in a pipe of equal length at E,&nbsp;terminating in the horizontal line AG, the water will not&nbsp;run equally in both pipes. In order that it may, we must&nbsp;discover the diminished velocity with which the water now&nbsp;actually runs along AG, and we must make a head DI capable of impressing this velocity at the entry of the pipe,&nbsp;and then insert at I a pipe IH of the same length with AG.&nbsp;The expense and velocity of both pipes will now be the&nbsp;same.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> We recommend it to the reader to make this distribution or allotment of the different portions of the pressure very familiar to his mind. It is of the most extensive influence in every question of hydraulics, and will on every occasion give him distinct conceptions of the internal procedure. Obvious as the thought seems to be, it has escaped the attention of all the writers on the subject.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
