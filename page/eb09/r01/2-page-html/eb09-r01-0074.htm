<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">which would strike the balance in its favour in the struggle with Spain, exercised a strong fascination over the imaginative character of Raleigh. In the next year, 1596, however, he was wanted nearer home, and was compelled to&nbsp;content himself with sending one of his followers, Captain&nbsp;Keymis, to extend his knowledge of Guiana. He was&nbsp;himself called on to take the command of a squadron in&nbsp;the expedition sent against Spain under Lord Howard of&nbsp;Effingham and the earl of Essex. It was Raleigh who,&nbsp;on the arrival of the fleet off Cadiz, persuaded Howard&nbsp;and Essex to begin by an attack on the Spanish fleet, and&nbsp;who himself led the van in sailing into the harbour. Before&nbsp;long the Spanish fleet was thoroughly beaten, and all of&nbsp;it, except two vessels which were captured, was destroyed&nbsp;by the Spaniards themselves. Raleigh was wounded in&nbsp;the action, and the subsequent capture of Cadiz was carried&nbsp;out by others. In May 1597 Elizabeth, who was growing&nbsp;somewhat tired of the petulance of Essex, readmitted&nbsp;Raleigh to court. It was arranged that he should go as&nbsp;rear-admiral of a fleet, under the command of Essex,&nbsp;intended to cripple yet further the maritime power of&nbsp;Spain. The “ island voyage,” as it was called, was on the&nbsp;whole a failure, the only notable achievement being the&nbsp;capture of Fayal (Azores) by Raleigh in the absence of&nbsp;Essex. The generous nature of Essex was overmastered&nbsp;by vanity, and, falling under the sway of meaner men, he&nbsp;grew to regard Raleigh as a personal rival. He did not&nbsp;even mention the capture of Fayal in his official account&nbsp;of the voyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1598 Elizabeth, who was always ready to reward her courtiers at the expense of others, completed a bargain&nbsp;in Raleigh’s favour. In 1591 he had obtained, through&nbsp;the queen’s intervention, a lease for ninety-nine years of&nbsp;the manor of Sherborne from the bishop of Salisbury. In&nbsp;1598 the see was vacant. Aspirants to the mitre were&nbsp;informed that only by converting the lease into a perpetual&nbsp;estate in Raleigh’s favour could the object of their wishes&nbsp;be obtained. On these terms Dr Cotton became bishop&nbsp;of Salisbury and Raleigh possessor of Sherborne in full&nbsp;ownership. In 1600 Raleigh added to his other offices&nbsp;that of governor of Jersey. A temporary reconciliation&nbsp;between Raleigh and Essex was followed by a permanent&nbsp;estrangement when Essex was appointed to the government of Ireland, the personal feeling on both sides being&nbsp;probably strengthened by the divergence between their&nbsp;Irish policies,—Raleigh wishing to use force alone, whilst&nbsp;Essex wished to come to terms with Tyrone. When Essex&nbsp;rushed into his final act of rebellion he gave out as one of&nbsp;his reasons his fear of being murdered by Raleigh and&nbsp;Lord Cobham, who at this time were allied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">After the death of Essex the question of the succession assumed a pressing importance with the imminence of the&nbsp;close of Elizabeth’s reign. Cecil, allying himself with the&nbsp;intriguing Lord Henry Howard, assured himself of James’s&nbsp;favour, and poisoned his ear against Raleigh and Cobham.&nbsp;Into Raleigh’s feelings at this time it is impossible to&nbsp;penetrate with certainty, but it can hardly be doubted&nbsp;that, though he professed himself ready to support James’s&nbsp;claim, he did not throw his whole heart into the cause of&nbsp;the Scottish king. Raleigh was the man of the struggle&nbsp;against Spain, self-reliant and unrelenting, eager to push on&nbsp;the reprisals on Spain till the Spanish monarchy was utterly&nbsp;beaten down. James was a lover of peace, anxious to live&nbsp;on good terms with all his neighbours, and under the belief&nbsp;that by fair dealing the Catholic powers and the pope&nbsp;himself might be brought to accept loyally the hand which&nbsp;he was ready to hold out. Raleigh, in short, wished to&nbsp;emphasize the differences which divided Christendom;&nbsp;James wished to treat them as hardly existing at all.&nbsp;When James came to the throne, therefore, he was certain</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to come into conflict with Raleigh, and not being able to see the advantage of keeping about him men of different&nbsp;tempers he dismissed him from the captaincy of the guard,&nbsp;compelled him to surrender the wardenship of the Stannaries, suspended his patent of wine licences as a monopoly,&nbsp;and took from him the governorship of Jersey, though for&nbsp;this he gave him a pension to compensate for his loss. That&nbsp;which followed it is impossible to fathom to the bottom.&nbsp;Raleigh must have been very angry, and it is quite possible&nbsp;that he may have used violent language and have even&nbsp;spoken of a Spanish invasion as preferable to the rule of&nbsp;James, or have declared his preference of the title of&nbsp;Arabella Stuart to that of the existing sovereign. The&nbsp;main witness against him was Cobham, and Cobham made&nbsp;and retracted his charges with such levity that it is impossible to trust to his evidence. Raleigh, however, was&nbsp;imprisoned, and, after attempting to commit suicide, was&nbsp;brought to trial at Winchester in November 1603, when he&nbsp;was condemned to death. The king, however, commuted&nbsp;his sentence upon the scaffold to one of imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">During his imprisonment in the Tower Raleigh devoted himself to chemical experiments and to literary work. It&nbsp;was here that he composed so much of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the&nbsp;World</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> as was ever finished, and that he also issued pamphlets on questions of passing politics. Here too he learned&nbsp;that misfortune continued to follow him, and that there&nbsp;was a flaw in the conveyance by which he had made over&nbsp;Sherborne to trustees to save it from the usual consequences&nbsp;of attainder, and that James had seized it for his favourite&nbsp;Carr, though he gave in compensation £8000 and a pension of £400 a year for the lives of Lady Raleigh and her&nbsp;eldest son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Raleigh’s thoughts had often turned to Guiana. An offer made by him in 1612 to send Keymis to the gold&nbsp;mine which he believed to exist near the Orinoco was&nbsp;rejected, but in 1616 he was himself released at the intercession of Yilliers, on the understanding that he was to go&nbsp;in person to Guiana, and was to visit the gold mine. As&nbsp;a security that he would not encroach upon the territory&nbsp;of Spain, he Avas to remain unpardoned, so that his life&nbsp;might be at the king’s mercy if he broke his promise. It&nbsp;is probably not doing injustice to Raleigh to suppose that&nbsp;he had no intention of keeping it if it proved inconvenient.&nbsp;As far as Avas then knoAvn, indeed, the spot Avhere the mine&nbsp;Avas supposed to be might be reached Avithout passing a&nbsp;Spanish settlement, though he Avas aAvare that the Spaniards&nbsp;claimed the Avhole country as their OAvn. To seize Spanish&nbsp;territory and to fight the Spaniards in every possible Avay&nbsp;was, lioAvever, regarded by him as altogether righteous as&nbsp;well as politic, and he had no respect for James’s scruples,&nbsp;which arose partly from Aveakness, but partly also from a&nbsp;respect for international obligations, Avhich in the case&nbsp;of Spain Avas foreign to Raleigh’s mind. Most likely&nbsp;Raleigh thought that all Avould be well if he brought home&nbsp;sufficient evidence that the mine Avas AA<sup>T</sup>orth possessing.&nbsp;Before he sailed he suggested to James that he should be&nbsp;alloAved to attack Genoa, a city in dependence on Spain,&nbsp;and AA’hen this plan was rejected he entered into communication with the French ambassador and sent to the&nbsp;admiral of France to ask permission to bring into a French&nbsp;harbour all that he might gain on his voyage. The expedition turned out badly. His sailors would not ascend&nbsp;the Orinoco unless he remained at the mouth to keep off&nbsp;the Spaniards. Those who ascended found a Spanish&nbsp;village in the Avay, and after a sharp fight drove the&nbsp;Spaniards out and burned the place. The mine, if it really&nbsp;existed, they never reached, and Raleigh had to return to&nbsp;England with failure on his head. He was soon arrested&nbsp;and lodged in the Tower.</span></p>
