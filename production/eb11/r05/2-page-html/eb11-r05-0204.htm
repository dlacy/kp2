<p><span class="font0">Rymer.” Some of hîs poetical pieces were also inserted in J. Nichols’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Select Collection</span><span class="font0"> (1780-86, 8 vols.), and two are&nbsp;reproduced in A. H. Bullen’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Musa Proterva</span><span class="font0"> (1895).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two more volumes of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera</span><span class="font0"> were issued by Sanderson in 1715 and 1717, and the last three volumes (xviii., xix. and xx.) by&nbsp;the same editor, but upon a slightly different plan, in 1726-35. The&nbsp;latter volumes were published by Tonson, all the former by Churchill.&nbsp;Under Rymer it was carried down to 1586, and continued by Sanderson to 1654. The rarity and importance of the work induced&nbsp;Tonson to obtain a licence for a second edition, and George Holmes,&nbsp;deputy keeper of the Tower records, was appointed editor. The&nbsp;new edition appeared. between 1727 and 1735. The last three&nbsp;volumes are the same in both issues. There are some corrections,&nbsp;enumerated in a volume, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Emendations in the New Edition oj Mr&nbsp;Rymer<sup>1</sup>s Foedera,</span><span class="font0"> printed by Tonson in 1730, and on the whole the&nbsp;second is an improvement upon the first edition. A third edition,&nbsp;embodying Holmes’s collation, was commenced at the Hague in 173.7&nbsp;and finished in 1745. It is in smaller type than the others, and is&nbsp;compressed within ten folio volumes.. The arrangement is rather&nbsp;more convenient; there is some additional matter; the index is&nbsp;better; the type is not so good, but it is to be preferred to either of the&nbsp;previous editions. When the volumes of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera</span><span class="font0"> first appeared&nbsp;they were analysed by Leclerc and Rapin in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque choisie&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne.</span><span class="font0"> Rapin's articles were collected together and appended, under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abregé historique&nbsp;des actes publiques de l<sup>1</sup> Angleterre,</span><span class="font0"> to the Hague edition. A translation, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acta Regia,</span><span class="font0"> was published by Stephen Whatley,&nbsp;(1726-27), 4 vols. 8vo, reprinted both in 8vo and folio, the latter&nbsp;edition containing an analysis of the cancelled sheets, relating to&nbsp;the journals of the first parliament of Charles I., of the 18th volume&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1810 the Record Commissioners authorized Dr Adam Clarke to prepare a new and improved edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font0"> Six parts, large&nbsp;folio, edited by Clarke, Caley and Holbrooke, were published between&nbsp;1816 and 1830. Considerable additions were made, but the editing&nbsp;was performed in so unsatisfactory a manner that the publication&nbsp;was suspended in the middle of printing a seventh part. The latter&nbsp;portion, bringing the work down to 1383, was ultimately issued in&nbsp;1869. A general introduction to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera</span><span class="font0"> was issued by the&nbsp;Record Commission in 1817, 4to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wide learning and untiring labours of Rymer have received the warmest praise from historians. His industry was praised by&nbsp;Hearne </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Collections,</span><span class="font0"> ii. 296). Sir T. D. Hardy styles the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera</span><span class="font0"> “ a&nbsp;work of which this nation has every reason to be proud, for with&nbsp;all its blemishes—and what work is faultless?—it has no rival in its&nbsp;class ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Syllabus,</span><span class="font0"> voi. ii. xxxvi.), and Mr J. B. Mullinger calls it “ a&nbsp;collection of the highest value and authority ” (Gardiner and&nbsp;Mullinger's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to English History,</span><span class="font0"> p. 224).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best account of Rymer is to be found in the prefaces to Sir T. D. Hardy’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syllabus</span><span class="font0"> (1869-85, 3 vols. 8vo). There is an unpublished&nbsp;life by Des Maizeaux (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. No. 4223), and a few&nbsp;memoranda in Bishop Rennet’s collections (Lansd. MS. No. 987).&nbsp;See also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diet, of Nat.

In Caulfield’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Portraits,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.&nbsp;(1819), i. 50, may be seen an engraving of Rymer, with a description&nbsp;of. a satirical print of him as “ a garreteer poet.” Rymer’s two&nbsp;critical works on the drama are discussed by Sir T. N. Talfourd in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Retrospective Review</span><span class="font0"> (1820), voi. i. pp. 1—15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir .T. D.

In the British Museum is preserved&nbsp;(Add. MS. 24699) a folio volume of reports and papers relating to&nbsp;the Record edition. Rymer left extensive materials for a new&nbsp;edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera,</span><span class="font0"> bound in 59 vols, folio, and embracing the&nbsp;period from 1115 to 1698. This was the collection offered to the earl&nbsp;of Oxford. It was purchased by the Treasury for £215 from a&nbsp;Mrs Anna Parnell, to whom Rymer left all his property, and is now&nbsp;in the British Museum (Add. MSS. Nos. 4573 to 4630, and 38911).&nbsp;A catalogue and index may be consulted in the 17th volume of&nbsp;Tonson’s edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font0"> The Public Record Office possesses&nbsp;a MS. volume, compiled by Robert Lemon about 1800, containing&nbsp;instruments in the Patent Rolls omitted by Rymer.

<p><span class="font0">RYOT, or Rayat (from the Arabic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rtPa,</span><span class="font0"> “ to pasture ”), properly a subject, then a tenant of the soil. The word is used&nbsp;throughout India for the general body of cultivators; but it&nbsp;has a special meaning in different provinces. The ryotwari&nbsp;tenure is one of the two main revenue systems in India. Where&nbsp;the land revenue is imposed on an individual or community&nbsp;owning an estate, and occupying a position analogous to that&nbsp;of a landlord, the assessment is known as zamindari; and&nbsp;where the land revenue is imposed on individuals who are the&nbsp;actual occupants, the assessment is known as ryotwari. Under&nbsp;zamindari tenure the land is held as independent property;&nbsp;while under ryotwari tenure it is held of the crown in a right of&nbsp;occupancy, which is under British rule both heritable and transferable. The former system prevails in northern and central&nbsp;India, and the latter in Bombay, Madras, Assam and Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYSWICK, TREATY OF, the peace which in 1697 ended the war between France on the one side and the Empire, England,&nbsp;Spain and Holland, on the other. Begun in 1689 under the&nbsp;leadership of the new king of England, William III., its object&nbsp;was to put a check on the ambitious designs of Louis XIV., and&nbsp;it raged in the Netherlands, the Rhineland, Italy, Ireland&nbsp;and Spain, in India and America and on the sea (see Grand&nbsp;Alliance, War of the). Negotiations for peace had begun in&nbsp;1696, but they were soon broken off, William III. and the&nbsp;English parliament at this time refusing to treat except “ with&nbsp;our swords in our hands.” But in May 1697 they were renewed&nbsp;under the mediation of the king of Sweden. The French representatives had their headquarters at the Hague and those&nbsp;of the allies at Delft, the conferences between them taking&nbsp;place at Ryswick. For the first few weeks no result was reached,&nbsp;and in June William III. and Louis XIV., the protagonists&nbsp;in the struggle, each appointed one representative to * meet&nbsp;together privately. The two chosen were William Bentinck,&nbsp;earl of Portland, and marshal Boufflers, and they soon drew up&nbsp;the terms of an agreement, to which, however, the emperor&nbsp;Leopold I. and the king of Spain would not assent. But in a&nbsp;short time Spain gave way, and on the 20th of September 1697&nbsp;a treaty of peace was signed between France and the three&nbsp;powers, England, Spain and Holland, the Empire still holding&nbsp;aloof. William then persuaded Leopold to make peace, and a&nbsp;treaty between France and the Empire was signed on the 30th&nbsp;of October following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The basis of the peace was that all towns and districts seized since the treaty of Nijmwegen in 1679 should be restored. Then&nbsp;France surrendered Freiburg, Breisach and Philippsburg to&nbsp;Germany, although she kept Strassburg. On the other hand,&nbsp;she regained Pondicherry and Nova Scotia, while Spain recovered&nbsp;Catalonia, and the barrier fortresses of Mons, Luxemburg and&nbsp;Courtrai. The duchy of Lorraine, which for many years had&nbsp;been in the possession of France, was restored to Leopold Joseph,&nbsp;a son of duke Charles V., and the Dutch were to be allowed to&nbsp;garrison some of the chief fortresses in the Netherlands, including&nbsp;Namur and Ypres. Louis undertook to recognize William as&nbsp;king of England, and promised to give no further assistance to&nbsp;James II.; he abandoned his interference in the electorate of&nbsp;Cologne and also the claim which he had put forward to some&nbsp;of the lands of the Rhenish Palatinate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RZHEV, or Rzhov, a town of Russia, in the government of Tver, 76 m. S.W. of the town of Tver, occupying the bluffs&nbsp;on both banks of the Volga (here 350 ft. wide) near the confluence of the Vazuza. Pop. (1900) 31,514. It is the terminus&nbsp;of a branch line (85 m.) from the St Petersburg &amp; Moscow&nbsp;railway, and is the centre of a large transit trade between&nbsp;Orel, Kaluga and Smolensk and the ports of St Petersburg and&nbsp;Riga. In the 12th century Rzhev belonged to the principality&nbsp;of Smolensk. Under the rulers of Novgorod it became from&nbsp;1225 a subordinate principality, and in the 15th century the&nbsp;two portions of the town were held by two independent princes.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
