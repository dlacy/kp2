She continued with him during his reign ; and he loved her ſo ridiculouſly, that he ſometimes ſhowed her to his ſoldiers dreſſed in armour, and ſometimes to his companions ſtark naked.</p><p>But of all his vices, his prodigality was the moſt remarkable, and that which in ſome meaſure gave riſe to the reſt. The luxuries of former emperors were ſimplicity itſelf, when compared to thoſe which he practiſed. He contrived new ways of bathing, where the richeſt oils and moſt precious perfumes were exhauſted with the utmoſt profuſion. He found out diſhes of immenſe value; and had even jewels, as we are told, diſſolved among his ſauces. He ſometimes had ſervices of pure gold preſented before his gueſts inſtead of meat ; obſerving, that a man ſhould be an ceconomiſt or an emperor.</p><p>For ſeveral days together he flung conſiderable ſums of money among the people. He ordered ſhips of a prodigious bulk to be built of cedar, the Items of ivory inlaid with gold and jewels, the fails and tackling of various ſilks, while the decks were planted with the choiceſt fruit tιees, under the ſhade of which he often dined. Here, attended by all the miniſters of his pleaſures, the moſt exquiſite fingers, and the moſt beautiful youths, he coaſted along the ſhore of Campania with great ſplendor. All his buildings ſeemed rather calculated to raiſe aſtoniſhment, than to anſwer the purpoſes of utility. But the moſt notorious inſtance of his fruitleſs profuſion was the vaſt bridge at Puteoli, which he undertook in the third year of his reigu. To ſatisfy his deſire of being maſter as well of the ocean as the land, he cauſed an infinite number of ſhips to be faſtened to each other, ſo as to make a floating bridge from Baiæ to Puteoli, acroſs an arm of the ſea three miles and an half broad. The ſhips being placed in two rows, in form of a creſeent, were ſecured to each other with anchors, chains, and cables. Over theſe were laid vaſt quantities of timber, and upon that earth, ſo as to make the whole reſemble one of the ſtreets of Rome. He next cauſed ſeveral houſes to be built upon his new bridge, for the reception of himſelf and his attendants, into which freſh water was conveyed by pipes from land. He then repaired thither with all his court, attended by prodigious throngs of people, who came from all parts to be ſpectators of ſuch an expenſive pageant. It was there that Caligula, adorned with all the magnificence of eaſtern royalty, ſitting on horſeback with a civic crown and Alexander’s breaſt-plate, attended by the great officers of the army, and all the nobility of Rome, entered at one end of the bridge, and with ridiculous importance rode to the other. At night, the number of torches and other illuminations with which this expenſive ſtructure was adorned, caſt ſuch a gleam as illuminated the whole bay, and all the neighbouring mountains. This - ſeemed to give the weak emperor new cauſe for exultation ; boaſting that he had turned night into day, as well as ſea into land.</p><p>The next morning he again rode over in a triumphant chariot, followed by a numerous train of charioteers, and all his ſoldiers in glittering armour. He then aſcended a roſtrum erected for the occaſion, where he made a ſolemn oration in praiſe of the greatneſs of his enterpriſe, and the aſſiduity of his w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>orkmen and his army. He then diſtributed rewards among his men, and a ſplendid feaſt ſucceeded. In the midſt of the entertainment many of his attendants were thrown into the ſea ; ſeveral ſhips filled with ſpectators were attacked and ſunk in an hoſtile manner ; and although the majority eſeaped through the calmneſs of the weather, yet many were drowned ; and ſome who endeavoured to ſave themſelves by climbing to the bridge, were ſtruck down again by the emperor’s command. The calmneſs of the ſea during this pageant, which continued ſor two days, furniſhed Caligula with freſh opportunities for boaſting ; being heard to ſay, “ that Neptune took care to keep the ſea ſmooth and ſerene, merely out of reverence to him.”</p><p>Expences like theſe, it may be naturally ſuppoſed, muſt have exhauſted the moſt unbounded wealth : in fact, after reigning about a year, Caligula found his revenues totally exhauſted ; and a fortune of about x 8,ooo,ooo of our money, which Tiberius had amaſſed together, entirely ſpent in extravagance and folly. Now, therefore, his prodigality put him upon new methods of ſupplying the exchequer ; and as before his profuſion, ſo now his rapacity became boundleſs. He put in practice all kinds of rapine and extortion ; while his principal ſtudy ſeemed to be the inventing new im-poſts and illicit confiſcations. Every thing was taxed, to the very wages of the meaneſt tradesman. He cauſed freemen to purchaſe their freedom a ſecond time ; and poiſoned many who had named him for their heir, to have the immediate poſſeſſion of their fortunes. He ſet up a brothel in his own palace, by which he gained conſiderable ſums by all the methods of proſtitution. He alſo kept a gaming-houſe, in which he himſelf preſided, lcrupling none of the meaneſt tricks in order to advance his gains. On a certain occaſion having had a run of ill luck, he faw two rich knights paſſing through his court; upon which he ſuddenly roſe up, and cauſing both to be apprehended, conſiſcated their eſtates, and then joining his former companions, boaſted that he never had a better throw in his life. Another time, wanting money for a ſtake, he went down and cauſed ſeveral noblemen to be put to death ; and then returning, told the company that they ſat playing for trifles while he had won 60,000 ſeſterces at a caſt.</p><p>Suςh inſupportable and capricious cruelties produced many ſecret conſpiracies againſt him ; but theſe were ſor a while deferred, upon account of his intended expedition againſt the Germans and Britons, which he undertook in the third year of his reign. For this purpoſe, he cauſed numerous levies to be made in all parts of the empire ; and talked with ſo much reſolution, that it was univerſally believed he would conquer all before him. His march perfectly indicated the inequality of his temper : ſometimes it was ſo rapid, that the cohorts were obliged to leave their ſtandards behind them ; at other times it was ſo flow, that it more reſembled a pompous proceſſion than a military expe» dition. In this diſpoſition he would cauſe himſelſ to be carried on eight mens ſhoulders, and order all the</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
