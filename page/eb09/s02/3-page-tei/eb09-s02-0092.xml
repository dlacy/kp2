Sacred art lay outside his ordinary routine, yet in the churches of St Ludwig and St Mariahilf he gave proof of the widest versatility. The Ruhmeshalle afforded further gauge of unexampled power of production ; here alone is work which, if adequately studied, might have occupied a lifetime ; ninety-two metopes, and, conspicuously, the giant figure of Bavaria, 60 feet high, rank among the boldest feats of physical force. A short life of forty-six years did not permit serious undertakings beyond the Bavarian capital, yet time was found for the groups within the north pediment of the Walhalla, Ratisbon, and also for numerous portrait statues, including those of Mozart, Jean Paul Richter, Goethe, and Shakespeare. Schwanthaler died at Munich in 1848, and left by will to the Munich academy all his models and studies, which now form the Schwanthaler Museum. The sculptor’s style may be designated as romantic-classic or modern-antique, and its conventional ideal stands far removed from the schools of naturalism and of realism.</p><p>SCHWARZ, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Schwartz, Christian Friedrich </hi>(1726-1798), Protestant missionary to India, was born on 8th October 1726 at Sonnenburg, in the electorate of Brandenburg, Prussia. After attending the grammar school of his native town and an academy at Küstrin, he in 1746 entered the university of Halle. Having learned Tamil to assist in a translation of the Bible into that language, he was led to form the intention of becoming a missionary to India. He received ordination at Copenhagen on the 8th August 1749, and, after spending some time in England to acquire the English language, embarked early in 1750 for India, and arrived at Trichinopoly on the 30th July. Tranquebar was for some time his headquarters, but he paid frequent visits to Tanjore and Trichinopoly, and in 1766 removed to the latter place. Here he acted as chaplain to the garrison, who erected a church for his general use. In 1769 he secured the friendship of the rajah of Tanjore, who, although he never embraced Christianity, afforded him every countenance in his missionary labours. Shortly before his death he committed to Schwarz the education of his adopted son and successor. In 1779 Schwarz undertook, at the request of the Madras Government, a private embassy to Hyder Ali, the chief of Mysore. When Hyder invaded the Carnatic, Schwarz was allowed to pass through the enemy’s encampment without molestation. After twelve years in Trichinopoly he removed to Tanjore, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died on 13th February 1798. Schwarz’s direct success in making converts exceeded that of any other Protestant missionary in India, in addition to which he succeeded in winning the esteem of Mohammedans and Hindus. The rajah of Tanjore erected a monument, executed by Flaxman, in the mission church, in which he is represented as grasping the hand of the dying missionary and receiving his benediction. A splendid monument to Schwarz by Bacon was placed by the East India Company in St Mary’s church at Madras.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Remains</hi> of Schwarz, with a sketch of his life, 1826 ; <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Life and Correspondence,</hi> by H.

See plate V. As the dignity of prince is held in virtue of the Oberherrschaft alone, a share of both baronies was given to each sub-line of the main house. The total area of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is 363 square miles, of which 283 are in the upper and 80 in the lower barony ; the chief towns in the former district are Rudolstadt (8747 inhabitants), the capital, and Blankenburg (1889), and in the latter Frankenhausen (4985). Both baronies are hilly, but no great height is anywhere attained. The scenery of the Thuringian portion of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt attracts many visitors annually, the most beautiful spots being the gorge of the Schwarza and the lovely circular valley in which the village of Schwarzburg nestles at the foot of a curiously isolated hill, crowned by the ancient castle of the princely line. Cattle-rearing and fruit-growing flourish in the lower barony, while the upper barony is finely wooded. Of the whole country 44 per cent. is under forest (mainly coniferous trees), and 41 per cent. is devoted to agriculture. The chief grain crops are rye, oats, and barley, but in 1883 thrice as much ground was occupied by potatoes as by all these three together. The live-stock returns in 1883 showed 19,831 cattle, 39,024 sheep, 19,544 pigs, 14,420 goats, and 2813 horses. Agriculture and forestry support about 35 per cent. of the population, and mining and cognate industries about 10 per cent. Trade and manufactures are insignificant ; iron, lignite, cobalt, alum, and vitriol are among the mineral productions. In 1880 the population was 80,296 (an increase of 1779 since 1875), or about 221 to the square mile. Of these 79,832 were Protestants.</p><p>Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is a limited hereditary sovereignty, its constitution resting on laws of 1854 and 1870, though a diet has met at intervals since 1816. The present diet consists of sixteen members elected for six years, four chosen by the highest taxpayers, the others by general election. The diet must be summoned every three years. The budget for 1885-87 estimated revenue and expenditure each at £101,210 ; £57,670 was the estimated income from the public lands and forests. The public debt was £230,350. The troops of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt have been incorporated with the Prussian army since the convention of 1867. The principality has one vote in the Reichstag and one in the federal council.</p><p>Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is the cadet branch of the family. In 1710 the count was made a prince, in spite of the remonstrances of the elector of Saxony, although he was prevented from taking his seat in the imperial college until 1754. The principality entered the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807 and the German League in 1815. In 1819 it redeemed the Prussian claims of superiority by surrendering portions of its territory.</p><p>SCHWARZBURG-SONDERSHAUSEN, a small Thuringian principality and an independent member of the German empire, shares the old Schwarzburg lands with Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, as explained in the preceding article. Its total area is 333 square miles, of which 133 are in the upper and 200 in the lower barony. The chief towns are Arnstadt (10,516 inhabitants), which at one time gave name to a line of counts, in the latter district, and Sondershausen (6110), the capital, in the former. The general description of the nature and resources of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt applies also to this principality, except that 58 per cent. of the whole is devoted to agriculture and 30 per cent. to forests, only about two-fifths of which are coniferous trees. The chief crops are oats, barley, wheat, and rye ; but here also by far the most land is planted with potatoes. In 1883 the principality contained 21,205 cattle, 54,276 sheep, 22,884 pigs, 11,372 goats, and 4283 horses. About 39 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture and forestry, and about 5 per cent. by mining. In 1880 the population was 71,107 (an increase of 3627 since 1875), or about 213 to the square mile. Of these 70,450 were Protestants.</p><p>Schwarzburg-Sondershausen is a limited hereditary sovereignty, its constitution resting on a law of 1857. The diet consists of five representatives elected by the highest taxpayers, five by general election, and not more than five nominated for life by the prince.</p></body></text></TEI>
