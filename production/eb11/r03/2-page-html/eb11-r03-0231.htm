<p><span class="font0">pseudo-Callisthenes and “ Julius Valerius ” applied to the historical wars of Alexander, but there is every reason to belicvè that it was done fairly early. In short, during the late classical&nbsp;or semi-classical times and the whole of the dark ages, things&nbsp;were making for romance in almost every direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It would and did follow from this that the thing evolved itself in so many different places and in so many different&nbsp;forms that only a person of extraordinary temerity would put&nbsp;his finger on any given work and say, “ This is the first romance,”&nbsp;even putting aside the extreme chronological uncertainty of&nbsp;most of the documents that could be selected for such a position.&nbsp;Except by the most meteoric flights of “ higher ” criticism wc&nbsp;cannot attain to any opinion as to the age and first developed&nbsp;form of such a story as that of Weland and Beadohild (referred&nbsp;to in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Complaint of Dear),</span><span class="font0"> which has strong romantic pos&nbsp;sibilitics and must be almost of the oldest. The&nbsp;much more complicated Volsung and Nibelung story,&nbsp;though we may explore to some-extent the existence&nbsp;backwards of its Norse and German forms, baffles us beyond&nbsp;certain points in each case; yet this, with the exception of the&nbsp;religious element, is romance almost achieved. And the origin&nbsp;of the great type of the romance that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font0"> achieved—that has&nbsp;all elements present and brings them to absolute perfection&nbsp;—the Arthurian legend, despite the immense labours that have&nbsp;been spent upon it and the valuable additions to particular&nbsp;knowledge which have resulted from some of them, is, still&nbsp;more than its own Grail, a quest unachieved, probably a thing&nbsp;unachievable. The longest and the widest inquiries, provided&nbsp;only that they be conducted in any spirit save that which determines to attain certainty and therefore concludes that certainty&nbsp;has been attained, will probably acquiesce most resignedly in&nbsp;the dictum that romance “ grew ”—that its birthplace is as</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">unknown as the grave of its greatest representative figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But when it has “ grown ” to a certain stage we can find it, and in a way localize it, and more definitely still analyse&nbsp;and comprehend its characteristics from their concrete expressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Approaching these concrete expressions, then, without at first too hard and fast requirements in regard to the validation&nbsp;of the claims, we find in Europe about the nth century (the time is designedly left loose) divers classes&nbsp;of what we should now call imaginative or fictitious&nbsp;literature, nearly all (the exceptions are Scandinavian and&nbsp;Old English) in verse. These are: (i) The saints’ lives;&nbsp;(ii) the Norse sagas, roughly so-called; (iii) the French&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste,</span><span class="font0"> (iv) the Old English and Old German stories&nbsp;of various kinds; (v) perhaps the beginning of the Arthurian</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cycle; (vi) various stories more or less based on classical , legend or history from the tales of Alexander and of Troy down&nbsp;to things like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apollonius of Tyre,</span><span class="font0"> which have no classical authority of either kind, but strongly resemble the Greek romances,&nbsp;and which were, as in the case named, pretty certainly derived&nbsp;from members of the class; (vii) certain fragments of Eastern&nbsp;story making their way first, it may be, through Spain by pilgrimages, latterly by the crusades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, without attempting to fence off too rigidly the classical 'from the romantic, it may be laid down that these various&nbsp;classes possess that romantic character, to which we are, by&nbsp;a process of netting and tracking, slowly making our way. in&nbsp;rather different degrees, and a Shortexamination of The difference will forward us not a little in the hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With i. (the saints’ Hves) we have least to do: because by the time that romance in the full sense comes largely and&nbsp;clearly into view, it has for the most part separated itself off&nbsp;—the legend of St Eustace has become the romance of Sir&nbsp;Isumbras, and so forth. But the influence which it may, as&nbsp;has been said, have originally given must have been continually&nbsp;re-exerted; the romantic-dynamic suggestion of such stories&nbsp;as those of St Mary of Egypt, of St Margaret and the Dragon,&nbsp;of St Dorothea, and of scores of others, is quite unmistakable.&nbsp;Still, in actual result, it works rather more on drama than on&nbsp;narrative romance, and produces the miracle plays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In ii. (the sagas), while a large part of their matter and even not a little of their form arc strongly romantic, differences of&nbsp;handling and still more of temper have made some demur to&nbsp;their inclusion under romance, while their final ousting in their&nbsp;own Htcraturcs by versions of the aU-conquering French romance&nbsp;itself is an argument on the same side. But the Volsung story,&nbsp;for instance, is full of what may be called “ undistilled ” romance&nbsp;—the wine is there, but it has to be passed through the stfll—&nbsp;and even in the most domestic sagas proper this characteristic&nbsp;is largely present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is somewhat less so in iii. (the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste),</span><span class="font0"> at least in the apparently older ones, though here again the comparative absence of romantic characteristics has been rather&nbsp;exaggerated, in consequence of the habit of paying disproportionate and even exclusive attention to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson de&nbsp;Roland.</span><span class="font0"> There is more, that is, of romance in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aliscans</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;others of the older class, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amis and Amiles,</span><span class="font0"> which must&nbsp;be of this class in time, is almost a complete romance, blending&nbsp;war, love and religion—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">solus, venus, virtus—</span><span class="font0">in full degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The other four classes, the misccUancous stories from classical, Eastern and European sources, having less corporate or national&nbsp;character, lend themselves with greater case to the conditions of&nbsp;romantic development; but even so in different degrees. The&nbsp;classical stories have to drop most of their original character&nbsp;and allow something very different to be superinduced before they&nbsp;becomef thoroughly romantic. The greatest success of all in this&nbsp;way is the story of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Troilus and Cressida.</span><span class="font0"> For before its development through the successive hands of Benoît* de Sainte-More,&nbsp;Boccaccio (for we may drop Guido of the Columns as a mere&nbsp;middleman between Benoît and Boccaccio) and Chaucer, it has&nbsp;next to no classical authority of any kind except the mere names.&nbsp;In the various Alexandreids the element of the marveUous—&nbsp;the Eastern element, that is to say—similarly overpowers the&nbsp;classical. As for the Eastern stories themselves, they arc&nbsp;particularly difficult of certain unravelment. The large moral&nbsp;division—such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Barlaam and Josaphat,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Wise&nbsp;Masters</span><span class="font0"> in its various forms, &amp;c., comes short of the strictly&nbsp;romantic. * We do not know how much of East and how much&nbsp;of West there is in such things as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flore et Blanchefleur</span><span class="font0"> or even&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Huon of Bordeaux</span><span class="font0"> itself. Contrariwise we ought to know,&nbsp;more certainly than apparently is known yet, what is the&nbsp;date and history of such a thing as that story of Zumurrud and&nbsp;AH Shahr, which may be found partly in Lane and fully in the&nbsp;complete translations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arabian Nights,</span><span class="font0"> though not in the&nbsp;commoner editions, and which is evidently either copied from,&nbsp;or capable of serving as model to, a Western </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roman d’aventures&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We come, however, much closer to the actual norm itself— closer, in fact, than in any other place save one—in the various&nbsp;stories, English, French, and to a less extent German,@@<sup>1</sup> which&nbsp;gradually received in a loose kind of way the technical French&nbsp;term just used, a term .not to be translated without danger.&nbsp;Nearly aU these stories were drawn, by the astonishing centripetal tendency which made France the home of all romance&nbsp;between the nth and the 13th centuries, into French forms;&nbsp;and in most cases no older ones survive. But it is hardly&nbsp;possible to doubt that in such a case, for instance, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Havelok,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">an original story of English or Scandinavian origin got itself&nbsp;into existence before, and perhaps long before, the French&nbsp;version was retransferred to EngHsh, and so in other cases.&nbsp;If, once more, we take our existing EngHsh </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Havdok</span><span class="font0"> and its&nbsp;sister </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King Horn,</span><span class="font0"> we see that the latter is a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font0"> romanced form&nbsp;than the former. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Havelok</span><span class="font0"> is more like a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste</span><span class="font0">—the&nbsp;love interest in it is very slight; while in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King Horn</span><span class="font0"> it is much&nbsp;stronger, and the increased strength is shown by the heroine&nbsp;being in some forms promoted into the title. If these two&nbsp;be studied side by side the process of transforming the mere&nbsp;story into the fuU romance is to no small extent seen in actual</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> Italian romance seems to have modelled itself early on French, and it is doubtful, rich as is the late crop of Spanish romances,&nbsp;whether we have any that deserve the name strictly and are really&nbsp;early.</span></p>
