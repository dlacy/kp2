<p><span class="font2">estates of the realm, are just as much part of “ the people,” in the widest sense, as “ the commons ” are; they are an integral&nbsp;part of the nation. In a republic they would as individuals be&nbsp;equal citizens, able to become candidates for the representative&nbsp;chamber or chambers; but as it is, since they are expressly&nbsp;debarred from taking part in elections to the House of Commons,&nbsp;they remain entitled and expected to use their historic method&nbsp;of playing a part in the government of the state. They assist&nbsp;to constitute “ the people ” in the wider sense, and in the&nbsp;narrower sense “ the people ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font2"> the commons) know it and&nbsp;rely on it. · Under the British constitution the commons have&nbsp;habitually relied on the monarchy and the House of Lords to&nbsp;play their part in the state, and on many occasions it has been&nbsp;proved, by various methods by which it is open to the commons&nbsp;themselves to show their real feeling, that action on the part of&nbsp;the monarch </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font2"> in foreign affairs) or the House of Lords (in&nbsp;rejecting or modifying bills sent up by the House of Commons),&nbsp;in which a popular vote has played no initiating or controlling&nbsp;part, is welcomed and ratified, by consent of a large majority,&nbsp;on the part of the nation at large. So much is this so that it is&nbsp;notorious, in the case of the House of Lords, that elected members&nbsp;of the House of Commons, tied by purely party allegiance and&nbsp;pledges, have constantly voted for a measure they did not want&nbsp;to see passed, relying on the House of Lords to throw it out.&nbsp;Ultimately, no doubt, the reconciliation of this “ presentative ”&nbsp;element in the British form of constitution with the -growth of&nbsp;democracy and the predominance of the “ representative ”&nbsp;system depends purely on the waiving of historical theory both&nbsp;by king and peers, and its adaptation to the fact of popular&nbsp;government through the recognition that their action rests for&nbsp;its efficient authority upon conformity with the “ will of the&nbsp;people.” Thus it has become an established maxim in England&nbsp;that while it is the proper function of the House of Lords to&nbsp;reject a measure which in their opinion is not in accordance with&nbsp;the wishes of the nation, they could not repeat such a rejection&nbsp;after a general election had shown that its authors in the House&nbsp;of Commons were supported by the country. The experience&nbsp;of. politics from 183 2 to 1910 gave abundant justification to the&nbsp;House of Lords for supposing that in such cases they were&nbsp;interpreting the desire of the country better than the House of&nbsp;Commons; the case of the Irish Home Rule bill of 1893 is, of&nbsp;course, the classical example.@@<sup>1</sup> So that in practice the House&nbsp;of Lords only acts in opposition to the House of Commons,&nbsp;subject to the remedy of a dissolution of parliament (which&nbsp;depends strictly on the prerogative of the Crown, but in practice&nbsp;on the advice of the leader of the majority in the House of&nbsp;Commons), at which the view of the House of Commons might&nbsp;be confirmed and reasserted, and in that case would prevail.&nbsp;The violent attacks made on the House of Lords by the Liberal&nbsp;party, on occasions when that party has had a majority in the&nbsp;commons and has had its measures rejected or distastefully&nbsp;amended, have always been open to the criticism that if the&nbsp;majority in the House of Commons were really supported by the&nbsp;electorate in the country they had the remedy in their own hands.&nbsp;If it were shown by the result of a general election that their&nbsp;defeated measure were the “ will of the people,” the House of&nbsp;Lords, as was generally understood, must give way. Such a&nbsp;position, though naturally objectionable to a party in power in&nbsp;the House of Commons (because general elections are uncertain&nbsp;things in every respect but that of trouble and expense), could&nbsp;clearly be strong only in view of the confidence of the House of&nbsp;Lords in its action being more truly representative of public&nbsp;opinion. It therefore must be said to have acted, however&nbsp;clumsily and indirectly—and no direct way would be feasible&nbsp;except that of the Referendum—as a “ representative ” body,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> as carrying out what it judged to be the national will and&nbsp;not merely the will of the peers, although not constituted as&nbsp;such in the narrower sense. In practice, and in accordance&nbsp;with this view, it has on more than one occasion </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font2"> in the case&nbsp;of the Trades Disputes Act of 1906) accepted and passed measures&nbsp;which it was notorious, and indeed avowed, that the peers,&nbsp;themselves regarded as bad.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> The result of the general election of January 1910, following on the rejection of the Budget by the House of Lords, cannot properly&nbsp;be said to show anything to the contrary. Tt was notorious that&nbsp;there was no genuine majority in the new House of Commons for&nbsp;the Budget, and that the Irish Nationalists only voted for it as part&nbsp;of an arrangement for ulterior purposes.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">The immense extension of the “ representative principle ” in government, by means of popular election, and its adaptation&nbsp;to municipal as well as national councils, has in recent&nbsp;times resulted in attracting much attention to the&nbsp;problem of making such elected bodies more accurately&nbsp;representative of public opinion than they frequently&nbsp;are. There are three distinct problems involved—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) that of making the number of enfranchised citizens correspond to a real embodiment of the nation; (2) that&nbsp;of getting candidates to stand for the office of representative&nbsp;who are competent and incorruptible exponents of the national&nbsp;will, and (3) that of adopting a system of voting which shall&nbsp;result in the elected representatives forming an assembly which&nbsp;shall adequately reflect the balance of opinion in the electorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) The history of the gradual extension of the franchise in the United Kingdom is given under </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Parliament,</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;conditions for other countries under their respective&nbsp;headings. But while, in countries with a representative&nbsp;system at all, the question as to the extent to which&nbsp;the male citizens shall have the vote is mainly one of degree—as&nbsp;to property or other qualification, up to the inclusion of all&nbsp;adults (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vote and Voting)</span><span class="font2">—the question of the incapacity&nbsp;of women, as a sex, raises a distinction which is more radical.&nbsp;The facts as to the progress of the movement for women’s&nbsp;suffrage are given in the article W<sup>f</sup>OMEN. It is only necessary&nbsp;to say here that, where the franchise is limited to the male&nbsp;sex, the theory of “no taxation without representation ” is&nbsp;under modem conditions of life carried out in a decidedly onesided way. The question of women’s suffrage is, however, one of&nbsp;public policy, in whatever state it is raised; and even where,&nbsp;as in Great Britain, it has been adopted for municipal affairs,&nbsp;a distinction is commonly made as regards the national assembly.&nbsp;So far as the historical facts as to the disability of women are&nbsp;concerned, it has been unanimously decided in England by the&nbsp;highest law-court of the realm (judgment of the House of Lords&nbsp;in the Edinburgh University case, December 1908), presided over&nbsp;on this occasion by a Liberal Lord Chancellor (Lord Loreburn),&nbsp;that, according to their authoritative Statementof the common&nbsp;law, women never had in earlier times any legal right to vote&nbsp;for members of parliament; this judgment is therefore entirely&nbsp;adverse to such ingenious arguments to the contrary as are ably&nbsp;expressed in Mrs Charlotte Carmichael Stopes’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">British Free-women</span><span class="font2"> (1907).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sex, however, apart, there are various interesting questions as to the principles which should govern the extension of the&nbsp;suffrage and its limitations, to which a brief reference may here&nbsp;be made. It is noteworthy that John Stuart Mill, the philosophical radical whose work on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Representative Government&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(first published in 1861) is a classic on the subject, and who&nbsp;regarded the representative system as the highest ideal of polity,&nbsp;made a good many reservations which have been ignored by&nbsp;those who frequently quote him. Mill’s ideal was by no means&nbsp;that popular government should involve a mere counting of&nbsp;heads, or absolute equality of value among the citizens. While&nbsp;holding that “ no arrangement of the suffrage can be permanently&nbsp;satisfactory in which any person or class is peremptorily excluded,&nbsp;or in which the electoral privilege is not open to all persons&nbsp;of full age who desire to obtain it,” he insisted on “ certain&nbsp;exclusions.” Thus he demanded that universal education should&nbsp;precede universal enfranchisement, and laid it down, that if&nbsp;education to the required amount had not become universally&nbsp;accessible and thus a hardship arose, this was “ a hardship .&nbsp;that had to be borne.” He would not grant the suffrage to&nbsp;any one who could not read, write and perform a sum in the rule&nbsp;of three. Further, he insisted on the electors being taxpayers,&nbsp;and emphasized the view that, as a condition annexed to&nbsp;representation, such taxation should descend to the poorest class</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
