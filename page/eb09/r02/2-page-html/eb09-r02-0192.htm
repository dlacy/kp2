<p><span class="font0">form which has existed down </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">the present time amongst all the Orientals who follow the Greek rite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Melchites.—</span><span class="font0">The Melchites (see Melchites) have the Greek rite in the Arab language. They are found scattered throughout Syria,&nbsp;Palestine, and Egypt, and have one patriarch and ten bishops&nbsp;ruling over from 70,000 to 80,000 souls. Their clergy are, for the&nbsp;most part, regular, following the rule of St Basil, and are divided&nbsp;into three congregations, —that of San Salvatore near Saida (Sidon)&nbsp;in Lebanon, with about 300 persons who mostly have the care of&nbsp;souls ; the second, of St John the Baptist', is at Scieur in Lebanon,&nbsp;with thirty members ; and the third is the congregation of Aleppo,&nbsp;at St George in Lebanon, with forty members between priests and&nbsp;brothers. A small group of secular clergy is attached to the patriarchate. Besides these there are about forty secular married priests&nbsp;throughout the dioceses. The patriarchal residence is Damascus,&nbsp;which has two bishops-vicars,—one in Damascus, the other in&nbsp;Egypt. The ten dioceses are Tyre, Hauran, Saida or Sidon,&nbsp;Ptolemais, Beyrout, Zakle, Baalbec, Emessa, Aleppo, and Tripoli.&nbsp;Thus there are twelve bishops in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulgarians.—</span><span class="font0">The United Bulgarians have the same Greek rite, with the mass in the Slav language. Their origin dates from&nbsp;1860, when many prelates and people passed over to the Catholic&nbsp;Church. At present (188δ) their numbers are somewhat diminished,&nbsp;amounting to about 9000 souls. They have one archbishop, who&nbsp;resides in Constantinople, a vicar-apostolic for Thrace, who resides&nbsp;in Adrianople, and another vicar-apostolic for Macedonia, who&nbsp;resides in Salonica. The Turkish Government officially recognizes&nbsp;them as Catholics. They are spread amongst the villages in Turkey&nbsp;and especially in Macedonia. Besides these there are in the diocese&nbsp;of Philippopolis about 15,000 Bulgarian Catholics who have embraced the Latin rite. These are administered by a vicar-apostolic&nbsp;of the order of Capuchins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iiuthenians.—</span><span class="font0">The Ruthenians attribute their conversion to Christianity to St Methodius (860) and his brother St Cyril. The Ruthenian rite is Greek in the vicinity of Greece and Latin in the&nbsp;countries of western Europe. The Slav is the language used in both&nbsp;rites. The Ruthenians are numerous in eastern and western&nbsp;Galicia, in Poland, and in Hungary. In Russia they have two&nbsp;dioceses. In Galicia they number about 2,600,000 with 2000&nbsp;priests ; in Hungary the two dioceses of Eperies and Munkacs&nbsp;count half a million of Catholics. In Galicia they have one metropolitan (Lemberg) and two bishops, in Hungary two bishops, and&nbsp;in Crisio one, with about 200 priests in these three dioceses. They&nbsp;have a Greek Ruthenian college at Rome and another in Vienna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Maronites.—</span><span class="font0">The greater number of the Maronites (&lt;∕.r.) are in Lebanon, where the patriarch resides ; others are in Syria, in Egypt,&nbsp;and in Cyprus. The patriarchal title is Antioch ; the archbishops&nbsp;are those of Aleppo, Archis, Berito, Damascus, Tyre and Sidon, and&nbsp;Tripoli ; the bishops of Cyprus, Heliopolis, and Gibail and Botri.&nbsp;The Maronites of Alexandria are administered by a procurator of&nbsp;the patriarch. The population of these dioceses is nearly 400,000.&nbsp;The number of regular priests is about 1200, of secular priests about&nbsp;600. In Mount Lebanon there are seventy-five convents of men and&nbsp;women. Five colleges or seminaries depend upon the patriarch and&nbsp;four others on the archbishops. In these seminaries the clerics&nbsp;learn Arabic, Syriac, Latin, French, and Italian. The language&nbsp;used in the mass and in the offices of the church is Syriac, that&nbsp;spoken by the people is Arabic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syro-Chaldxans.—</span><span class="font0">The Oriental Syrians are called, ecclesiastically, Chaldeans. This name comprises, not only the inhabitants of&nbsp;Chaldea, but also those of Assyria, Mesopotamia, and a part of&nbsp;Persia. To distinguish them from those having other rites equally&nbsp;Syrian, they were exclusively termed Chaldeans by Pope Eugenius&nbsp;IV. (1431-1447). Previous to the council of Florence (1438) they&nbsp;were called Orientals or Syro-Orientals. The Catholic Chaldeans&nbsp;have a patriarch who for a long period has had his residence at&nbsp;Mosul (Mesopotamia), and has the title of patriarch of Babylonia&nbsp;with archiépiscopal jurisdiction over the city of Baghdad. There&nbsp;are five archdioceses—Amida or Diarbekir in Mesopotamia, Seert&nbsp;in Assyria, Salmas and Adorbigana in Persia, Kerkuk (Carcha) in&nbsp;Parthic Assyria, and Amadia in Kurdistan. The dioceses are&nbsp;Mardin and Gezira in Mesopotamia, Zaku in Assyria-Media, Sena&nbsp;in Persia, Bassorah on the Persian Gulf, and Acri and Zebari in&nbsp;the mountains of Kurdistan. The number of secular clergy in the&nbsp;patriarchate, archdioceses, and dioceses approximates 200. There&nbsp;is a congregation of Antonian monks, having the title of S. Hor-misdas, who have an abbot-general, five houses or convents, forty&nbsp;priests, and a hundred monks. The other religious houses bear&nbsp;the names of Mother of God, St George, St Abraham, and St James.&nbsp;The largest number of Catholics is in the diocese of Mosul with&nbsp;Baghdad, 25,000. In all there are over 90,000 Catholics. The&nbsp;language of the mass and church office is Syro-Chaldaic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Copts.—</span><span class="font0">The Coptic rite prevails throughout all Egypt. At one time there was a liturgy of Lower and another of Upper Egypt. In&nbsp;the former the Memphitic dialect was in use and the Theban dialect&nbsp;in the latter. But as the patriarchs of Alexandria were Greeks they,&nbsp;followed by several churches in Egypt, changed the liturgy into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Greek language ; and after the schism in the 5th century the liturgy became Coptic, as the patriarchs were Copts. There are three&nbsp;liturgies in use at present—that of St Basil, that of St Gregory&nbsp;Nazianzen, and that of St Mark, rearranged by St Cyril of Alexandria. The Theban dialect is no longer used ; but the Memphitic&nbsp;still prevails, and in it the offices of the church are recited. The&nbsp;Catholic population is only about 6000, with twenty-two priests,&nbsp;one bishop, and a vicar-apostolic, whose residence is at Cairo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Armenians.—</span><span class="font0">The Armenians (see Armenian Church) regard St Gregory the Illuminator as their apostle. Pope Benedict XIV.&nbsp;instituted the patriarchate of Cilicia in 1742, and Pius VIII. in&nbsp;1830 instituted the Armenian Catholic primacy in Constantinople.&nbsp;In 1867 Pius IX. united Cilicia with the primacy of Constantinople,&nbsp;so that the patriarch now bears the title of Cilicia and has his&nbsp;residence in Constantinople. Turkey, Russia, Asia Minor, Armenia&nbsp;(Greater and Lesser), Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt have Armenian&nbsp;Catholics, who altogether number 100,000 at the present time (1885).&nbsp;There are ten archbishops and bishops and over 350 priests. They&nbsp;also possess religious orders, the Mechitarists of Venice and of&nbsp;Vienna, and have an Armenian college at Rome and an Armenian&nbsp;seminary at Bzommar in Mount Lebanon. The liturgical language&nbsp;is literary Armenian, and they have a special rite and liturgy. The&nbsp;people speak vulgar Armenian and Turkish. There is an institute&nbsp;of Armenian sisters of the Immaculate Conception at Constantinople&nbsp;to attend to the education of young girls, especially those newly&nbsp;converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roumanians.—</span><span class="font0">As early as the council of Florence the Roumanian metropolitan of Moldavia subscribed the decree of union ; but the&nbsp;time had not yet come for an actual union with Rome. In 1700,&nbsp;under the metropolitan Theophilus and his successor Athanasius I.,&nbsp;the great national synod of Alba Julia (Fogaras) was held, in which&nbsp;the bishop, the archpriests, and all the clergy of the Roumanian&nbsp;Church of Transylvania “freely and spontaneously by the impulse&nbsp;of God” concluded a union with the Roman Catholic Church. This&nbsp;declaration was signed by the metropolitan, by fifty-four archpriests&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(protoρapas'),</span><span class="font0"> and by 1561 priests. Historians say that 200,000&nbsp;families were united to Rome on that day. Some afterwards again&nbsp;fell away, but there is at present a great movement prevailing&nbsp;amongst these towards union. The United Catholics are chiefly in&nbsp;Transylvania and Hungary and number about a million and a half,&nbsp;with from 1500 to 1600 priests. In 1854 Pius IX. erected into an&nbsp;ecclesiastical province the United Roumanian Church with an archbishopric, Alba Julia (Fogaras), and three bishoprics. To the diocese&nbsp;of Grosswardein in Hungary was added that of Lugos in the Banat&nbsp;and that of Armenopolis (Samos-Ujvar), which constitute a flourishing ecclesiastical province. For the education of the clergy four&nbsp;places for students were given by Pius IX. in the Greek college at&nbsp;Rome, and they have sixteen places in the central seminary of&nbsp;Budapest. They have two seminaries, one in the metropolitan&nbsp;diocese, with fifty and another at Armenopolis with sixty students.&nbsp;In the diocese of Armenopolis the number of souls is 647,666, with&nbsp;486 parishes and a monastery. In the archdiocese of Alba Julia&nbsp;the number is 361,000, with 729 parishes and 706 priests. At&nbsp;Grosswardein and Lugos the number of Catholics is less. The rite&nbsp;in use is the Greek, but the language is the Roumanian. This is&nbsp;the only rite which employs the vulgar tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P. L. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">English Law relating to Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of the old penal laws against Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom has been sketched in the&nbsp;articles England and Ireland.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> The principal English&nbsp;Acts directed against “ popish recusants ” </span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> will be found&nbsp;in the list given in the Acts repealing them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(7</span><span class="font1"> and 8 Viet,&nbsp;c. 102; 9 and 10 Viet. c. 59). The principal Scottish&nbsp;Act was 1700, c. 3 ; the principal Irish Act, 2 Anne c. 3.&nbsp;Numerous decisions illustrating the practical operation of&nbsp;the old law in Ireland are collected in Howard’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cases on&nbsp;the Popery Laws,</span><span class="font1"> 1775. .The Roman Catholic Emancipation Act, 1829 (10 Geo. IV. c. 7), although it gave Roman&nbsp;Catholic citizens in the main complete civil and religious&nbsp;liberty, at the same time left them under certain disabilities,&nbsp;trifling in comparison with those under which they laboured&nbsp;before 1829. Nor did the Act affect in any way the long&nbsp;series of old statutes directed against the assumption of&nbsp;authority by the Roman see in England. The earliest of&nbsp;these which is still law is the Statute of Provisors of 1351&nbsp;(25 Edw. III. st. 4). Most of what has been already stated</span></p>
