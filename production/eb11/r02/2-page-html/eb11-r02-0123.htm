<p><span class="font0">passing the distal portion of the extra-columella, part of the hyoid fuses with it, often forming thereby a Uttle hole, the&nbsp;remnant of imperfect fusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the crocodiles the arrangement is at first complete and diagrammatically clear, not obscured by vagaries of the hyoid,&nbsp;which is free and much reduced. In tbe embryo the large&nbsp;extra-columellar cartilage, abutting against the tympanic&nbsp;membrane, and with another process against the quadrate,&nbsp;sends its third, downward, process as a thick rod of cartilage&nbsp;to the posterior inner angle of tbe mandible with which it is&nbsp;directly in cartilaginous continuity. It was W. K. Parker’s&nbsp;mistake to call this cartilage the cerato-hyal. In young embryos&nbsp;it looks like an upward continuation of Meckel’s cartilage, much&nbsp;resembling mammalian conditions. But in nearly ripe embryos&nbsp;this cartilage is already reduced to a string of connective tissue,&nbsp;cartilage remaining only at the upper end, and where this string&nbsp;enters the mandible Ees the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">siphonium,</span><span class="font0"> the tube which connects&nbsp;the air cavities of the mandible with the Eustachian passages,&nbsp;the long connecting channel becoming—side by side with the&nbsp;extracolumellar-mandibular ligament—embedded into a canal&nbsp;of the quadrate, so that in older stages, and above all in the&nbsp;adult, the proper display of the whole arrangement requires a&nbsp;little anatomical skill. The whole string, whether cartilaginous&nbsp;or ligamentous, which connects the downward extracolumellar&nbsp;process with the articulare, is of course homologous with the&nbsp;continuation of Meckel’s cartilage into the malleus of foetal and&nbsp;young mammals; and the chain of bones and cartilages between&nbsp;the auditory capsule, fenestra ovalis, and the proximal part of&nbsp;the mandible is also homologous wherever such a chain occurs;&nbsp;lastly, fenestra ovalis and membrana tympani are fixed points.&nbsp;Consequently columella=Stapes, extracolumella of Sauropsida=&nbsp;lentiform+incus+malleus of Mammalia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inner ear</span><span class="font0"> has been studied minutely and well by C. Hasse, E. Clason and G. Retzius. It is enclosed by the periotic bones.&nbsp;The fenestra rotunda is surmounted by the opisthotic, the fenestra&nbsp;ovalis by the same and by the pro-otic, and this protects also&nbsp;the anterior vertical semicircular canal. The posterior canal is&nbsp;opisthotic, the horizontal is pro- and opisthotic. The anterior&nbsp;canal is the largest of the three, a feature characteristic of the&nbsp;Sauropsida. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lagena,</span><span class="font0"> with its own acoustic papilla, begins&nbsp;to show a basilar membrane with papilla, at the expense of&nbsp;that in the sacculus. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenadon</span><span class="font0"> and lizards a slight curving&nbsp;of the lagena indicates the beginning of a cochlea, and a scala is&nbsp;developed in crocodiles, but neither cochlea nor scala is specially&nbsp;twisted. The endo-lymphatic ducts end as closed sacs, in lizards&nbsp;and snakes, in the roof of the skull, between tbe occipital and&nbsp;parietal bones. They reach an enormous deveIopment in many&nbsp;geckos, where they form large twisted sacs beneath the skin,&nbsp;covering the sides of thc neck, which then assumes a much&nbsp;swollen appearance. They contain white otolithic masses, with&nbsp;lymph. It is remarkable that the extent of these sacs varies&nbsp;not only in allied species, but even individually, independent of&nbsp;sex and age, although they are naturalIy liable to increase with&nbsp;age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eyes</span><span class="font0"> are present in all reptiles, although in many of the&nbsp;burrowing snakes and lizards they may be so completely covered&nbsp;by the skin as to have lost their function. Most reptiles have&nbsp;upper and lower lids, moved by palpebral muscles, and a third&nbsp;lid, the nictitating membrane, which can be drawn over thc front&nbsp;of the cornea from the inner angle obliquely up and backwards.&nbsp;Its mechanism is simplest in lizards. A muscle, a split from the&nbsp;retractor muscle of the eyeball, arises from the posterior part of&nbsp;the orbit, is attached to the posterior wall of the eyeball, and&nbsp;there forms a pulley for the long tendon which arises from the&nbsp;median side of the orbit and passes over the back of the ball&nbsp;forwards into the nictitating [membrane. Contraction of this&nbsp;muscle draws the membrane backwards and over the eye. In&nbsp;crocodiles and tortoises the tendon of the nictitating membrane&nbsp;broadens out into a muscle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(M. pyramidalis),</span><span class="font0"> which arises from&nbsp;the median side of the posterior portion of the ball; above thc&nbsp;optic nerve it crosses over the broad insertion of the retractor&nbsp;of the ball, without being much guided by it, although this&nbsp;muscle by its contraction slightly prevents the nictitating tendon&nbsp;and muscle from touching the optic nerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is easy to recognize the mechanism of birds as a combination of the two types just described; their ,musc, quadrates s. bursalis is of course the single muscle of the lizards, but now&nbsp;restricted to, and broadened out upon, the eyeball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Modifications of the Lids.—</span><span class="font0">In the snakes the upper and lower lids are reduced to the rim, and the nictitating membrane&nbsp;has become the permanent cover, which protects the eye like a&nbsp;watch-glass, leaving between itself and the cornea a space,&nbsp;drained by the naso-lacrymal duct, and behind this space the&nbsp;eyeball moves as freely as in other animals. A similar arrangement exists in th,e true geckos, not in the Eublepharidae, w hich&nbsp;still possess the outer lids. In some lizards, especially such as&nbsp;live in deserts, the middle of the Iower lid has a transparent&nbsp;disk, and it is always the lower lid which is drawn over the eye,&nbsp;the upper in nearly all Sauropsida being much smaller and less&nbsp;movable; for instance, some specimens of the Lacertine genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eremias</span><span class="font0"> in Africa and India. In the Indian genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cabrita,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophiops</span><span class="font0"> of Africa and India, the lower lid is permanently&nbsp;fused with the rim of the shrunken upper lid and forms a transparent window superficially looking like that of the snakes.&nbsp;Exactly the same arrangement has been developed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ablepharus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">one of the Scincidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The eyeball is provided with the usuaI rectus and obliquus muscles, in addition to a retractor oculi. Apparently all reptiles&nbsp;possess a pair of Harderian or nictitating glands, which open in&nbsp;front, in the nasal, inner comer, and lacrymal glands which&nbsp;open likewise into the conjunctival sac, but near the outer or&nbsp;temporal comer. The secretion of both is drained off through&nbsp;the lacrymal canals,' which in lizards open below in the outer&nbsp;wall of the posterior nares; in snakes they open into the&nbsp;mouth by a narrow aperture on the inner side of the palatine bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The walls of the anterior half of the sclerotic of lizards, tortoises and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenadon</span><span class="font0"> contain numerous cartilaginous or&nbsp;osseous plates, which imbricate in ring shape; they are absent&nbsp;in snakes and crocodiles. Internally the eye of most reptiles&nbsp;possesses at least traces of a pecten; very small indeed in&nbsp;tortoises, or in crocodiles where it is represented by only a few&nbsp;mosslike, pigmented vessels. In many lizards these vessels,&nbsp;arising from near the optic nerve, form a network which extends&nbsp;right up to the posterior side of the lens; in others, especially&nbsp;in Iguanidae, is developed a typical, large pecten, deeply&nbsp;pigmented with black, fan-shaped or umbrella-shaped, sometimes folded. In chameleons it is a short cone; apparently</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
