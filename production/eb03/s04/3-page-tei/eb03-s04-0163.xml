            <p>ry perſon who pretends to explain other phenomena in a ſimilar manner. Then, and not
                till then, he is able to ſay what classes of phenomena will admit of the explanation
                : and, when all this is done, his explanation is ſtill an <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypothesis,</hi> till he is able to prove, from other indisputable ſources, the
                exiſtence and agency of the ſame thing analogous to the elaſtic fluid, from which
                all is borrowed.</p>
            <p>Such conſiderations would juſtify us for conſidering with great attention the nature
                of sound. But a work like this will not give room for a full diſcuſſion ; and we
                muſt refer our readers to the writers who treat it more at large. Much curious
                information may be got from the pains-taking authors of the laſt century ; ſuch as
                Lord Bacon; Kircher; Merſennus ; Caſſerius in his great work <hi rend="italic">De
                    Voce et Auditu ;</hi> Perrault in his <hi rend="italic">Diſſertation du
                    Bruit</hi> ; Muſſenbroek in his great Syſtem of Natural Philosophy, in 3 vols
                4t0 ; and in his <hi rend="italic">Essais de Physique</hi> ; and the writings of the
                celebrated phyſiologiſts of the preſent age. We alſo refer to what has been ſaid by
                us in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics.</hi></p>
            <p>At preſent therefore we muſt content ourſelves with giving a ſhort hiſtory of the
                ſpeculations of philosophers on this ſubject, tracing out the ſteps by which we have
                arrived at the knowledge which we have of it. We apprehend this to be or great
                importance ; becauſe it ſhows us what kind of evidence we have for its truth, and
                the paths which we muſt ſhun if we wiſh to proceed farther: and we truſt that the
                progreſs which we have made will appear to be so real, and the object to be attained
                so alluring to a truly philoſophical mind, that men of genius will be incited to
                exert their utmoſt efforts to paſs the preſent boundaries of our real progress.</p>
            <p>In the infancy oſ philoſophy, sound was held to be a ſeparate exiſtence, ſomething
                which would be, although no hearing animal exiſted. This was conceived as wafted
                through the air to our organ of hearing, which it was ſuppoſed to affect in a manner
                reſembling that in which our noſtrils are affected when they give us the ſenſation
                of ſmell. It was one of the Platonic <hi rend="smallcaps">species, </hi>fitted for
                exciting the intellectual ſpecies, which is the immediate object of the soul’s
                contemplation.</p>
            <p>Yet, even in thoſe early years of ſcience, there were ſome, and, in particular, the
                celebrated founder oſ the ſtoic ſchool, who held that sound, that is, the cauſe of
                sound, was only the particular motion of external groſs matter, propagated to the
                ear, and there producing that agitation of the organ by which the soul is
                immediately affected with the ſenſation of sound. Zeno, as quoted by Diogenes
                Laertius@@*, ſays, “ Hearing is produced by the air which intervenes between the
                thing sounding and the ear. The air is agitated in a ſpherical form, and moves off
                in waves, and falls on the ear, in the ſame manner as the water in a ciſtern
                undulates in circles when a ſtone has been thrown into it.” The ancients were not
                remarkable for preciſion, either of conception or argument in their diſcuſſions, and
                they were contented with a general and vague view of things. Some followed the
                Platonic notions, and many the opinion of Zeno, but without any farther attempts to
                give a diſtinct conception of the explanation, or to compare it with experiment.</p>
            <p>But in later times, during the ardent reſearches in the laſt century into the
                phenomena of nature, this be</p>
            <p>came an intereſting ſubject of inquiry, the invention of the air-pump gave the firſt
                opportunity of deciding by experiment whether the elastic undulations of air were
                the cauſes of sound: and the trial fully eſtabliſhed this point ; for a bell rung
                    <hi rend="italic">in vacua</hi> gave no sound, and one rung in condenſed air
                gave a very loud one. It was therefore received as a doctrine in general phyſics
                that air was the vehicle of sound.</p>
            <p>The celebrated Galileo, the parent of mathematical philoſophy, diſcovered the nature
                of that connection between the lengths of muſical cords and the notes which they
                produced, which had been obſerved by Pythagoras, or learned by him in his travels in
                the eaſt, and which he made the foundation of a refined and beautiful ſcience, the
                theory of muſic. Galileo ſhowed, that the real connection subſiſted between the
                tones and the vibrations of theſe cords, and that their different degrees of
                acuteneſs corresponded to the different frequency of their vibrations The very
                elementary and familiar demonſtration which he gave of this connection did not
                ſatisfy the curious mathematicians of that inquiſitive age, and the mechanical
                theory of muſical cords was proſecuted to a great degree of refinement. In the
                courſe of this inveſtigation, it appeared that the cord vibrated in a manner
                preciſely ſimilar to a pendulum vibrating in a cycloid. It muſt therefore agitate
                the air contiguous to it in the ſame manner ; and thus there is a particular kind of
                agitation which the air <hi rend="italic">can</hi> receive and maintain, which is
                very intereſting.</p>
            <p>Sir Iſaac Newton took up this queſtion as worthy of his notice ; and endeavoured to
                aſcertain with mathematical preciſion the mechaniſm of this particular claſs of
                undulations, and gave us the fundamental theorems concerning the undulations of
                elaſtic fluids, which make the 47, &amp;c. propositions of Book II. of his
                Principles of Natural Philoſophy. They have been (perhaps haſtily) conſidered as
                giving the fundamental doctrines concerning the propagation of sound. They are
                therefore given in this work in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics</hi> ;
                and a variety of facts are narrated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics,
                </hi>to ſhow that ſuch undulations <hi rend="italic">actually obtain</hi> in the air
                of our atmoſphere, and are accompanied by a ſet of phenomena of sound which
                preciſely tally or correſpond to all the mechanical circumſtances of theſe
                undulations. In the mean time, the anatomiſts and phyſiologiſts were buſily employed
                in examining the ſtructure of our organs of hearing. Impreſſed with the validity of
                this doctrine of aerial undulations being the cauſes of sound, their reſearches were
                always directed with a view to diſcover thoſe circumſtances in the ſtructure of the
                ear which rendered it an organ ſuſceptible of agitations from this cauſe ; and they
                diſcovered many which appeared as contrivances for making it, a drum, on which the
                aerial undulations from without muſt make very forcible impulſes, so as to produce
                very sonorous undulations in the air contained in it. Theſe therefore they
                conſidered as the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> objects of ſenſation, or the
                immediate cauſes of sound.</p>
            <p>But ſome anatomiſts ſaw that this would not be a full account of the matter : for
                after a drum is agitated, it has done all that it can do ; it has produced a noiſe.
                But a farther proceſs goes on in our tar : here is behind the membrane, which is the
                head of this drum a curious mechanism, which communicates the agitations</p>
