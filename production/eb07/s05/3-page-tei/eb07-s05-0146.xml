Even the stern Achilles inquires anxiously after “ the wounded offspring of the healing god and the valiant Nestor, to whose care he is intrusted, is exhorted to unwonted exertion in his behalf; “ for a leech who, like him, knows how to cut out darts, and relieve the smarting of wounds by soothing unguents, is to armies more in value than many other heroes.” Podalirius enjoys the distinction of being reputed the first of phlebotomists, and probably the most successful, from his time to this ; having opened a vein in either arm of the king of Caria’s daughter, who had been severely injured by a fall from the house-top, having, after her recovery, been rewarded with the hand of the fair princess, and having been presented by her munificent father with the Chersonese as her dowry. As to medicine, they seem to have been either ignorant, or in no great repute ; for, on the breaking out of pestilence in the Grecian camp, Homer neglects them entirely, and applies at once to Apollo. And even their surgical attainments, for which they are celebrated by him, seem to have extended no farther than to the simple extraction of darts and other offensive weapons, the checking of hæmorrhage by styptics or pressure, and the application of lenitive salves. The poet takes notice of his warriors sustaining fracture of the bones ; but in such emergencies he adopts the same course as in the pestilence, and invokes the aid of the nonprofessional deities ; from which circumstance we may infer, that in those days surgery had made but little advancement.</p><p>For upwards of 600 years after the Trojan war. there are scarcely any accounts of medicine and surgery. They seem to have remained strangely stationary during the whole of that period. Their practice was confined to the Asclepiades, or reputed descendants of Æsculapius ; whose lore was orally communicated from father to son in that family, until they received an extraordinary impulse from the great Hippocrates, himself a branch of the family, and said to have been the fifteenth in lineal descent from the deified founder. The Asclepiades, in the course of their monopoly, established three schools of medicine, at Rhodes, at Cnidos, and at Cos. The last gave Hippocrates to the world, and thus attained a proud and enduring pre-eminence.</p><p>Pythagoras was the first who brought philosophy to bear upon the practice of the healing art, and led the way in raising it to the dignity of a science. Democritus, the happy sage, likewise turned his attention to medicine as a branch of general philosophy, and pursued it zealously. He lived in terms of friendship with Hippocrates, by whom he was held in great respect. By Pythagoras a school at Crotona was founded, about the time of Tarquinius Superbus, espousing doctrines somewhat different from those of Cos and Cnidos. It produced Damocedes, a contemporary of Pythagoras, who seems to have practised in Athens, an honoured and successful surgeon. By Polycrates, king of Samos, he was presented with two talents of gold for having cured him of a troublesome distemper. He was afterwards taken captive by the Persians. Their king, Darius, was intrusted to his care for a dislocated ancle, as well as the queen, Atossa, for a cancer of the breast ; and he was soon loaded with honour and wealth on account of his wonderful cures, performed after the Egyptian physicians, previously in attendance, had signally failed.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>human body must have been to them a profound mystery. And, knowing that anatomy is, was, and ever must be, the foundation of true surgical knowledge, we cannot evade the conviction that surgery, though occasionally successful and honoured in ancient times, must have been nothing more than a rude, imperfect, and uncertain art. The practice of its professors seems to have been extremely limited, consisting of little more than the binding up of wounds, and the staunching of hæmorrhage by styptics and the cautery ; the extraction of darts and other missiles from the wounds which they had inflicted ; phlebotomy, both general and local ; and cupping by scarification. Whether they practised the capital operations or not, we are not informed ; but it is probable that their comparative ignorance of anatomy effectually deterred them from any extensive division of the soft parts, as extremely hazardous and uncertain.Hippocrates, born in the 80th Olympiad, upwards of 400 years before the Christian era, did more for medicine and surgery than all who had preceded him ; and indeed few of those who have succeeded him have been of equal service to the profession. He soon freed medicine in a great measure from the absurdities with which ignorance and superstition had invested it; and through a long, honoured, and glorious life he set a splendid example of persevering industry, philosophical research, and high moral worth. His fame soon raised the Coan school far above its rivals. Though his anatomical knowledge seems little better than a blending of ingenuity with error, yet he appears to have had some indistinct notions of the circulation of the blood ; but Dr Pitcairne, in his “ Solutio Problematis de Inventoribus,” has sufficiently evinced that he was very far from anticipating the great discovery of Harvey. With all his deficiencies, and notwithstanding all the disadvantages under which he laboured, so correct was his observation, and so faithful his chronicling of disease, that many of his descriptions may be fairly inserted in our modern nosologies. Though his attention was chiefly directed towards the improvement and promotion of physic, now begirt with philosophy, and studied as a science, and though his practice was principally confined to the treatment of internal disease, yet he was not wholly inattentive to surgery. And his practice seems to have been tolerably bold and decisive ; for, in regard to external disease, it was with him a maxim, that “ w hen medicine failed, recourse should be had to the knife, and when the knife was unsuccessful, to fire ;” a substance of which all the ancient doctors seem to have been particularly fond, from Prometheus downwards. Hippocrates employed it not only in a variety of diseases, but in various forms. Sometimes he applied red-hot irons to the part ; sometimes he raised a conflagration on it, and of it, by a piece of wood dipped in boiling oil, or by burning a roll of flax after the manner of the modem moxa. He also made use of tents and issues, as more gentle means of counter-irritation. He seems to have performed the capital operations with boldness and success, excepting lithotomy, the practice of which appears to have been confined to a few who made it their exclusive study. He however recommends the removal of calculus, large and firmly lodged in the kidney, by incision ; adding, probably in apology for the daring of the procedure, that otherwise there are no hopes of a cure, and that the disease must prove fatal. He reduced dislocations, and set fractures, but clumsily and cruelly ; extracted the foetus with forceps when necessary ; and both used and abused the trepan, employing it not only in depression and other accidents of the cranium, but also in cases of headach, and other affections to which the operation was inapplicable. In cases of empyema and hydrothorax, after ascertaining by percussion that fluid was present in the cavity of the chest, he did not hesitate to make an incision between the ribs; and having allowed part of the fluid to escape, he placed a tent in the wound, and by withdrawing it regularly once a day, the whole was ulti-But we cannot suppose such men as Damocedes and the Asclepiades to have attained any great proficiency in surgery ; for the touch of a dead body was interdicted as a profanation both by Jew and Greek, and consequently they must have been almost entirely ignorant of anatomy. They may have understood something of the skeleton, from their practice amongst fractures and dislocations ; and they may have formed some general idea of the viscera, from researches in comparative anatomy, and from instruction by the Egyptians, whose practice in embalming afforded ampler scope for observation. But the minute structure of the</p></body></text></TEI>
