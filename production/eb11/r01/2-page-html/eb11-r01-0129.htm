<p><span class="font0">RANKE, LEOPOLD VON (1795-1886), German historian, was bom on the 20th or the 21st of December 1795, in the&nbsp;small town of Wichc, in Thuringia, which then formed part of&nbsp;the electorate of Saxony. His father, Gottlob Israel Ranke,&nbsp;was an advocate, but his ancestors, so far back as the family&nbsp;can be traced, had been ministers of religion. Leopold received&nbsp;his education first at Donndorf, a school established in an old&nbsp;monastery near his home, and then at the famous school of&nbsp;Schulpforta, whence he passed to the university of Halle and&nbsp;later to that of Berlin. His studies, both at school and&nbsp;university, were classical and theological. The great political&nbsp;events which occurred during his boyhood and youth seem to&nbsp;have had less effect on him than on many of his contemporaries,&nbsp;and he was not carried away either by enthusiastic admiration&nbsp;for Napoleon or by the patriotic fervour of 1813. Nor was&nbsp;he implicated in the political movements which during the&nbsp;following years attracted so many students; on the contrary,&nbsp;he already displayed that detachment of mind which was to&nbsp;be so characteristic of him. In 1818 he became a master in a&nbsp;school at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, thereby entering the service&nbsp;of the Prussian government. The headmaster of this school&nbsp;was Ernst Friedrich Poppo (1794-1866), a celebrated Grecian,&nbsp;and Ranke was entrusted with the teaching of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the scholar’s dislike of textbooks, he rapidly acquired a thorough knowledge of the ancient historians, quickly passed&nbsp;on to medieval times, and here it was that he formed as the&nbsp;ideal of his life the study of universal history, the works of&nbsp;God as displayed in the history of the human race. Here,&nbsp;too, he composed his first work, which deals with the period&nbsp;to which most of his life was to be devoted, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der&nbsp;römanischen und germanischen Völker 1494-1514</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin,&nbsp;1824). To this was appended a critical dissertation on the&nbsp;historians who had dealt with the period </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Zur Kritik neuerer&nbsp;Geschichtschreiber),</span><span class="font0"> which, showing as it did how untrustworthy&nbsp;was much of traditional history, was to be for modern history&nbsp;as epoch-marking as the critical work of Niebuhr had been in&nbsp;ancient history. A copy of the book was sent to the Prussian&nbsp;minister of education, Karl Albert Kamptz (1769-1849), the&nbsp;notorious hunter of democrats. Within a week Ranke received&nbsp;the promise of a post at Berlin, and in less than three months&nbsp;was appointed supernumerary professor in the university of&nbsp;that city, a striking instance of the promptitude with which&nbsp;the Prussian government recognized scientific merit when,&nbsp;as in Ranke’s case, it was free from dangerous political opinions.&nbsp;The connexion thus established in 1825 was to last for fifty&nbsp;years. At the Berlin Library Ranke found a collection of&nbsp;MS. records, chiefly Italian, dealing with the period of the&nbsp;Reformation; from a study of them he found how different&nbsp;were the real events as disclosed in contemporary documents&nbsp;from the history as recorded by most writers; and the result&nbsp;of his researches was embodied in his second work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fürsten und&nbsp;Völker von Südeuropa im 16 und 17 Jahrhundert</span><span class="font0"> (1827). In&nbsp;later editions the title of this book was altered to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Osmanen&nbsp;und die spanische Monarchie.</span><span class="font0"> It was now his ambition to&nbsp;continue his exploration of the new world thus opened to him.&nbsp;The Prussian government provided the means, and in&nbsp;September 1827 he started for Italy. His first sojourn was&nbsp;in Vienna, where the friendship of Gentz and the protection&nbsp;of Metternich opened to him the Venetian archives, of which&nbsp;many were preserved in that city—a virgin field, the value of&nbsp;which he first discovered, and which is still unexhausted.&nbsp;He found time, in addition, to write a short book on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Serbische&nbsp;Revolution</span><span class="font0"> (1829), from material supplied to him by Wuk&nbsp;Stephanowich, a Servian who had himself been witness of the&nbsp;scenes he related. This was afterwards expanded into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Serbien&nbsp;und die Türkei im 19 Jahrhundert</span><span class="font0"> (1879). In 1828 he at last&nbsp;crossed the Alps, and the next three years were spent in Italy.&nbsp;The recommendations of Metternich opened to him almost&nbsp;every library except the Vatican; and it was during these&nbsp;three years of study in Venice, Ferrara, Rome, Florence and&nbsp;other cities, that he obtained that acquaintance with European&nbsp;history which was to make him the first historian of his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Rome, as he said, he learned to see events from the inside. He wrote nothing but a critical examination of the story of&nbsp;Don Carlos, but he returned to Germany a master of his craft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For a time Ranke was now engaged in an occupation of a different nature, for he was appointed editor of a periodical&nbsp;in which Friedrich Perthes designed to defend the Prussian&nbsp;government against the democratic press. Ranke, contemptuous in politics, as in history, of the men who warped&nbsp;facts to support some abstract theory, especially disliked&nbsp;the doctrinaire liberalism so fashionable at the time. He&nbsp;hoped, by presenting facts as they were, to win the adhesion&nbsp;of all parties. We need not be surprised that he failed; men&nbsp;desired not the scientific treatment of politics, but satire and&nbsp;invective. Exposed thus to attack, his weakness, if not his&nbsp;venality, was long an article of faith among the liberals. He&nbsp;did not satisfy the Prussian conservatives, and after four&nbsp;years the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historische Politische Blatter</span><span class="font0"> came to an end. Two-thirds of the matter had been contributed by the editor, and&nbsp;the two stout volumes in which the numbers were collected&nbsp;contained the best political thought which had for long&nbsp;appeared in Germany. For Ranke the failure was not to&nbsp;be regretted; the rest of his life was to be wholly devoted to&nbsp;that in which he excelled. During 1834-36 appeared the&nbsp;three volumes of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die römischen Päpste, ihre Kirche und&nbsp;ihr Staat im 16 und 17 Jahrhundert</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 1834-36, and&nbsp;many other editions), in form, as in matter, the greatest of&nbsp;his works, containing the results of his studies in Italy. Henceforth his name was known in all European countries; the&nbsp;English translation by Mrs Austin was the occasion of one of&nbsp;Macaulay’s most brilliant essays. Before it was completed&nbsp;he had already begun the researches on which was based the&nbsp;second of his masterpieces, his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter&nbsp;der Reformation</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 1839-47), a necessary pendant to&nbsp;his book on the popes, and the most popular of his works in&nbsp;his own country. In 1837 he became full professor at Berlin;&nbsp;in 1841 Frederick William IV., always ready to recognize&nbsp;intellectual eminence, appointed him Prussian historiographer.&nbsp;Stimulated by this, he brought out his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Neun Bücher preussischer&nbsp;Geschichte</span><span class="font0"> (1847-48), a work which, chiefly owing to the&nbsp;nature of the subject, makes severe demands on the attention&nbsp;of the reader—he is the “ Dryasdust ’’ of Carlyle’s Frederick;&nbsp;but in it he laid the foundation for the modern appreciation&nbsp;of the founders of the Prussian state. The nine books were&nbsp;subsequently expanded to twelve (Leipzig, 1874). He took&nbsp;no immediate part in the movements of 1848, but in the&nbsp;following years he drew up several memoranda for the king,&nbsp;whom he encouraged in his efforts to defend the character&nbsp;and identity of the Prussian state against the revolutionaries.&nbsp;Though never admitted into the inner circle of the king’s&nbsp;associates, he found the king the most appreciative of readers&nbsp;and stimulating of companions, and the queen one of the&nbsp;most faithful of his friends; in biographical works and on&nbsp;other occasions he always defended the memory of the un-fortunate monarch. A friend even more sympathetic he&nbsp;found in Maximilian II. of Bavaria, whom he advised in his&nbsp;expansive schemes for the promotion of learning and letters.&nbsp;In the quieter years that followed he wrote the third of his&nbsp;masterpieces, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Französische Geschichte, vornehmlich im 16 und&nbsp;17 Jahrhundert</span><span class="font0"> (Stuttgart, 1852-61), which was followed&nbsp;by his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Englische Geschichte, vornehmlich im 16 und 17 Jahrhundert</span><span class="font0"> (1859-68). This, the longest of his works, added&nbsp;much to existing knowledge, especially as to the relations&nbsp;between England and the continent, but it lacked something&nbsp;of the freshness of his earlier books; he was over seventy&nbsp;when it was completed, and he was never quite at home in&nbsp;dealing with the parliamentary foundations of English public&nbsp;life. In his later years his small alert figure was one of the&nbsp;most distinguished in the society of Berlin, and every honour&nbsp;open to a man of letters was conferred upon him. He was&nbsp;ennobled in 1865, and in 1885 received the title of Excellenz.&nbsp;When the weakness of his eyes made it necessary for him to&nbsp;depend almost entirely on the service of readers and secretaries,</span></p>
