It is 15 miles broad between the southmost point of Sumatra and the town of Anjer in Java. Right in the middle is the low-lying well-wooded island of Dwars in den Weg, otherwise Middle Island or Sungian. In 1883 Sunda Strait was the scene of the most terrific results of the eruption of Krakatoa, a volcano on the west side of the strait. The greater part of the island of Krakatoa was destroyed and two new islands, Steers Island and Calmeyer Island, were thrown up.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
