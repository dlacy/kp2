(Dentatus), a tribune of the people, lived a little after the expulsion of the kings from Rome. He was in 120 battles and skirmiſhes, beſides ſingle combats, in all of which he came off conqueror. He ſerved under nine generals, all of whom triumphed by his means. In theſe battles he received 45 wounds in the fore-part of his body, and not one in his back. The ſenate made him great preſents, and he was honoured with the name of the Roman Achilles.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
