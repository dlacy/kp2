<p><span class="font0">in the beds of the streams; and extensive turf moors occupy many of the mountain slopes and valleys. The lower parts of the Riesenge-birge are clad with forests of oak, beech, pine and fir; above 1600 ft.&nbsp;only the last  two kinds of trees are found, and beyond about&nbsp;3950 ft. only the dwarf pine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pinus Pumilio).</span><span class="font0"> Various alpine&nbsp;plants are found on the Riesengebirge, some of them having been&nbsp;artificially introduced on the Schneekoppe. Wheat is grown at&nbsp;an elevation of 1800 ft. above the sea-level, and oats as high as&nbsp;2700 ft. The inhabitantsof this mountain region, who are tolerably&nbsp;numerous, especially on the Bohemian side, live for the most part,&nbsp;not in villages, but in scattered huts called “ Bauden.” They&nbsp;support themselves by the rearing of cattle, tillage, glass-making&nbsp;and linen-weaving. Mining is carried on only to a small extent for&nbsp;arsenic, although there are traces of former more extensive workings&nbsp;for Other metals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Riesengebirge has of late years been made easily accessible by railway, several branches from the main lines, both on the&nbsp;Silesian and Bohemian side, penetrating the valleys, and thus many&nbsp;spots in the Riesengebirge are a good deal frequented in the summer.&nbsp;The Schneekoppe and other summits are annually visited by a&nbsp;considerable number of travellers, notably the. spas of Warmbrunn&nbsp;(near Hirschberg) and Flinsberg on the Gneis, and Görbersdorf,&nbsp;known as a climate health resort for consumptives. The Ricsengc-birge is the legendary home of Number Nip (Rübezahl), a half-mischievous, half-friendly goblin of German folklore, and various&nbsp;localities in the group are more or less directly associated with his&nbsp;name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIETI (anc. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reate),</span><span class="font0"> a city and episcopal see of Italy, in the province of Perugia, 25J m. by rail and 15 m. direct S.S.E. of&nbsp;Terni, which is 70 m. by rail from Rome. Pop. (1901) 14,145&nbsp;(town), 17,716 (commune). It occupies a fine position 1318 ft.&nbsp;above sea-level on the right bank of the Velino (a torrent subtributary to the Tiber), which at this point issues from the&nbsp;limestone plateau; the old town occupies the declivity and the&nbsp;new town spreads out on tie level. While with its quaint red-roofed houses, its old town walls (restored about 1250), its castle,&nbsp;its cathedral (13th and 15th centuries), its episcopal palace&nbsp;(1283), and its various churches and convents Rieti has no small&nbsp;amount of medieval picturesqueness; it also displays a good deal&nbsp;of modern activity in vine and olive growing and cattle-breeding.&nbsp;The fertility of the neighbourhood is celebrated both by Virgil&nbsp;and by Cicero. A Roman bridge over the Turano, and the&nbsp;Palazzo Vincentini by Vignola deserve to be mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reate was reached from Rome by the Via Salaria </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> which may originally have ended there, and a branch road ran from it&nbsp;to Interamna. While hardly mentioned in connexion with the&nbsp;Punic or Civil Wars, Reate is described by Strabo as exhausted by&nbsp;these long contests. Its inhabitants received the Roman, franchise&nbsp;at the same time with the rest of the Sabines (290 b.c.), but it appears&nbsp;as a praefectura and not as a municipium down to the beginning&nbsp;of the empire. It was never made a colonia, though veterans of&nbsp;the Praetorian guard and of the eighth (Augusta) and ninth legions&nbsp;were settled there by Vespasian, who belonged to a Reatine family&nbsp;and was born in the neighbourhood. For the contests of the&nbsp;Reatines with the people of Interamna see Terni. In 1148 the town&nbsp;was besieged and captured by Roger I. of Sicily. In the struggle&nbsp;between church and empire it always held with the former; and it&nbsp;defied the forces of Frederick II. and Otho IV. Pope Nicholas IV.&nbsp;long resided at Rieti, and it was there he crowned Charles II. of&nbsp;Anjou king of the Two Sicilies. In the 14th century Robert, and&nbsp;afterwards Joanna, of Naples managed to keep possession of Rieti&nbsp;for many years, but it returned to the States of the Church under&nbsp;Gregory IX. About the year 1500, the liberties of the town, long&nbsp;defended against the encroachments of the popes, were entirely&nbsp;abolished. An earthquake in 1785 was in 1799 followed by the&nbsp;much more disastrous pillage of Rieti by the papal troops for a&nbsp;space of fourteen days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIETSCHEL, ERNST FRIEDRICH AUGUST (1804-1861), German sculptor, was born at Pulsnitz in Saxony. At an early&nbsp;age he became an art student at Dresden, and subsequently&nbsp;a pupil of Rauch in Berlin. He there gained an art studentship,&nbsp;and studied in Rome in 1827-28. After returning to Saxony&nbsp;he soon brought himself into notice by a colossal statue of&nbsp;Frederick Augustus, king of Saxony; was elected a member of&nbsp;the academy of Dresden, and thenceforth became one of the&nbsp;chief sculptors of his country. In 1832 he was elected to the&nbsp;Dresden professorship of sculpture, and had many foreign orders&nbsp;of merit conferred on him by the governments of different&nbsp;countries. He died at Dresden in 1861.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rictschers style was very varied; he produced works imbued, with much religious feeling, and to some extent he occupied the&nbsp;same place as a sculptor that Overbeck did in painting. Other&nbsp;important works by him were purely classical in style. He was&nbsp;specially famed for his portrait figures of eminent men, treated with&nbsp;much idealism and dramatic vigour; among the latter class his&nbsp;chief works were colossal statues of Goethe and Schiller for the&nbsp;town of Weimar, of Weber for Dresden and of Lessing for Brunswick.&nbsp;He also designed the memorial statue of Luther for Worms, but died&nbsp;before hecould carry it out. The principal among Rietschefs&nbsp;religious pieces of sculpture are the well-known Christ-Angel, and a&nbsp;life-sized Pietà, executed for the king of Prussia. He also worked a&nbsp;great deal in rilievo, and produced many graceful pieces, especially&nbsp;a fine series of bas-reliefs representing Night and Morning, Noon and&nbsp;Twilight, designed with much poetical feeling and imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For a good biography of Rietschel and account of his works see Appermann, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ernst Rietschel</span><span class="font0"> (Leipzig, 1863).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. H. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIEU, CHARLES PIERRE HENRI (1820-1902), Swiss Orientalist, was born at Geneva in 1820. He studied at Bonn&nbsp;University, where he received his doctor’s degree in 1843. He&nbsp;entered the British Museum in 1847, and after twenty years of&nbsp;service, a new post, that of keeper of Oriental manuscripts,&nbsp;was created for him. He completed in 1871 the second part,&nbsp;dealing with Arabian MSS., of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogus codùum manu-Scriptorum Orientalium<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font0"> which had been begun by William&nbsp;Cureton, and he issued a supplementary volume in 1894. He&nbsp;also drew up a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of the Turkish Manuscripts</span><span class="font0"> (1888)&nbsp;and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts</span><span class="font0"> (4 vols., 1879-95),&nbsp;the latter being a storehouse of information on the books and&nbsp;their authors. In 1895 he was made professor of Arabic in the&nbsp;university of Cambridge in succession to Robertson Smith. He&nbsp;died in London on the 19th of March 1902.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIEVAULX, a village in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, 3 m. W. by N. of the small town of Helmsley, which&nbsp;is served by a branch of the North-Eastern railway. Here,&nbsp;exquisitely situated in a deep wooded valley, are the ruins of&nbsp;Rievaulx Abbey, a foundation by Walter LEspec in 1131 for&nbsp;Cistercians. The principal remains are those of the cruciform&nbsp;church, mainly Early English in date, and of the finest workmanship. There are considerable fragments of the refectory, and&nbsp;all the important domestic huildings may be traced. A beautiful&nbsp;prospect over the ruins and the valley is seen from the terrace&nbsp;on the eastern flanking hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIFFIANS, the name given to the Berbers of the Rif district of Morocco, the mountain region bordering the north coast&nbsp;from Ceuta eastward nearly to the horders of Algeria and forming&nbsp;part of the Atlas range. The name, it has been suggested, is&nbsp;identical with Libyan or Libi. A peculiarity of the Rif dialect&nbsp;is the change of the Arabic “ 1 ” to “ r,” and this would seem&nbsp;to support this derivation, “ b ” and “ f ” being interchangeable&nbsp;through “ v.” The Riffians are only nominally subject to the&nbsp;sultan of Morocco, against whose authority they are in constant&nbsp;revolt. They are typical Berbers in physique, tall, well made&nbsp;and muscular, with European features and fair skins bronzed&nbsp;by the sun. In morality they are singularly superior to their&nbsp;neighbours. In order to prevent youthful unchastity, marriages&nbsp;are contracted between children of eight years old, the girl&nbsp;being brought home to live with the lad at his parents’ home&nbsp;till a child is bom, when a separate dwelling is provided for the&nbsp;youthful couple. The women are noted for their beauty.&nbsp;The RifiSans understand and speak Arabic very little. They&nbsp;were among the fiercest and most cruel of the pirates of the&nbsp;north coast of Africa. Even now they are entirely untrustworthy in this respect. See further </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Berbers, Morocco,&nbsp;Moors, Kabyles, Mzabites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIFLE, a firearm which may be shortly defined as a musket in which, by grooves (cf. Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riffeln,</span><span class="font0"> to groove) in the bore&nbsp;or otherwise, the projectile is forced to rotate before leaving&nbsp;the barrel. This rotatory motion, maintained during flight,&nbsp;equalizes any irregularities in the form or weight of the bullet,&nbsp;and so lessens the tendency to depart from a straight line, and&nbsp;also in a measure overcomes atmospheric resistance. Rifling&nbsp;was invented about 1520, by Gaspard Koller or Kollncr, a&nbsp;gunmaker of Vienna, according to some authorities; by August&nbsp;Kotter of Nuremberg, according to others.
