<p><span class="font1">philosophy and theology were antithetical and irreconcilable. Raymond declares that the book of Nature and the Bible are&nbsp;both Divine revelations, the one general and immediate, the&nbsp;other specific and mediate. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Editio Princeps</span><span class="font1"> of the book,&nbsp;which found many imitators, is undated but probably belongs&nbsp;to 1484; there are many subsequent editions, one by J. F. von&nbsp;Seidel as late as 1852. In 1595 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prologus</span><span class="font1"> was put on the&nbsp;Index for its declaration that the Bible is the only source of&nbsp;revealed truth. Montaigne </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Essays,</span><span class="font1"> bk. ii. ch. xii., “ An Apologie&nbsp;of Raymond Sebond ’’) tells how he translated the book into&nbsp;French and found “ the conceits of the author to be excellent,&nbsp;the contexture of his work well followed, and his project full of&nbsp;pietie. . . . His drift is bold, and his scope adventurous, for he&nbsp;undertaketh by humane and naturall reasons, to establish and&nbsp;verifie all the articles of Christian religion against Atheists.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAYMUND, prince of Antioch (1099-1149), was the son of William VI., count of Poitou. On the death of Bohemund II. of&nbsp;Antioch </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.υ),</span><span class="font1"> the principality devolved upon his daughter,&nbsp;Constance, a child of some three years of age (1130). Fulk,&nbsp;the king of Jerusalem, and, as such, guardian of Antioch, was&nbsp;concerned to find a husband for her, and sent envoys to England&nbsp;to offer her hand to Raymund, who was then at the court of&nbsp;Henry I. Raymund accepted the offer, and stealing in disguise&nbsp;through southern Italy, for fear of apprehension by Roger of&nbsp;Sicily, who claimed the inheritance of Antioch as cousin of&nbsp;Bohemund I., he reached Antioch in 1135. Here he was married&nbsp;to Constance by the patriarch, but not until he had done him&nbsp;homage and fealty. The marriage excited the indignation&nbsp;of Alice, the mother of Constance, who had been led by the&nbsp;patriarch to think that it was she whom Raymund desired to&nbsp;wed; and the new prince had thus to face the enmity of the&nbsp;princess dowager and her party. In 1137 he had also to face&nbsp;the advent of the eastern emperor, John Comnenus, who had&nbsp;come south partly to recover Cilicia from Leo, the prince of&nbsp;Armenia, but partly, also, to assert his rights over Antioch.&nbsp;Raymund was forced to do homage, and even to promise to cede&nbsp;his principality as soon as he was recompensed by a new fief,&nbsp;which John promised to carve for him in the Mahommedan&nbsp;territory to the east of Antioch. The expedition of 1138, in&nbsp;which Raymund joined with John, and which was to conquer&nbsp;this territory, naturally proved a failure: Raymund was not&nbsp;anxious to help the emperor to acquire new territories, when&nbsp;their acquisition only meant for him the loss of Antioch; and&nbsp;John had to return unsuccessful to Byzantium, after vainly&nbsp;demanding from Raymund the surrender of the citadel of&nbsp;Antioch. There followed a struggle between Raymund and the&nbsp;patriarch. Raymund was annoyed by the homage which he&nbsp;had been forced to pay to the patriarch in 1135; and the dubious&nbsp;validity of the patriarch’s election offered a handle for opposition.&nbsp;Eventually Raymund triumphed, and the patriarch was deposed&nbsp;(1139). In 1142 John Comnenus returned to the attack; but&nbsp;Raymund refused to recognize or renew his previous submission ;&nbsp;and John, though he ravaged the neighbourhood of Antioch,&nbsp;was unable to effect anything against him. When, however,&nbsp;Raymund demanded from Manuel, who had succeeded John in&nbsp;1143, the cession of some of the Cilician towns, he found that he&nbsp;had met his match. Manuel forced him to a humiliating visit to&nbsp;Constantinople, during which he renewed his oath of homage&nbsp;and promised to receive a Greek patriarch. The last event of&nbsp;importance in Raymund’s life was the visit to Antioch in 1148 of&nbsp;Louis VII. and his wife Eleanor, Raymund’s niece. Raymund&nbsp;sought to prevent Louis from going south to Jerusalem, and to&nbsp;induce him to stay in Antioch and help in the conquest of Aleppo&nbsp;and Caesarea. Perhaps for this end he acquired an influence&nbsp;over his niece, which was by some interpreted as a guilty&nbsp;intimacy. At any rate Louis hastily left Antioch, and Raymund&nbsp;was balked in his plans. In 1149 he fell in battle during&nbsp;an expedition against Nureddin. Raymund is described by&nbsp;William of Tyre (the main authority for his career) as handsome&nbsp;and affable; pre-eminent in the use of arms and military experience; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litteratorum, licet ipse illiteratus esset, cultor</span><span class="font1"> (he caused the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson des chétifs</span><span class="font1"> to be composed); a regular churchman and&nbsp;a faithful husband; but headstrong, irascible and unreasonable,&nbsp;with too great a passion for gambling (bk. xiv. c. xxi.).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAYMUND OF TOULOUSE (sometimes also called Raymund of St Giles, after a town to the south of Nimes), count of Provence,&nbsp;one of the leaders of the first Crusade. According to an Armenian&nbsp;authority, he had lost an eye on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem&nbsp;before the first Crusade; but the statement probably rests on&nbsp;the fact that he was one-eyed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υir monoculus.</span><span class="font1"> He is also recorded to have fought against the Moors in Spain before 1096;&nbsp;and it is certain that he was the first of the princes of the West&nbsp;to take the cross after Pope Urban’s sermon at Clermont. The&nbsp;oldest and the richest of the crusading princes, the count of&nbsp;Provence started, at the end of October 1096, with a large com-pany, which included his wife, his son, and Adhemar, bishop of&nbsp;Puy, the Papal Legate. His march lay by Ragusa and Scutari&nbsp;to Durazzo, whence he struck eastward, along the route also&nbsp;used by Bohemund, to Constantinople. At the end of April&nbsp;1097 he was with difficulty induced to take a somewhat negative&nbsp;oath of fealty to Alexius; for the obstinacy which was one of&nbsp;his characteristics, coupled perhaps with some hope of acquiring&nbsp;new territories, made him reluctant to submit like the other&nbsp;crusaders to Alexius. He was present at Nicaea and Dorylaeum; but he first showed his hand in October 1097, when,&nbsp;as the army neared Antioch, and a rumour was spread that&nbsp;Antioch had been deserted by the Turks, he sent a detachment in&nbsp;advance to occupy the city—an action which presaged his&nbsp;future difficulties with Bohemund, the would-be prince of&nbsp;Antioch. In the siege of Antioch (which was far from having&nbsp;been deserted) Raymund played his part. When the city was&nbsp;taken by Bohemund (June 1098), the count garrisoned the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">palatium Cassiani</span><span class="font1"> (the palace of the emir, Yagi Sian) and the&nbsp;tower over the Bridge Gate. He lay ill during the second siege&nbsp;of Antioch by Kerbogha; but in his camp a great spiritualistic&nbsp;activity culminated in the discovery of the Holy Lance by the&nbsp;Provençals. The miracle stimulated the crusaders to defeat&nbsp;Kerbogha: the Lance itself, discovered by the Provençals and&nbsp;carried henceforward by their count, became a valuable asset in&nbsp;Raymund’s favour; and he began to put difficulties in the way&nbsp;of Bohemund’s retention of Antioch, obstinately alleging the&nbsp;oath to Alexius, and refusing to surrender the positions in the&nbsp;city which he had occupied. A struggle thus arose between the&nbsp;Provençals and the Normans, partly with regard to the genuineness of the Lance, which the Normans naturally doubted, and&nbsp;partly with regard to the possession of Antioch—the real issue&nbsp;at stake. Raymund was the first of the princes to leave Antioch,&nbsp;moving southward in the autumn of 1098 to the siege of Marra,&nbsp;but leaving a detachment of his troops in Antioch. With Bohemund left behind in Antioch; with the possession of the Holy&nbsp;Lance to give him prestige; and with the wealth which he had&nbsp;at his disposal, the count of Provence now definitely began to&nbsp;figure as the leader of the Crusade. If he could have consented&nbsp;to leave Bohemund in possession of Antioch and push southward, he might have achieved much. But he could not stomach&nbsp;the greatness of Bohemund; and when the Normans turned&nbsp;his troops out of Antioch in January 1099, he marched from&nbsp;Marra (which had been captured in December 1098) into the&nbsp;emirate of Tripoli, and began the siege of Arca (February 1099),&nbsp;evidently with the idea of founding a power in Tripoli which&nbsp;would check the expansion of Bohemund’s principality to the&nbsp;south. The siege of Arca was protracted; and the selfish policy&nbsp;of the count, which thus deferred the march to Jerusalem,&nbsp;lost </span><span class="font0">him </span><span class="font1">all support from the mass of the crusaders. A wave of&nbsp;indignation in the ranks, and the inducements which the emir&nbsp;of Tripoli offered to the other princes, forced Raymund to desist&nbsp;from the siege (May 1098), and to march southwards to Jerusa-lem. After the capture of Jerusalem, Raymund was offered,&nbsp;but refused, the advocacy of the Holy Sepulchre. He alleged&nbsp;his reluctance to rule in the city in which Christ had suffered:</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
