<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">persons appointed to positions of trust, such as guardians or receivers. In criminal practice they affect either suspected&nbsp;or accused persons, or witnesses. As early as 1360 the&nbsp;Act of 31 Edw. III. c. 1 empowered justices to take of&nbsp;all them that were not of good fame sufficient surety and&nbsp;mainprize of their good behaviour. The wide terms of&nbsp;this provision are not acted upon at the present day. The&nbsp;only recognizances of this kind practically enforced are&nbsp;those entered into as security for keeping the peace. Such&nbsp;recognizances are forfeited by any act tending to a breach&nbsp;of the peace. The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts of&nbsp;1861 provide that any court may on the conviction of a&nbsp;person for an offence under any of the Acts require him in&nbsp;addition to or in lieu of other punishment to enter into&nbsp;his own recognizances for keeping the peace and being of&nbsp;good behaviour. The power to bind witnesses by recognizance was originally conferred by an Act of 1554, 1 Ph.&nbsp;and M. c. 13. Recognizances are now the usual means&nbsp;by which a court of summary jurisdiction or a coroner&nbsp;binds over a prosecutor and his witnesses or an accused&nbsp;person and his witnesses to appear at the trial. The procedure principally depends upon 7 Geo. IY. c. 64, 11 and&nbsp;12 Viet. c. 42 (one of Jervis’s Acts), 30 and 31 Yict. c. 35&nbsp;(Russell Gurney’s Act), 42 and 43 Yict. c. 49, s. 31 (the&nbsp;Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879). In proceedings in&nbsp;error and in appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction&nbsp;to quarter sessions the prosecution of the appeal by the&nbsp;appellant is secured by recognizance. In certain cases&nbsp;police authorities have by recent statutes a limited authority&nbsp;to take the recognizance of accused persons. Failure to&nbsp;comply with the conditions of recognizances leads to their&nbsp;forfeiture. Additional facilities for the enforcing of recognizances were given by the Summary Jurisdiction Act,&nbsp;1879 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Quarter Sessions). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">When recognizances are&nbsp;forfeited they are </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">estreated</span><span class="font2"> (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">., extracted) from the records&nbsp;of the court to be enforced against the defaulter. An&nbsp;appeal against an order of a court of summary jurisdiction forfeiting recognizances lies to quarter sessions (3 Geo.&nbsp;IY. c. 46). By 28 and 29 Yict. c. 104 a recognizance does&nbsp;not bind the land in the hands of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hona fide</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">purchaser for&nbsp;valuable consideration or a mortgagee unless actual execution has issued and been registered in the name of the&nbsp;debtor at the central office of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Registered recognizances are among the encumbrances for which search is made on a purchase of land.&nbsp;By 45 and 46 Viet. c. 39 an official negative of the existence of registered recognizances may be given by the&nbsp;proper officer on application. A discharge in bankruptcy&nbsp;does not release the debtor from a debt on a recognizance&nbsp;unless the Treasury certify in writing their consent to his&nbsp;discharge (46 and 47 Yict. c. 52, s. 30). Forgery of recognizances is a felony punishable by five years’ penal servitude (24 and 25 Yict. c. 98, s. 32).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Scotland the place of recognizances is filled by cautions; a caution in law-burrows corresponds very nearly&nbsp;to a recognizance to keep the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the United States recognizances are used for much the same purposes as in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Robert </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. 1500-1558), a physician and eminent mathematician, was descended from a respectable&nbsp;family at Tenby in Wales and was born about 1500. He&nbsp;was entered of the university of Oxford about 1525, and&nbsp;was elected fellow of All Souls College in 1531. As he&nbsp;made physic his profession, he went to Cambridge, where&nbsp;he took the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught arithmetic and&nbsp;mathematics, as he had done prior to his going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards went to London,&nbsp;and acted as physician to Edward VI. and to Queen Mary,&nbsp;to whom some of his books are dedicated. He died in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">King’s Bench prison, Southwark, where he was confined for debt, in 1558.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Recorde published several works upon mathematical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, viz. :—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Groundc of Artes, teachinge the Works and Practise of Arith-meticke, both in whole numbers and fractions,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1540, 8vo ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> . . .&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bathe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall,&nbsp;and also for Projection of Plattcs,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1551, 4to ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Castle of&nbsp;Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celcstiall&nbsp;and Material!, kc.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1556, folio ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Whetstone of Witte,&nbsp;which is the second part of Arithmetike, containing the Extraction&nbsp;of Rootes, the Cossike Practice, with the Pules of Equation, and the&nbsp;Woorkes of Surdc Numbers,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1557, 4to. This was the&nbsp;first English book on algebra. He wrote also a medical work,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Urinal of Physic,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1548, frequently reprinted. Sherburne&nbsp;states that Rccorde also published </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cosmographise Isagogc,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that&nbsp;he wrote a book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dc Arte facicndi Horologmm</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and another </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">De Usu&nbsp;Globorum ct de Statu Temponim.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Recorde’s chief contributions&nbsp;to the progress of algebra were in the way of systematizing its&nbsp;notation. He is said to have been the first to use the sign of&nbsp;equality (=) having the two parallel lines, as he says himself, because&nbsp;no two things could be more equal. The adaptation of the rule&nbsp;for extracting the square root of an integral number to the extraction of the square root of an integral algebraical function is also&nbsp;said to be due to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Public. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the definition of the Record Commissioners appointed at the commencement&nbsp;of this century to report upon the nature of the archives,&nbsp;the national muniments of England constitute four great&nbsp;classes. The first class consists of independent documents&nbsp;relating to various subjects, persons, and places, but making&nbsp;altogether one whole, such as, for instance, Domesday Book,&nbsp;or the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII. The second class&nbsp;consists of the series of enrolments, including within one&nbsp;roll great varieties of distinct and separate entries classed&nbsp;according to their formal character, as, for instance, the&nbsp;close rolls and patent rolls, or classed according to their&nbsp;subject-matter, as are the Liberate and the Norman rolls.&nbsp;The third class embraces those records which contain entries&nbsp;of judicial proceedings and those where each subject has a&nbsp;distinct roll; whilst the last class comprises all separate&nbsp;documents, such as letters, inquisitions, privy seals, commissions, and other various descriptions of formal instruments. Sir Edward Coke has given in his signification of&nbsp;the term “ record ” a briefer and less involved definition ;&nbsp;but according to his rendering many important documents&nbsp;would have to be excluded from the list of the national&nbsp;archives. Hence it was decreed, on the passing of the&nbsp;Public Records Act (1 and 2 Viet. c. 94), which created&nbsp;the master of the rolls the keeper of the archives, that&nbsp;the word “records” should be taken to mean “all rolls,&nbsp;records, writs, books, proceedings, decrees, bills, warrants,&nbsp;accounts, papers, and documents whatsoever, of a public&nbsp;nature belonging to Her Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The documents of the once styled Courts of Chancery, Queen’s Bench, Exchequer, and Common Pleas contain&nbsp;the very essence of England’s antiquarian wealth : they&nbsp;constitute most of its bulk, much of its legal importance,&nbsp;and nearly all its historical interest. “ The custom of&nbsp;recording documents on rolls of parchment,” writes Sir&nbsp;Thomas Hardy, the late deputy-keeper of the public records,&nbsp;“ though of very ancient date, commenced nevertheless at&nbsp;a period subsequent to the Conquest; for no vestige can&nbsp;be traced of such a system during the Anglo-Saxon dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Apud Anglo-Saxones/ says Hickes, ‘ etiam mos erat leges regum latas in codicibus monasteriorum tanquam in tabulas&nbsp;publicas referendi.’ It may be assumed that, had such a&nbsp;})Ian been then in operation, the same would have been&nbsp;adopted by the Conqueror to perpetuate the survey of the&nbsp;kingdom which he caused to be made, and for the preservation of which he evinced so much zeal and anxiety.” As&nbsp;to the precise time when the use of rolls for the entry of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
