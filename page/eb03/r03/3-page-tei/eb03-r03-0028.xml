From the ſpecimen of his talents for mufic here given, we make no ſcruple of declaring, that he had a truer genius for this ſcience, in point of melody, than any of his predeceſſors or cotemporaries : there is alſo a ſtrength of expreſſion in his verſes, which ſets him far above the middle rank as a poet. Like moſt other aitiſts of real original merit, he complains of the ill uſage of the world, and the difficulty he finds in procuring a bare fubſiſtence.</p><p>ROSACEA.

She had been educated, according to the cuſtom of the times, in the nunnery of Godſtow ; and the popular ſtory of her is as follows: Henry II. ſaw her, loved her, declared his paſſion, and triumphed over her honour. To avoid the jealouſy of his queen Elinor, he kept her in a wonderful labyrinth at Wood-ſtock, and by his connection with her had William Longſword earl of Saliſhury, and Geoffrey biſhop of Lincoln. O,n Henry’s abſence in France, however, on account of a rebellion in that country, the queen found mea∏6 to diſcover her, and though ſtruck with her beauty, ſhe recalled ſufficient reſentment to poiſon her. The queen, it is ſaid, diſeovered her apartment by a thread of ſilk ; but how ſhe came by it is differently related. This popular ſtory is not however ſupported by hiſtory ; ſeveral writers mention no more of her, than that the queen ſo vented her ſpleen on Roſamond as that the lady lived not long after. Other writers aſſert that ſhe died a natural death; and the ſtory of her being poiſoned is thought to have ariſen from the figure of a cup on her tomb. She was buried in the church of Godſtow, oppoſite to the high altar, where her body remained till it was ordered to be removed with every mark ol diſgrace by Hugh biſhop of Lincoln, in 1191. She was, however, by many conſidered as a faint after her death, as appears from an inſcription on a crois wſhich Leland ſays ſtood near Godſtow :</p><p><hi rend="italic">Slut meat hac oret, ſignumſalutis adοret,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Utque Jlbi detur veniam.

Soon after her death this wonderful metamorphoiis happened, and the ſtone was . ſhown to ſtrangers at Godſtow till the time of the diſſo-lution.</p><p>ROSARY, among the Roman Catholics.

Its length is 3 £ miles, its breadth 28. The air of the county, both on the plains and mountains, is healthy ; the foil yields plenty of graſs with ſome corn, and feeds numerous herds of cattle. The Curlew mountains on the north are very high and ſteep ; and, till a road with great labour and difficulty was cut through them, were im-paffable.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Roscommon, which gives the tide of earl to the family of Dillon, and name to the county, though not large, is both a parliamentary borough and the county town.</hi></p><p>ROSCOMMON (Wentworth Dillon, earl of), a celebrated poet of the 17th century, was the ſon of James Dillon earl of Roſcommon ; and was born in Ireland, under the adminiſtration of the firſt earl of Strafford, who was his uncle, and from whom he received the name of <hi rend="italic">Wentworth</hi>  at his baptiſm. He paffed his infancy in Ireland ; after which the earl of Strafford ſent for him into England, and placed him at his own ſeat in Yorkſhire, under the tuition of Dr Hall, afterwards biſhop of Norwich, who inſtructed him in Latin, without teaching him the common rules of grammar, which he could never retain in his memory, and yet he learnt to write in that language with claffical elegance and propriety. On the earl of Strafford’s being impeached, he went to complete his education at Caen in Normandy ; and after ſome years travelled to Rome, where he became acquainted with the moſt valuable remains of antiquity, and in particular was well ſkilled in medals, and learned to ſpeak Italian with ſuch grace and fluency, that he was frequently taken for a native. He returned to England ſoon after the Relloration, and was made captain of the band of penſioners ; but a diſ-pute with the lord privy-ſeal, about a part of his eſtate, obliged him to reſign his poſt, and reviſit his native country, where the duke of Ormond appointed him captain oſ the guards. He was unhappily very fond of gaming ; and as he was returning to his lodgings from a gaming-table in Dublin, he was attacked in the dark by three ruffians, who were employed to aſſaſſinate him.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
