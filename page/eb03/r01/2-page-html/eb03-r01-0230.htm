<p><span class="font4">REYN (Jan de), an eminent hiſtory and portrait painter, born at Dunkirk in 1610. He had the good&nbsp;fortune to be a diſciple of Vandyke, was the ſirſt performer, in his ſohool, and was ſo attached to his mailer that he followed him to London, where it is&nbsp;thought he continued as long as he lived. In fheſe&nbsp;^kingdoms he is moſtly known by the name of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lang&nbsp;Jan.</span><span class="font4"> He died in 1678 : and it is imagined that the&nbsp;ſcarcity of his works is occaſioned by ſo many of them&nbsp;being imputed to Vandyke ; a circumſtance which,&nbsp;.if true, is beyond any tiling that could be ſaid in his&nbsp;•praiſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REYNOLDS (Sir Joſhua), the celebrated painter, was, on July the 16th 1723, bom at Plympton, a&nbsp;fmall town in Devonſhire. His father was miniſter of&nbsp;the pariſh, and alſo maſter of the grammar ſchool ; and&nbsp;being a man of learning and philanthropy, he was be-ſoved and reſpected by all to whom he was known.—&nbsp;Such a man, it will naturally be ſuppofed, was affiduous in the cultivation of the minds of his children,&nbsp;among whom his ſon Joſhua ſhonc conſpicuous, by displaying at a very early period a ſuperiority of genius,&nbsp;and the rudiments of a correct taſte. Unlike other&nbsp;boys, who generally content themſelves with giving a&nbsp;literal explanation of their author, regardleſs of his&nbsp;beauties or his faults, young Reynolds attended to both&nbsp;theſe, difplaying a happy knowledge of what he read^&nbsp;and entering with ardour into the ſpirit of his author.&nbsp;He diſcovered likewiſe talents for compoſition, and a&nbsp;natural propenſity to drawing, in which his friends and&nbsp;intimates thought him qualified to excel. Emulation&nbsp;was a diſtinguiſhing feature in his mind, wliich his father perceived with the delight natural to a parent ;&nbsp;and deſigning him for the church, in which he hoped&nbsp;that his talents might raife him to eminence, he ſent&nbsp;him to one of the univerſities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soon after this period he grew paffionately fond of painting ; and, by the peruſal of Richardſon’s theory&nbsp;of that art, was determined to make it his profeffion&nbsp;through life. At his own earneſt requeſt, therefore, he&nbsp;was removed to London ; and about the year 1742 be-came a pupil to Mr Hudſon, who, though not himſelf&nbsp;an eminent painter was preceptor to ſeverals who afterwards excelled in the art. One of the ſirſt advices&nbsp;which he gave to Mr Reynolds was to copy carefully&nbsp;Guercino’s drawings. This was done with ſuch ſkill,</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">that many of the copies are ſaid to be now preſerved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that&nbsp;very great maſter.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">About the year 174.9, Mr IReynolds went to Italy -under the auſpices, and in the company, of the late&nbsp;JLord (then Commodore) Keppel, who was appointed&nbsp;to the command of the .Britiſh ſquadron in the Medi-terranean. in this garden of the world, this magic&nbsp;feat of the arts, he failed not to viſit the fchools of the&nbsp;great maſters, to ſtudy the productions of different&nbsp;ages, and to contemplate with unwearied attention the&nbsp;various beauties which are characteriſtic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ei</span><span class="font4"> each. His&nbsp;labour here, as has been obſerved of another painter,&nbsp;was &quot; the labour of love, not the taſk of the hireling&nbsp;and how much he profited by it is .known to all Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having remained about two years in Italy, and </span><span class="font2">ſta-</span><span class="font4">died the language as well as the arts of the country with great ſucceſs, he returned to England, improved&nbsp;by travel and refined bÿ education. On the road to&nbsp;London from the port where he landed, he accidentally&nbsp;found in the inn where he lodged Johnſon’s life oſ Sa-vage ; and was ſo taken with the charms of compoſi-tion, and the maſterly delineation of character diſplay--ed in that performance, that, having begun tp read&nbsp;it while leaning with his arm on the chimney-piece, he&nbsp;continued in that attitude inſenſible of pain till he was&nbsp;hardly able to raiſe his hand to his head. The admiration of the work naturaliy led him to ſeek the acquaintance of its author·, who continued one of his ſincereſt&nbsp;admirers and warmeſt friends, till 1784, when they&nbsp;were ſeparated by the ſtroke of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The firſt thing that diſtinguiſhed him aſter his return to his native country, was a full length portrait of&nbsp;Commodore Keppel ; which in the polite circles was&nbsp;ſpoken of in terms of the higheſt encomium, and tef-tified to what a degree of eminence he had arrived in&nbsp;his profeffion. This was followed by a portrait of&nbsp;Lord Edgecombe, and a few others, which at once&nbsp;introduced him to the firſt buſineſs in portrait painting »&nbsp;and that branch of the art he cultivated with ſuch ſuccefs as will for ever eſtabliſh his fame with all deſcrip-tions of reſined ſociety. Having painted ſome of the&nbsp;ſirſt-rate beauties of the age, the polite world flocked&nbsp;to ſee the graces and the charms of his pencil ; and he&nbsp;ſoon became the moſt faſhionable painter, not only ſu&nbsp;England, but in all Europe. He has indeed preſerved&nbsp;the refemblance of ſo many illuſtrious characters, that we&nbsp;feel the leſs regret for his having left behind him ſo ſc<sub>w&nbsp;</sub>hiſtorical paintings ; though what he has done in that&nbsp;way ſhows @@(a) him to have been qualified to excel in&nbsp;both departments. The only landſcape, perhaps, which</span></p><div>
