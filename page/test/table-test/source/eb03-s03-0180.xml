            <p>foreſide oſ the after bits be the aft part of the foremoſt magazine, drawing the
                bulkhead thereof, which will come to the aft side of the sixth beam ; therefore,
                from the sixth beam to the foremoſt end of the orlop, the plank and beams will be
                repreſented juſt in the ſame manner as before mentioned for the after part of the
                orlop : then the midſhip part of the deck will be repreſented by letting the upper
                line be the upper side of the plank, and likewiſe the upper side of the beams ; and
                the lower line will repreſent the lower edge of the plank, only drawing it from beam
                to beam, and obſerving not to let it paſs through them.</p>
            <p>The hatchways, &amp;c. may now be repreſented on the orlop, letting the main, fore,
                and after hatchway, be exactly under thoſe of the gun-deck : there muſt be one over
                the fiſh room, and one over the spirit room. There muſt be two ſcuttles over the
                after magazine for the passage to the magazine and light room. There ſhould alſo be
                one afore the fourth beam from forward for the passage to the fore magazine, and one
                abaft the ſecond beam for the paſſage to the light room.</p>
            <p>The bulkheads for the fore and after parts of the well may be drawn from the lower
                deck beams to the orlop, and from thence to the limber ſtrake in the hold. The ſhot
                lockers may alſo be repreſented, having one afore and one abaft the well : there
                ſhould alſo be one abaft the foremoſt magazine, the ends of which may be formed by
                the after bits. The ſteps of the masts may be drawn in by continuing their centres
                down to the limber ſtrake ; and likewiſe two crutches abaft the mizen ſtep divided
                equally between that and the after part of the cutting down : the breaſt hooks may
                alſo be drawn letting them be five in number below the lower deck hook, and all
                equally divided between that and the fore ſtep. Hence every part of the inboard is
                decribed as far as neceſtary.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of the Method of
                    Whole-moulding.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Having</hi> now finiſhed the methods of laying down the ſeveral
                plans of a ſhip, any farther addition on this ſubject might appear unnecessary. We
                cannot, however, with propriety, omit to deſcribe the method called <hi
                    rend="italic">whole-moulding,</hi> uſed by the ancients, and which still
                continues in uſe among thoſe unacquainted with the more proper methods already
                explained. This method will be illuſtrated by laying down the ſeveral plans of a
                longboat; the length of the keel being 29 feet, and breadth moulded nine ſeet.</p>
            <p>Draw the ſtraight line PO (fig. 37.) equal to 29 feet, the extreme length oſ the
                boat, and alſo to repreſent the upper edge of the keel. Let ⊕ be the ſtation of the
                midſhip frame. From the points P, ⊕, and O, draw the lines PT, ⊕M, and OS,
                perpendicular to PO. Make ⊕M, ⊕N, equal to the upper and lower heights of breadth
                reſpectively at the main frame, PT the height of breadth at the tranſom, and OS the
                height at the ſtem. Deſcribe the curve TMS to repreſent the ſheer or extreme height
                of the side, which in a ſhip would be called the <hi rend="italic">upper height oſ
                    breadth line,</hi> or upper edge of the wale. Through the point N draw a curve
                parallel to TMS, to repreſent the breadth of the upper ſtrake of a boat, or lower
                edge of the wale if in</p>
            <p>a ſhip. The dotted line TNS may alſo be drawn to repreſent the lower height of
                breadth.</p>
            <p>Set off the rake of the port from P to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and draw the line
                    <hi rend="italic">p t</hi> to repreſent the aft side of the port ; then T <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> will repreſent the round up of the tranſom. Set off the
                breadth of the port from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to r, and from T to s, and draw
                the line <hi rend="italic">r</hi> s to repreſent the foreside of the port, which may
                either be a curve or a ſtraight line at pleaſure. Set up the height of the tuck from
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to <hi rend="italic">k. </hi>Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> X be the thickneſs of the tranſom, and draw the line ZX to repreſent the
                foreside of the tranſom.</p>
            <p>There is given the point S, the height of the ſheer on the foreside of the ſtem ; now
                that side of the ſtem is to be formed either by ſweeps or some other contrivance.
                Set off the breadth of the ſtem, and form the aft side of it.</p>
            <p>Set up the dead-rising from ⊕ to d, and form the rising line r i s. Draw the line KL
                parallel to PO to repreſent the lower edge of the keel, and another to repreſent the
                thickneſs of the plank or the rabbet. The rabbet on the poſt and ſtem may also be
                repreſented ; and the ſtations of the timbers aſſigned, as⊗, ( 1 ), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                6, 7, 9 ; and ⊕, (A), A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ; and the ſheer plan will be completed.</p>
            <p>The half-breadth plan is to be formed next ; for this purpoſe the perpendiculars TP,
                9, 8, &amp;c. muſt be produced. Upon M⊕ produced ſet off the half breadth from the
                line KL to R (fig. 38.) ; ſet off alſo the half breadth at the tranſom from K to <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> and deſcribe the extreme half breadth line <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> RX, making the forepart of the curve agreeable to the
                propoſed round of the tranſom.</p>
            <p>We may next proceed to form the timbers in the body plan. Let AB (fig. 39.) be the
                breadth moulded at ⊕. Erect the perpendicular CD in the middle of the line AB ; draw
                the line <hi rend="italic">m n</hi> diſtant therefrom the half thickneſs of the
                poſt, and <hi rend="italic">x y</hi> the half thickneſs of the ſtern. Then take off
                the ſeveral portions of the perpendiculars®, 1, 2, &amp;c. intercepted between the
                upper edge of the keel and the rising line in the ſheer plan, and ſet them up from C
                upon the line CD ; through theſe points draw lines parallel to AC ; take off alſo
                the ſeveral lower heights of breadth at⊗ , 1, 2, &amp;c. from the sheer plan ; and
                ſet them up from C upon the middle line in the body plan; and draw lines parallel to
                AC through theſe points : Then take off the ſeveral half breadths correſponding to
                each from the floor plan ; and ſet them off on their proper half-breadth lines from
                the middle line in the body plan.</p>
            <p>Conſtruct the midſhip frame by Problem V. the form of which will in ſome meaſure
                determine the form of the rest. For if a mould be made on any side of the middle
                line to fit the curve part of it, and the rising line, or that marked <hi
                    rend="italic">bend mould</hi> (fig. 40.), and laid in ſuch a manner that the
                lower part it, which is ſtraight, may be ſet upon the ſeveral rising lines, and the
                upper part juſt touch the point of the half breadth in the breadth line
                correſponding to that rifing upon which the mould is placed, a curve may then be
                drawn by the mould to the rising line. In this manner we may proceed ſo far as the
                rising line is parallel to the lower height oſ the breadth line. Then a hollow mould
                muſt be made, the upper end of which is left ſtraight, as</p>
