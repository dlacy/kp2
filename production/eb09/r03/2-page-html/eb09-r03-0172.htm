<p><span class="font0">broad or roundish in outline, with a very short stalk or none at all, and of all hues except blue. The very numerous stamens&nbsp;originate from about the same spot as the sepals and petals ; each&nbsp;has a slender filament and a small two-celled anther. The inner&nbsp;portion of the receptacular tube whence the stamens spring is thick&nbsp;and fleshy, and is occasionally spoken of as the “disk” ; but, as&nbsp;in this case it does not represent any separate organ, it is better to&nbsp;avoid the use of the term. The carpels are very numerous, ultimately hard in texture, covered with hairs, and each provided with&nbsp;a long style and button-like stigma. The carpels are concealed&nbsp;within the receptacular tube and only the stigmas as a rule protrude from its mouth. Each carpel contains one ovule without&nbsp;perisperm. The so-called fruit is merely the receptacular tube,&nbsp;which, as previously mentioned, becomes fleshy and brightly&nbsp;coloured as an attraction to birds, which devour the hips and thus&nbsp;secure the dispersion of the seed. The stamens are in whorls, and,&nbsp;according to Payer, they originate in pairs one on each side of the&nbsp;base of each petal (parapetalous), so that there are ten in each row ;&nbsp;a second row of ten alternates with the first, a third with the&nbsp;second, and so on. By repeated radial and tangential branching a&nbsp;vast number of stamens are ultimately produced, and when these&nbsp;stamens assume a petaloid aspect we have as a consequence the&nbsp;double flowers which are so much admired. The carpels are much&nbsp;less subject to this petaloid change, and, as it generally happens in&nbsp;the most double of roses that some few at least of the anthers are&nbsp;formed with pollen, the production of seed and the possibility of&nbsp;cross-breeding become intelligible. Under natural circumstances&nbsp;rose flowers do not secrete honey, the attraction for insects being&nbsp;provided, according to Müller, by the colour and perfume and the&nbsp;abundance of pollen for food. The stigmas and anthers come to&nbsp;maturity at the same time, and thus, while cross-fertilization by&nbsp;insect agency is doubtless most common, close fertilization is not&nbsp;prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Student's Flora</span><span class="font0"> Sir Joseph Hooker recognizes seven species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rosa</span><span class="font0"> as British. Among them may be mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">B&nbsp;SqAnosissima,</span><span class="font0"> the Scotch Rose, much less variable than the others,&nbsp;A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rubigiηosa,</span><span class="font0"> the Sweet Brier, represented by several varieties, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R.&nbsp;canina,</span><span class="font0"> the DogRose, of which no fewer than twenty-nine varieties&nbsp;are described, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. arvensis.</span><span class="font0"> Cultivated roses are frequently&nbsp;“budded” or worked upon the stems of the brier or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. canina,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;upon young seedling plants of the same species. Other species also&nbsp;are used for stocks (see Horticulture). Roses have been grown&nbsp;for so many centuries and have been crossed and recrossed so often&nbsp;that it is difficult to refer the cultivated forms to their wild prototypes. The older roses doubtless originated from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. galliea,</span><span class="font0"> a&nbsp;native of central and southern Europe. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. Centifolia</span><span class="font0"> (the Cabbage&nbsp;Rose), a native of the Caucasus, contributed its share. A cross&nbsp;between the two species named may have been the source whence&nbsp;originated the Bourbon Roses. The yellow-flowered Austrian and&nbsp;Persian Brier originated from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. Cglanteria,</span><span class="font0"> a native of Austria.&nbsp;The Monthly or China Roses sprang from the Chinese </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. iηdicα,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and these crossed with others of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. Centifolia οτ galliea</span><span class="font0"> type are&nbsp;the source of the hybrid perpétuais so commonly grown nowadays,&nbsp;because, in addition to their other attractions, their blooming season&nbsp;is relatively prolonged, and, moreover, is repeated in the autumn.&nbsp;Tea Roses and Noisettes, it is to be presumed, also acknowledge&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rosa indiea</span><span class="font0"> as one of their progenitors. The Banksian Rose is a&nbsp;Chinese Climbingspecies, with small white or fawn-coloured flowers&nbsp;of great beauty ; the Macartney Rose (A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bracteata)</span><span class="font0"> is also of Chinese&nbsp;origin. Its nearly evergreen deep green leaves and large white&nbsp;flowers are very striking. The Japanese A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rugosa</span><span class="font0"> is also a remarkable species, notable for its bold rugose foliage, its large white or&nbsp;pink flowers, and its conspicuous globular fruit. A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">damascena</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;cultivated in some parts of Roumelia for the purpose of making&nbsp;attar of roses (see Oils and Perfumery). According to Hanbury,&nbsp;the flowers are gathered before sunrise and distilled the same day.&nbsp;The distilled liquid is allowed to remain for a day or two, by which&nbsp;time most of the oil will have risen to the surface, from which it&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> is skimmed off. The percentage yielded is very small, not more&nbsp;than O<sup>-</sup>O 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In India A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">damascena</span><span class="font0"> is grown largely near Ghazipur for the purpose of procuring attar of roses and rose water. The roses&nbsp;are distilled with double their weight of water. The attar is&nbsp;skimmed off in the Turkish method. Colonel Drury mentions that&nbsp;it takes 200,000 roses to yield the weight of a rupee in attar. This&nbsp;quantity sells on the spot for 100 rupees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rose water is chiefly produced in Europe from the Provence or cabbage rose, A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Centifolia,</span><span class="font0"> grown for the purpose at Mitcham and&nbsp;much more abundantly in the south of France. Conserve of roses&nbsp;and infusion of roses, two medicinal preparations retained for their&nbsp;agreeable qualities rather than for any special virtue, are prepared&nbsp;from the petals of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rosa galliea,</span><span class="font0"> one variety of which was formerly&nbsp;grown for the purpose near the town of Provins. Conserve of dog&nbsp;rose is made from the ripe hips of the dog rose, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rosa canina.</span><span class="font0"> Its&nbsp;only use is in the manufacture of pills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name Rose of Jericho is popularly applied to a small Cruciferous weed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anastatiea Iiierochuntina,</span><span class="font0"> a native of the desert</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">regions of Egypt, !Arabia, Palestine, and Persia. In the dry season the dead branches are strongly incurved, and thus serve to&nbsp;protect the still living seed in the pods. In the wet season the&nbsp;branches absorb the moisture to a large extent, unfold, resume the&nbsp;direction they had in life, and facilitate the dispersion of the seed&nbsp;under circumstances favourable to germination. The plant is&nbsp;frequently carried off as a curiosity, inasmuch as immersion in a&nbsp;basin of water enables it to resume the original form and to create&nbsp;the impression that the plant “comes to life again,” but the process is purely a physical one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSELLINI, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ippolito</span><span class="font1"> (1800-1843), a native of Pisa and subsequently professor there of Oriental languages, in&nbsp;which Mezzofanti was his teacher, is best known as the&nbsp;associate of J. F. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Champollion</span><span class="font1"> (y.u), whose studies he&nbsp;shared and whom he accompanied in his Egyptian&nbsp;explorations (1828). On the death of Champollion the&nbsp;publication of the results of their expedition fell to&nbsp;Rosellini </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Monumenti delV Egitto e della Rubia,</span><span class="font1"> Florence,&nbsp;1832-1840, 10 vols. fol.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSEMARY </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rosmarinus),</span><span class="font1"> a well-known Labiate plant, the only representative of the genus and a native of the&nbsp;Mediterranean region. It is a low shrub with linear&nbsp;leaves, dark green above, white beneath, and with margins&nbsp;rolled back on to the under surface. The flowers are in&nbsp;small axillary clusters. Each has a two-lipped calyx,&nbsp;from which projects a bluish two-lipped corolla enclosing&nbsp;two stamens, the other two being deficient. The fruit consists of four smooth nutlets. Botanically the genus is near&nbsp;to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Salvia,</span><span class="font1"> but it differs in the shorter connective to the&nbsp;anther. Rosemary was highly esteemed by the ancients&nbsp;for its aromatic fragrance and medicinal uses. In modern&nbsp;times it is valued mainly as a perfume, for which purpose&nbsp;the oil is obtained by distillation. It doubtless has slight&nbsp;stimulant properties, which may account for the general&nbsp;belief in the efficacy of the plant in promoting the growth&nbsp;of the hair. Rosemary plays no unimportant part in&nbsp;literature and folk-lore, being esteemed as an emblem of&nbsp;remembrance. “ There ’s rosemary, that <sup>,</sup>s for remembrance,” says Ophelia. Its use in connexion with funeral&nbsp;ceremonies is not extinct in country places to this day,&nbsp;and it was formerly as much valued at wedding festivities.&nbsp;The name “ ros marinus ” or “ ros maris ” was probably&nbsp;given in allusion to its native habitat in the neighbourhood of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSETTA (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt,</span><span class="font1"> vol. vii. p. 768). The celebrated Rosetta Stone, a basalt stele containing a decree of Ptolemy V. Epiphanes in hieroglyphics, demotic, and&nbsp;Greek, which supplied the key for the decipherment of&nbsp;the ancient monuments of Egypt, was found near Fort St&nbsp;Julien, 4 miles north of the town, in 1799, by Boussard, a&nbsp;French officer. It is now in the British Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSEWOOD. Under this name several distinct kinds of ornamental timber are more or less known. That,&nbsp;however, so called in the United Kingdom is Brazilian&nbsp;rosewood, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">palissandre</span><span class="font1"> of the French, the finest qualities of which, coming from the provinces of Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;and Bahia, are believed to be the produce principally of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dalbergia nigra,</span><span class="font1"> a Leguminous tree of large dimensions,&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cabiuna</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jacaranda</span><span class="font1"> by the Brazilians. The&nbsp;same name, jacaranda, is applied to several species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Machxrvum,</span><span class="font1"> also trees belonging to the natural order </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legti-minosæ</span><span class="font1"> ; and there can be no doubt that a certain proportion of the rosewood of commerce is drawn from these&nbsp;sources. Formerly Brazilian rosewood was said, on the&nbsp;authority of the French botanist and traveller Guillemin,&nbsp;to be the produce of a species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Triptolomæa,</span><span class="font1"> but that&nbsp;genus has now been constituted a section of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dalbergia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Rosewood comes to the United Kingdom from Rio, Bahia,&nbsp;Jamaica, and Honduras.
