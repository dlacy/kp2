<p><span class="font1">presence of radium in a body which contains only 10<sup>-11</sup> gram of radium. With care, 10<sup>-12</sup> gram can just be detected. This&nbsp;emanation method has been employed with great success in&nbsp;measuring the quantity of radium in minerals and in rocks. A&nbsp;very simple method has been devised of determining the quantity&nbsp;of radium present when it is not less than 1∕100 milligram. The&nbsp;tube containing the radium is placed some distance from an&nbsp;electroscope which is surrounded by a lead screen about 3 mms.&nbsp;thick. This cuts off the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays and the effect in the&nbsp;electroscope is then due to the penetrating 7 rays. By comparison of the rate of discharge with that of a standard preparation of radium at the same distance, the quantity of radium can&nbsp;at once be deduced, provided the radium is in equilibrium with&nbsp;its emanation. This is usually the case if the radium preparation&nbsp;is one month old. This method is simple and direct, and has&nbsp;the great advantage that the radium tube under test need not&nbsp;be opened, nor its contents weighed. We shall sec later that the&nbsp;amount of radium in an old mineral is always proportional to the&nbsp;amount of uranium present. Rutherford and Boltwood (8)&nbsp;found that 3‧4 parts of radium by weight arc present in ten&nbsp;million parts of uranium. Consequently an old mineral containing 1000 kilos of uranium should contain 340 milligrams of&nbsp;pure radium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to radium and polonium, a number of other radioactive substances have been found in uranium minerals.&nbsp;With the exception of the radium emanation, none of these have&nbsp;yet been isolated in a pure state, although preparations of some&nbsp;of them have been obtained comparable in activity with radium&nbsp;itself. Debierne (9) found a radioactive substance which was&nbsp;separated from pitchblende with the rare earths and had chemical&nbsp;properties similar to those of thorium. This he called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actinium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Giesel (10) independently noted the presence of a new radio-active substance which was usually separated with lanthanum&nbsp;and cerium from the minerals. It possessed the property of&nbsp;giving out a radioactive emanation or gas, the activity of which&nbsp;died away in a few seconds. For this reason he called it the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emanating substance</span><span class="font1"> and afterwards </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emanium.</span><span class="font1"> Later work has&nbsp;shown that emanium is identical in chemical and radioactive&nbsp;properities with actinium, so that the former name will be&nbsp;retained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have already seen that Mme Curie gave the name polonium to a radioactive substance separated with bismuth. Later&nbsp;Marckwald found that a very radioactive substance was deposited from a solution of a radioactive mineral on a polished&nbsp;bismuth plate. The active matter was found to be deposited&nbsp;in the bismuth with tellurium, and he gave the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">radio-tellurium</span><span class="font1"> to this substance. In later work, he showed that the&nbsp;new substance could be chemically separated from tellurium.&nbsp;By treating the residues from 15 tons of Joachimsthal pitch-blende, Marckwald (11) finally obtained 3 milligrams of intensely&nbsp;active material—far more active weight for weight than radium.&nbsp;It has been definitely settled that the active substance of&nbsp;Marckwald is identical with polonium. Both substances give&nbsp;out a type of easily absorbed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> rays and both lose their activity&nbsp;at the same rate. The activity of polonium decays in a geo-metrical progression with the time and falls to half its initial&nbsp;value in 140 days. This law of decay, as we shall see, is characteristic of all radioactive products, although the period of&nbsp;decay is different in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mme Curie and Debierne (12) have described further experiments with polonium. The latter substance was extracted from several tons of pitchblende and purified until 2 milligrams&nbsp;of material were obtained containing about 1/10 milligram of&nbsp;pure polonium. From a knowledge of the relative periods of&nbsp;transformation of radium and polonium, it can be calculated&nbsp;that the amount of polonium in a radium mineral is 1/5000 of&nbsp;the amount of radium, while the activity of pure polonium&nbsp;measured by the α rays should be 5000 times greater than that&nbsp;of radium. As we have seen, polonium is rapidly transformed,&nbsp;and it is of great interest to determine the nature of the substance&nbsp;into which polonium changes. We shall see later that there is&nbsp;considerable evidence that polonium changes into lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently Boltwood (13) has separated another substance from uranium minerals which he has called “ ionium. ” This&nbsp;substance is sometimes separated from the mineral with actinium&nbsp;and has chemical properties very similar to those of thorium.&nbsp;Preparations of ionium have been obtained several thousand&nbsp;times as active as uranium. Ionium emits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1"> rays of short&nbsp;range and has a period of transformation probably much longer&nbsp;than that of radium. Ionium has a special interest inasmuch&nbsp;as it is the substance which changes directly into radium. A&nbsp;preparation of ionium initially free from radium grows radium&nbsp;at a rapid rate. Hofmann found that the lead separated from&nbsp;uranium minerals and named it radiolead. The active con-stituent in the lead is radium D, which changes into radium E&nbsp;and then into radium F (polonium). Both radium D and&nbsp;radium F arc products of the transformation of radium. In&nbsp;addition to these radioactive substances mentioned above,&nbsp;a large number of other radioactive substances have been&nbsp;discovered. Most of these lose their activity in the course of a&nbsp;few hours or days. The properties of these substances and their&nbsp;position in the radioactive series will be discussed later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Radiations from Radioactive Substances. —</span><span class="font1">All the radioactive substances possess in common the property of emitting radiations which darken a photographic plate and cause a discharge&nbsp;of electrified bodies. Very active preparations of radium,&nbsp;actinium and polonium also possess the property of causing&nbsp;strong phosphorescence in some substances. Bodies which&nbsp;phosphoresce under X rays usually do so under the rays from&nbsp;radioactive matter. Barium platinocyanide, the mineral&nbsp;willemite (zinc silicate) and zinc sulphide are the best known&nbsp;examples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are in general three types of radiation emitted by the radioactive bodies, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> and 7 rays. Ruther-ford (2) in 1899 showed that the radiation from uranium was&nbsp;complex and consisted of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> an easily absorbed radiation stopped&nbsp;by a sheet of paper or a few centimetres of air which he called&nbsp;the a rays and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font1"> a far more penetrating radiation capable of&nbsp;passing through several millimetres of aluminium, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">rays. Later Villard found that radium emitted a very pene-trating kind of radiation called the γ rays capable of passing&nbsp;before absorption through twenty centimetres of iron and&nbsp;several centimetres of lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Giesel and, later, Curie and Becquerel showed that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays of radium were deflected by a magnetic field. By the work of&nbsp;Becquerel and Kaufmann the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays have been shown to consist&nbsp;of negatively charged particles projected with a velocity ap-proaching that of light, and having the same small mass as the&nbsp;electrons set free in a vacuum tube. In fact the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays are&nbsp;electrons spontaneously ejected from the radioactive matter at&nbsp;a speed on an average much greater than that observed in the&nbsp;electrons set free in a vacuum tube.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The very penetrating γ rays are not deflected in a magnetic or electric field and are believed to be a type of radiation&nbsp;similar to X rays. The γ rays are only observed in radioactive&nbsp;substances which emit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays, and the penetrating power of&nbsp;the 7 rays appears to be connected with the initial velocity of&nbsp;expulsion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays. Two general theories have been&nbsp;advanced to account for the properties of these rays. On one&nbsp;view, the γ rays are to be regarded as electromagnetic pulses&nbsp;which have their origin in the expulsion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> particle from&nbsp;the atom. On the other hand Bragg has collected evidence&nbsp;in support of the view that the γ rays arc corpuscular and con-sist of uncharged particles or “ neutral doublets. ” There is as&nbsp;yet no general consensus of opinion as to the true nature of the&nbsp;γ rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rutherford (14) showed in 1903 that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1"> rays were deflected in a powerful magnetic or electric field. The amount of deflection&nbsp;is very small compared with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays under similar conditions. The direction of deflection in a magnetic field is&nbsp;opposite to that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays, showing that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1"> rays consist&nbsp;of a stream of positively charged particles. A pencil of rays&nbsp;from a thick layer of radioactive matter is complex and con-sists of particles moving at varying velocities If, however,</span></p>
