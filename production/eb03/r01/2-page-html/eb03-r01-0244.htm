<p><span class="font0">to folds, and theſe folds again wrinkled. The body was bulky and round, and from the ſhoulder ran a line,&nbsp;or fold, as in the ſingle-horned rhinoceros, though it&nbsp;was but faintly marked. There were ſeveral other folds&nbsp;and wrinkles on the body and legs ; and the whole gave&nbsp;rather the appearance of ſoftneſs : the legs were thick,&nbsp;ſhort, and remarkably ſtrong· ; the feet armed with three&nbsp;diſtinct hoofs, of a blackiſh colour, which ſurrounded&nbsp;half the foot, one in front, the others on each ſide.—&nbsp;The ſoles of the feet were convex, of a light colour,&nbsp;and the cuticle on them not thicker than that on the&nbsp;foot of a man who is uſed to walking ; the teſticles&nbsp;Hardly appeared externally ; the penis was bent backward, and opened about 18 inches below the anus. At&nbsp;its origin it was as thick as a man’s leg, and about two&nbsp;feet and a half long ; the bend in it occaſions the urine&nbsp;to be diſcharged backwards. The glans is very ſingular ; the opening of the urethra is like the mouth of a&nbsp;cup with its brim bending over a little and is about&nbsp;three quarters of an inch in diameter ; the glans here is&nbsp;about half an inch in diameter, and continues that thick-neſs for an inch and a half : it is then inſerted into another cup like the firſt, but three times as large ; the&nbsp;glans afterwards gradually becomes thicker, and at about&nbsp;nine inches from the opening of the urethra are placed&nbsp;two bodies on the upper part of the glans, very like the&nbsp;nipples of a milch-cow, and as large ; theſe become&nbsp;turgid when the penis is erected ; the whole of this is&nbsp;contained in the prepuce, and may be conſidered as&nbsp;glans. From the os pubis ariſes a ſtrong muſcle, which&nbsp;ſoon becomes tendinous : this tendon is continued along&nbsp;the back or upper part of the penis ; it is flattened, is&nbsp;about the ſize of a man’s little finger, and is inſerted into the upper part of the glans, near the end. The uſe&nbsp;of this muſcle is to ſtraiten the penis. On the under&nbsp;ſide of the penis there are two muſcles, antagoniſts to&nbsp;the above ; they ariſe from the os ifchium fleſhy, run&nbsp;along tlie lower ſide of the penis, on each ſide of the&nbsp;corpus ſpongioſum, and are inſerted fleſhy into the lower&nbsp;ſide of the glans ; the action of theſe muſcles will draw&nbsp;in the penis, and bend it. The male has two nipples,&nbsp;like the female, ſituated between the hind legs; they are&nbsp;about half an inch in length, of a pyramidal form,&nbsp;rounded at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot; The whole ſkin of the animal is rough, and covered very thinly with ſhort black hair. The ſkin was not&nbsp;more than one third of an inch in thickneſs at the&nbsp;ſtrongeſt part ; under the belly it was hardly a quarter&nbsp;of an inch ; any part of it might be cut through with&nbsp;eaſe by a common diſſecting knife. The animal had&nbsp;not that appearance of armour which is obſerved in the&nbsp;ſingle-horned rhinoceros. Since I diſſected the male, I&nbsp;have had an opportunity of examining a female, which&nbsp;was more of a lead colour : it was younger than the&nbsp;male, and had not ſo many folds or wrinkles in its ſkin;&nbsp;of courſe it had ſtill leſs the appearance of armour. The&nbsp;only external mark which diſtinguiſhes it from the male&nbsp;is the vagina, which is cloſe to the anus ; whereas in the&nbsp;male the opening for the penis is 18 inches below the&nbsp;anus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the difference between this account and Spar-man’s, which in ſome particulars is conſiderable, and from the difference of ſhape, we are diſpoſed to think&nbsp;them varieties. Mr Bruce’s drawing of the rhinoceros&nbsp;bicornis is unqueſtionably a deception ; the body of&nbsp;the animal, as there repreſented, correſponds exactly&nbsp;with that of the unicornis except in its having two horns&nbsp;on its head. In the muſeum of the late Dr William&nbsp;Hunter, the two-horned animal was preſerved, agreeing&nbsp;exactly with the general accounts and figures we have&nbsp;of that animal, but differing eſſentially from Mr Bruce’s.&nbsp;For further particulars reſpecting theſe curious animals,&nbsp;we refer to Buffon, vol. vi. p. 92—117 ; Sparman's&nbsp;Voyage to the Cape, vol. ii. chap. 12.; and Bruce’s&nbsp;Travels, vol. iv. p. 296, &amp;c. and Appendix, p. 85, &amp;c.</span></p>

They&nbsp;preſerve the verdure of their leaves throughout the year.&nbsp;From the loweſt branches iffue long roots, which hang&nbsp;down to the water, and penetrate into the earth. In&nbsp;this poſition they reſemble ſo many arcades, from five&nbsp;to ten feet high, which ſerve to ſupport the body of&nbsp;the tree, and even to advance it daily into the bed of&nbsp;the water. Theſe arcades are ſo cloſely intertwiſted&nbsp;one with another, that they form a kind of natural and&nbsp;tranſparent terrace, raiſed with ſuch ſolidity over the&nbsp;water, that one might walk upon them, were it not&nbsp;that the branches are too much encumbered with leaves.&nbsp;The moſt natural way of propagating theſe trees, is to&nbsp;ſuffer the ſeveral ſlender ſmall filaments which iſſue from&nbsp;the main branches to take root in the earth.
