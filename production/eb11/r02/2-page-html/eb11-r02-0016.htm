<p><span class="font2">Royale, with a statue of Louis XV., and the place du Parvis, with an equestrian statue of Joan of Arc. The rue de Vesle,&nbsp;the chief street, continued under other names, traverses the&nbsp;town from S.W. to N.W., passing through the Place Royale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Oldest monument in Reims is the Mars Gate (so called from a temple to Mars in the neighbourhood), a triumphal arch 108 ft. in&nbsp;length by 43 in height, consisting of three archways flanked by&nbsp;columns. It is popularly supposed to have been erected by the&nbsp;Remi in honour of Augustus when Agrippa made the great roads&nbsp;terminating at the town, but probably belongs to the 3rd or 4th&nbsp;century. In its vicinity a curious </span><span class="font2">mosaic, </span><span class="font1">measuring 36. ft. by 26,&nbsp;with thirty-five medallions representing animals and gladiators, was&nbsp;discovered in i860. To these remains must be added a Gallo-Roman sarcophagus, said to be that of the consul Jovinus (see below)&nbsp;and preserved in the archaeological museum in the cloister of the&nbsp;abbey of St Remi. The cathedral of Notre-Dame, where the kings&nbsp;of France used to be crowned, replaced an older church (burned in&nbsp;1211) built on the site of the basilica where Clovis was baptized by&nbsp;St Remigius. The cathedral, with the exception of the west front,&nbsp;was completed by the end of the 13th century. That portion was&nbsp;erected in the 14th century after 13th-century designs—the nave&nbsp;having in the meantime been lengthened to afford room for the&nbsp;crowds that attended the coronations. In 1481 fire destroyed the&nbsp;roof and the spires. In 1875 the National Assembly voted £80,000&nbsp;for repairs of the façade and balustrades. This façade is the finest&nbsp;portion of the building, and one of the most perfect masterpieces of&nbsp;the middle ages. The three portals are laden with statues and&nbsp;statuettes. The central portal, dedicated to the Virgin, is surmounted&nbsp;by a rose-window framed in an arch itself decorated with statuary.&nbsp;The “ gallery of the kings ” above has the baptism of Clovis in the&nbsp;centre and statues of his successors. The towers, 267 ft. high, were&nbsp;originally designed to rise 394 ft.; that on the south contains two&nbsp;great bells, one of which, named “ Charlotte ” by Cardinal de&nbsp;Lorraine in 1570, weighs more than </span><span class="font0">n </span><span class="font1">tons. The façades of the&nbsp;transepts are also decorated with sculptures—that on the north&nbsp;with statues of the principal bishops of Reims, a representation of&nbsp;the Last Judgment and a figure of Christ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(le Beau Dieu)</span><span class="font1"> while that&nbsp;on the south side has a beautiful rose-window with the prophets and&nbsp;apostles. Of the four towers which flanked the transepts nothing&nbsp;remains above the height of the roof since the fire of 1481. Above&nbsp;the choir rises an elegant bell-tower in timber and lead, 59 ft. high,&nbsp;reconstructed in the 15th century. The interior of the cathedral&nbsp;is 455 ft. long, 98 ft. wide in the nave, and 125 ft. high in the centre,&nbsp;and comprises a nave with aisles, transepts with aisles, a choir with&nbsp;double aisles, and an apse with deambulatory and radiating chapels.&nbsp;It has a profusion of statues similar to those of the outside, and&nbsp;stained glass of the 13th century. The rose-window over the main&nbsp;portal and the gallery beneath are of rare magnificence. The&nbsp;cathedral possesses fine tapestries. Of these the most important&nbsp;series is that presented by Robert de Lenoncourt, archbishop under&nbsp;Francis I., representing the life of the Virgin. The north transept&nbsp;contains a fine organ in a Flamboyant Gothic case. The choir&nbsp;clock is ornamented with curious mechanical figures. Several&nbsp;paintings, by Tintoretto, Nicolas Poussin, and others, and the&nbsp;carved woodwork and the railings of the choir, also deserve mention.&nbsp;The treasury contains the Sainte Ampoule, or holy flask, the successor&nbsp;of the ancient one broken at the Revolution (see below), a fragment&nbsp;of which it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The archiépiscopal palace, built between 1498 and 1509, and in part rebuilt in 1675, was occupied by the kings on the occasion&nbsp;of their coronation. The saloon (salle du Tau), where the royal&nbsp;banquet was held, has an immense stone chimney of the 15th century,&nbsp;medallions of the archbishops of Reims, and portraits of fourteen&nbsp;kings crowned in the city. Among the other rooms of the royal&nbsp;suite, all of which are of great beauty and richness, is that now used&nbsp;for the meetings of the Reims Academy ; the building also contains a&nbsp;library. The chapel of the archiépiscopal palace consists of two&nbsp;storeys, of which the upper still serves as a place of worship. Both&nbsp;the chapel and the salle du Tau are decorated with tapestries of the&nbsp;17th century, known as the Perpersack tapestries, after the Flemish&nbsp;weaver who executed them..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the cathedral, which it almost equals in size, the most celebrated church is St Remi, once attached to an important abbey,&nbsp;the buildings of which are used as a hospital. St Remi dates from&nbsp;the nth, 12th, 13th and 15th centuries. The nave and transepts,&nbsp;Romanesque in style, date mainly from the earliest, the façade of the&nbsp;south transept from the latest, of those periods, the choir and apse&nbsp;chapels from the 12th and 13th centuries. The valuable monuments with which the church was at one time filled were pillaged&nbsp;during the Revolution, and even the tomb of the saint is a modern&nbsp;work; but there remain the 12th-century glass windows of the apse&nbsp;and tapestries representing the history of St Remigius, given by&nbsp;Robert de Lenoncourt. The churches of St Jacques, St Maurice&nbsp;(partly rebuilt in 1867), St André, and St Thomas (erected from&nbsp;1847. to 1853, under the patronage of Cardinal Gousset, now buried&nbsp;within its walls), are all of minor interest. Of the fine church of&nbsp;St Nicaisc only insignificant remains arc to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The town hall, erected in the 17th and enlarged in the 19th century, has a pediment with an equestrian statue of Louis XIIL&nbsp;and a tall and elegant campanile. It contains a picture gallery,&nbsp;ethnographical, archaeological and other collections, and the public&nbsp;library. There are many old houses, the House of the Musicians&nbsp;(13th century) being so called from the seated figures of musicians&nbsp;which decorate the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1874 the construction of a chain of detached forts was begun in the vicinity, Reims being selected as one of the chief&nbsp;defences of the northern approaches of Paris. The ridge of&nbsp;St Thierry is crowned with a fort of the same name, which&nbsp;with the neighbouring work of Chenay closes the west side of&nbsp;the place. To the north the hill of Brimont has three works&nbsp;guarding the Laon railway and the Aisne canal. Farther east,&nbsp;on the old Roman road, lies the fort de Fresnes. Due east the&nbsp;hills of Arnay are crowned with five large and important works&nbsp;which cover the approaches from the upper Aisne. Forts&nbsp;Pompelle and Montbré close the south-east side, and the Falaise&nbsp;hills on the Paris side are open and unguarded. The perimeter&nbsp;of the defences is not quite 22 m., and the forts are a mean&nbsp;distance of 6 m. from the centre of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reims is the seat of an archbishop, a court of assize and a sub-prefect. It is an important centre for the combing,&nbsp;carding and spinning of wool and the weaving of flannel, merino,&nbsp;cloth and woollen goods of all kinds, these industries employing&nbsp;some 24,000 hands; dyeing and “ dressing ” are also carried&nbsp;on. It is the chief wool market in France, and has a “ conditioning house ” which determines the loss of weight resulting&nbsp;from the drying of the wool. The manufacture of and trade&nbsp;in champagne is also very important. The wine is stored in&nbsp;large cellars tunnelled in the chalk. Other manufactures are&nbsp;machinery, chemicals, safes, capsules, bottles, casks, candles,&nbsp;soap and paper. The town is well known for its cakes and&nbsp;biscuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font2">Before the Roman conquest Reims, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Durocor-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">torum,</span><span class="font2"> was capital of the Remi, from whose name that of the town was subsequently derived. The Remi made voluntary&nbsp;submission to the Romans, and by their fidelity throughout the&nbsp;various Gallic insurrections secured the special favour of their&nbsp;conquerors. Christianity was established in the town by&nbsp;the middle of the 3rd century, at which period the bishopric&nbsp;was founded. The consul Jovinus, an influential supporter&nbsp;of the new faith, repulsed the barbarians who invaded Champagne in 336; but the Vandals captured the town in 406 and&nbsp;slew St Nicasus, and Attila afterwards put it to fire and sword.&nbsp;Clovis, after his victory at Soissons (486), was baptized at&nbsp;Reims in 496 by St Remigius. Later kings desired to be&nbsp;consecrated at Reims with the oil of the sacred phial which was&nbsp;believed to have been brought from heaven by a dove for the&nbsp;baptism of Clovis and was preserved in the abbey of St Remi.&nbsp;Meetings of Pope Stephen III. with Pippin the Short, and of&nbsp;Leo III. with Charlemagne, took place at Reims; and here&nbsp;Louis the Debonnaire was crowned by Stephen IV. Louis IV.&nbsp;gave the town and countship of Reims to the archbishop&nbsp;Artaldus in 940. Louis VII. gave the title of duke and peer&nbsp;to William of Champagne, archbishop from 1176 to 1202, and&nbsp;the archbishops of Reims took precedence of the other ecclesiastical peers of the realm. In the 10th century Reims had&nbsp;become a centre of intellectual culture. Archbishop Adalberon,&nbsp;seconded by the monk Gerbert (afterwards Pope Silvester II.),.&nbsp;having founded schools where the “ liberal arts ” were taught.&nbsp;Adalberon was also one of the prime authors of the revolution&nbsp;which put the Capet house in the place of the Carolingians.&nbsp;The most important prerogative of the archbishops was the&nbsp;consecration of the kings of France—a privilege which was&nbsp;exercised, except in a few cases, from the time of Philip Augustus&nbsp;to that of Charles X. Louis VII. granted the town a communal&nbsp;charter in 1139. The treaty of Troyes (1420) ceded it to the&nbsp;English, who had made a futile attempt to take it by siege in&nbsp;1360; but they were expelled on the approach of Joan of Arc,&nbsp;who in 1429 caused Charles VII. to be consecrated in the&nbsp;cathedral. A revolt at Reims, caused by the salt tax in 1461,&nbsp;was cruelly repressed by Louis XI. The town sided with the&nbsp;League (1585), but submitted to Henry IV. after the battle of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
