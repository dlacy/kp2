<p><label>RUTLANDSHIRE</label>
is the leaſt county in England, it being but 40 miles in circumference ; in which are two towns, 48 pariſhes, and 3263 houſes. However, ſor quality it may be compared with any other county; the air being good, and the ſoil fertile both for tillage and paſtures ; and it not only <hi rend="sup">r</hi> affords plenty of corn, but feeds a grcat number of horned cattle and flreep. It is well watered with brooks and rivulets ; and the principal rivers are the Weland and the Waſh. It is bounded on the eaſt by Lincolnſhire ; on the· ſouth by the river Weland, which parts it from Northamptonſhire; and on the welt and north by Leiceſteiſhire. It has only two market-towns ; namely, Okeham, where the affizeâ and ſeffions are held, and Uppingham.</p>
