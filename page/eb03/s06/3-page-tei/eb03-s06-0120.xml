And, laſtly, if neither of theſe methods is agreed to by the patient, we can, by means oſ a constant regular preſſure, obliterate the cavity of the artery at the place where the operation has been performed, by producing the accretien of its ſides. Different bandages have been contrived for compreſſing the temporal artery ; but none of them anſwer the purpoſe ſo eaſily and ſo effectually as the one figured in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 10. This method is more tedious ; but to timid patients it generally proves more acceptable than either of the other two.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Topical Blooding.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When,</hi> either ſrom the ſeverity of a local fixed pain, or from any other cauſe, it is wiſhed to evacuate blood directly from the ſmall veſſels of the part affected, inſtead of opening any of the larger arteries or veins, the following are the different modes proposed for effecting it, viz. by means of leeches ; by slight ſcarifications with the ſhoulder or edge of a lancet ; and, laſtly, by means of an inſtrument termed a <hi rend="italic">ſcarificator,</hi> (Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 11.) ; in which ſixteen or twenty lancets are commonly placed, in ſuch a manner, that, when the inſtrument is applied to the part affected, the whole number of lancets contained in it are, by means of a ſtrong ſpring, pushed ſuddenly into it, to the depth at which the inſtrument has been previouſly regulated. This being done, as the ſmaller blood-veſſels only by this operation are ever intended to be cut, and as theſe do not commonly diſcharge freely, ſome means or other become neceſſary for promoting the evacuation.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for this purpoſe. Glaſſes fitted to the form of the affected parts, with a ſmall hole in the bottom of each, were long ago contrived : and theſe being placed upon the ſcarified parts, a degree of ſuction was produced by a perſon’s mouth ſufficient for nearly exhausting the air contained in the glaſs : and this accordingly was a ſure enough method of increaſing the evacuation of blood to a certain extent. But as this was attended with a good deal of trouble, and beſides did not on every occaſion prove altogether effectual, an exhauſting ſyringe was at laſt adapted to the glaſs : which did indeed anſwer as a very certain method of extracting the air contained in it ; but the application of this inſtrument for any length of time is very troubleſome, and it is difficult to preſerve the ſyringe always air-tight.</p><p>The application of heat to the <hi rend="italic">cupping-glaſſes,</hi> repreſented in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 12. has been found to rarefy the air contained in them to a degree ſufficient for producing a very conſiderable ſuction. And as the inſtrument in this ſimple form anſwers the purpoſe in view with very little trouble to the operator, and as it is at all times eaſily obtained, the uſe of the ſyringe has therefore been laid aſide.</p><p>There are different methods adopted ſor thus applying heat to the cavity of the glaſs. By ſupporting the mouth of it for a few ſeconds above the flame of a taper, the air may be ſufficiently rarefied ; but if the flame is not kept exactly in the middle, but is allowed to touch either the sides or bottom of the glaſs, it is very apt to make it crack. A more certain, as well as an eaſier, method of applying the heat, is to dip a piece of ſoft bibulous paper in ſpirit of wine ; and having ſet it on fire, to put it into the bottom of the glaſs, and, on its being nearly extinguiſhed, to apply the mouth of the inſtrument directly upon the ſcarified part. This degree of heat, which may be always regulated by the ſize of the piece of paper, and which it is evident ought to be always in proportion to the ſize of the glaſs, if long enough applied, proves always ſufficient for rarefying the air very effectually, and at the ſame time, if done with any manner of caution, never injures the glaſs in the leaſt.</p><p>The glaſs having been thus applied, if the ſcarifications have been properly made, they inſtantly begin to diſcharge freely : and ſo ſoon as the inſtrument is nearly full of blood, it ſhould be taken away ; which may be always eaſily done by raiſing one side of it, ſo as to give acceſs to the external air. When more blood is wiſhed to be taken, the parts ſhould be bathed with warm water; and being made perfectly dry, another glaſs, exactly the ſize of the former, ſhould be inſtantly applied in the very ſame manner : and thus, if the ſcarificator has been made to puſh to a ſufficient depth, so as to have cut all the cutaneous veſſels of the part, almoſt any neceſſary quantity of blood may be obtained. It ſometimes happens, however, that the full quantity intended to be discharged cannot be got at one place. In ſuch a caſe, the ſcarificator muſt be again applied on a part as contiguous to the other as poſſible ; and this being done, the application of the glaſſes muſt alſo be renewed as before.</p><p>When it is wiſhed to diſcharge the quantity oſ blood as quickly as poſſible, two or more glaſſes may be applied at once on contiguous parts previouſly ſcarified ; and, on ſome occaſions, the quantity of blood is more quickly obtained by the cupping-glaſſes being applied for a few ſeconds upon the parts to be afterwards ſcarified. The ſuction produced by the glaſſes may poſſibly have ſome influence in bringing the more deep-ſeated veſſels into nearer contact with the skin, ſo that more of them will be cut by the ſcarificator.</p><p>A ſufficient quantity of blood being procured, the wounds made by the different lancets ſhould be all perfectly cleared of blood ; and a bit of ſoft linen or charpie, dipped in a little milk or cream, applied over the whoſe, is the only dreſſing that is neceſſary. When dry linen is applied, it not only creates more uneaſiness to the patient, but renders the wounds more apt to fester than when it has been previouſly wetted in the manner directed.</p><p>Dry cupping conſiſts in the application of the cupping- glaſſes directly to the parts affected, without the uſe of the ſcarificator. By this means a tumor is produced upon the part ; and where any advantage is to be expected from a determination of blood to a particular ſpot, it may probably be more eaſily accompliſhed by this means than by any other.</p><p>When the part from which it is intended to produce a local evacuation of this kind is ſo ſituated, that a ſcarificator and cupping-glaſſes can be applied, this method is greatly preferable to every other ; but in inflammatory affections of the eye, of the noſe, and of other parts of the face, &amp;c. the ſcarificator cannot be properly applied directly to the parts affected. In ſuch inſtances, leeches are commonly</p></body></text></TEI>
