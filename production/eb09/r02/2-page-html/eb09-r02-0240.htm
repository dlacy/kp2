<p><span class="font1">comitia of the tribes. The first, if not organized by Servius Tullius, at all events grew out of his distribution&nbsp;of the populace into classes and centuries according to the&nbsp;value of their freeholds as appearing on the census-list.&nbsp;As just the national army assembled for a peaceful purpose&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{exerritus civilis),</span><span class="font1"> it could be convened and presided over&nbsp;originally only by a magistrate possessing the military&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium, i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> a consul ; but, after the creation of the&nbsp;censorship in 311 and the prætorship in 387, the holders&nbsp;of those offices were entitled to convoke it,—the former&nbsp;for its assent to arrangements for the census, and the&nbsp;latter for state trials. It was the centuries that passed&nbsp;the XII. Tables ; but for the most part their legislation&nbsp;was upon questions affecting public and constitutional&nbsp;rather than private interests. The procedure in the&nbsp;centuriate comitia was somewhat cumbrous. There was&nbsp;publication of the proposed law </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(promulgatio rogationis)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a fortnight before the day appointed, sometimes one or&nbsp;more meetings </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(conciones)</span><span class="font1"> being held in the interval for&nbsp;its consideration and discussion. When the day arrived,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia</span><span class="font1"> were taken by the presiding magistrate,&nbsp;assisted by an augur; if favourable, the citizens were&nbsp;summoned anew by blast of trumpet, and on their&nbsp;assembling, which originally they did under arms, prayer&nbsp;and sacrifice were offered by president, pontiffs, and&nbsp;augurs. A final </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concio</span><span class="font1"> might then be held if thought&nbsp;necessary ; and, after it was over, on the order to “ proceed&nbsp;to the comitia,” the citizens marched to the Campus&nbsp;Martius (the formal assembly being incompetent within&nbsp;the city). There the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rogatio</span><span class="font1"> was read and, if no sign&nbsp;from heaven indicated the dissent of the gods and warned&nbsp;the assembly to disperse, was at once put to the vote—-“ Is it your pleasure, Quirites, to hold this as law ? ” The&nbsp;vote was taken by centuries, those of the knights and the&nbsp;freeholders of full valuation voting first ; if they were&nbsp;unanimous it went no further, for these formed more than&nbsp;a majority of the whole </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia.</span><span class="font1"> The resolution, if&nbsp;adopted, was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populi jussum,</span><span class="font1"> but not yet law. It had&nbsp;still to run the gauntlet of the “fathers,”—whether the&nbsp;senate or only its patrician members is disputed ; it was&nbsp;in their power to refuse to authorize it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(audores fieri),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">usually putting their dissent on the ground that the gods&nbsp;willed it not ; but if they ratified it, then it became a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ordinarily getting the name of the magistrate by whom it&nbsp;had been proposed. The power of veto, however, was&nbsp;considerably qualified by a Publilian law of the year 415,&nbsp;which enacted that in future the “ fathers ” should grant&nbsp;(or refuse) their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas</span><span class="font1"> before the vote was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The points of difference between the enactments of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis</span><span class="font1"> and the later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa</span><span class="font1"> are indicated&nbsp;by Mommsen in a paper in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Researches.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> (1) The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was an assembly of the whole body of the people,&nbsp;voting according to tribes instead of centuries ; the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium</span><span class="font1"> was an assembly of plebeians only, also voting&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tributim.</span><span class="font1"> (2) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was convened and presided&nbsp;over by a patrician magistrate, not necessarily, however,&nbsp;with military </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium,</span><span class="font1"> and therefore very frequently by&nbsp;the prætor ; whereas the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilnιm</span><span class="font1"> could be convened and&nbsp;presided over only by a plebeian official, either a tribune&nbsp;or an ædile. (3) In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia</span><span class="font1"> had to be&nbsp;taken before the proceedings commenced ; in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the will of the gods was not demanded, although listened&nbsp;to if communicated in a thunder-storm or the like. (4)&nbsp;The resolution of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> required to be confirmed by&nbsp;the “fathers”; while that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium</span><span class="font1"> did not. (5)&nbsp;An enactment of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex,</span><span class="font1"> and bound the&nbsp;whole people ; but before the Hortensian law an enactment by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis</span><span class="font1"> was in the ordinary case no&nbsp;more than a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebiscitum,</span><span class="font1"> and of force only amongst the&nbsp;plebeians themselves. But there was an exception when,&nbsp;because of some constitutional change proposed by it, the&nbsp;senate had previously sanctioned the legislation, as in the&nbsp;case of the Terentilian law, which paved the way for the&nbsp;XII. Tables, of the Canuleian law authorizing the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians, of the Licinian laws&nbsp;about the occupation of the public lands, &amp;c. ; in such&nbsp;cases, although the final vote was that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;enactment was binding on the citizens generally, and was&nbsp;spoken of as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex</span><span class="font1"> rather than as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebiscitum.</span><span class="font1"> The latter&nbsp;name seems practically to have been dropped after the&nbsp;Hortensian law had equalized them so far as their effects&nbsp;were concerned. The greater part of the legislation for&nbsp;amending the private law latterly fell to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">owing so far, perhaps, to the greater simplicity of its procedure, but also to some extent to the fact that the&nbsp;prætors preferred making their amendments tentatively&nbsp;by edicts (which were revocable), instead of embodying&nbsp;them in statutes, which, as passed under divine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auspices&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and representing the divine will, could not easily be&nbsp;repealed.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The XII. Tables.—</span><span class="font1">We have already shown the efforts made by Servius Tullius to secure that the dispensation of&nbsp;justice should neither be neglected nor left to caprice or haphazard, one rule to-day and another to-morrow. With the&nbsp;consulate and the disregard of the “ royal laws ” and of&nbsp;Servius’s instructions to the judges all this was changed.&nbsp;The consuls, with their harassing military engagements,&nbsp;could have little time to devote to their judicial functions&nbsp;or properly to instruct those to whom they delegated the&nbsp;duty of investigating and adjudicating on the merits of a&nbsp;complaint ; and the yearly change of magistrates must&nbsp;itself have been a serious obstacle to uniformity either of&nbsp;rule or practice so long as the law rested on nothing but&nbsp;unwritten custom. One can well believe too, when feeling&nbsp;was so embittered between the orders, that it was no rare&nbsp;thing for a consul to use his magisterial punitive powers&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(coercitio)</span><span class="font1"> with undue severity when a plebeian was the&nbsp;object of them, or to turn a deaf ear to an appeal for&nbsp;justice addressed to him from such a quarter. The state&nbsp;of matters had become so intolerable that in the year&nbsp;292 the demand was made by C. Terentilius Arsa, one&nbsp;of the tribunes, that a commission should be appointed to&nbsp;define in writing the jurisdiction of the magistrates, so&nbsp;that a check might be put on their arbitrary, highhanded, and oppressive administration of what they were&nbsp;pleased to call the law. His colleagues induced him for&nbsp;the moment not to press his demand, which he was urging&nbsp;with a violence of invective that was unlikely to promote&nbsp;his object. But next year they made common cause with&nbsp;him, requiring that the whole law, public and private,&nbsp;should be codified, and its uncertainty thus as far as&nbsp;possible be removed. After a few years’ resistance the&nbsp;senate was induced to give its assent to a demand that in&nbsp;itself was too reasonable to be longer withstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first practical step towards its realization was the despatch of a mission to Greece and the Greek settlements&nbsp;in southern Italy, to study their statute law and collect&nbsp;any materials that might be of service in preparing the&nbsp;projected code. On the return of the ambassadors in&nbsp;302 all the magistracies were suspended, and a commission&nbsp;of ten patricians </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(decemviri legibus scribundis)</span><span class="font1"> was appointed&nbsp;with consular powers, under the presidency of Appius&nbsp;Claudius, for the express purpose of reducing the laws to&nbsp;writing. Before the end of the ensuing year (303) the&nbsp;bulk of the code was ready, and was at once passed into&nbsp;law by the comitia of the centuries, and engraved or perhaps painted on ten tables of wood, which were exposed&nbsp;in the Forum. Next year the decemvirate was renewed</span></p>
