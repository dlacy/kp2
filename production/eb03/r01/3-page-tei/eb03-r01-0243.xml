The unicorn of Scripture is confidered as having all the properties of the rhinoceros, as rage, untameableneſs, great ſwiftneſs, and vaſt ſtrength. This opinion is moſt ably ſupported by Mr Bruce. " The derivation of the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">reem</hi>  (ſays he), which in our verſion is tranſlated <hi rend="italic">unicorn,</hi>  both in the Hebrew and the Ethiopic, ſeems to be from ereôfnefs, or handing ſtraight. This is certainly no particular quality in the animal itſelf, who is not more or even ſo much erect as many other quadrupeds, ſor in its knees it is rather crooked; but it is from the circumſtance and manner in which itshorn is placed. The horns of all other animals are inclined to ſome degree of paralleliſm with his noſe or os frontis. '1 he horn of the rhinoceros is erect and perpendicular to this bone, on which it ſtands at right angles, thereby poſſeſſing a greater purchaſe or power, as a lever, than an horn could poffibly have in any other poſition. The ſituation of the horn is very happily alluded to in Scripture ; ‘ My horn ſhalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn.’ And the horn here alluded to is not wholly figurative, but was really an ornament worn by great men in the days of victory, preferment, or rejoicing, when they were anointed with new, ſweet, or freſh oil ; a circumſtance which David joins with that of erecting the horn.</p><p>" Some authors, for what reaſon I know not, have made the reem, or unicorn, to be of the deer or antelope kind ; that is, of a genus whoſe very character is fear and weaknefs, directly oppoſite to the qualities by which the reem is deſcribed in Scripture : beſides, it is plain that the reem is not of the claſs of clean quadru-peds ; and a late modern traveller very wllimſically takes him for the leviathan, which certainly was a ſiſh. Balaam, a prieſt of Midian, and ſo in the neighbourhood of the haunts of the rhinoceros, and intimately connected with Ethiopia, (for they themſelves were ſhepherds of that country), in a tranſport, from contemplating the ſtrength of Iſrael, whom he was brought to curſe, ſays, they had, as it were, the ſtrength oſ the reem. Job makes frequent alluſion to his great ſtrength, ferocity, and indocility. He aſks, 'Will the reem be willing to ſerve thee, or abide by thy crib ?’ that is, Will lie willingly come into thy ſtable, and eat at thy manger ? And again, ‘ Canſt thou bind the reem witli a band in the furrow ; and will lie harrow tlie valleys ſor thee ?’— In other words, Canſt thou make him go to the plough or harrows?</p><p>" The rhinoceros, in Geez, is called <hi rend="italic">A rave Harich, </hi>and in the Amharic <hi rend="italic">Auraris ;</hi>  both which names ſigniſy ‘ the large wild beaſt with the horn.’ This would ſeem as if applied to the ſpecies witli one horn. On the other hand, in the conntry of the Shangalla and in Nubia he is called <hi rend="italic">Girnamgim,</hi>  or ‘ horn upon horn;’ and this would ſeem to denote that he had two. The Ethiopic text renders the word <hi rend="italic">reem,</hi>  ‘ Arwe-Harich and this the Septuagint tianſſates <hi rend="italic">monoceros,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">unicorn.</hi>  The principal reaſon of tranſiating the word <hi rend="italic">unicorn</hi>  rather than <hi rend="italic">rhinoceros,</hi>  is from ?. prejudice that he muſt have had but one horn. But this is by no means ſo well founded as to be admitted the only argument for eſtabliſhing tlie exiſtence of an animal, which never has appeared after the ſearch of ſo many ages. Scripture ſpeaks of tlie horns of tlie unicorn ; fo that even from this circumſtance tlie reem may be the rhinoceros, as tlie Aſiatic, and part of tlie African rhinoceros, may be the unicorn.”</p><p>Tlie rhinoceros bicornis was long known in Europe merely by the double horns wliich were preferved in va-rious cabinets ; and its exiſtence, though now paſt all doubt, has been frequently queſtioned. Dr Sparman, in his voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, killed two of theſe animals, wliicli he diffected, and very minutely deſcribes. The horns, lie ſays, in the live animal are ſo mobile and looie, that wlien it walks careleſsly along, one may ſee tliem waggle about, and hear them claſh and clatter againſt each other. In tlie Phil. Tranſ. ſor 1793, we have a deſcription of tlie double-horned rhinoceros of Sumatra, by Mr Bell, ſurgeon in the ſervice of the Eaſt India Company at Bencoolen ; and this account, though it differs conſiderably from that of Sparman in ſome particulars, we ſhall infert here. “ The animal (ſays· Mr Bell) herein defcribed was ſhot with a leaden ball· from a muſket about ten miles from Fort Marlborough.</p><p>I ſaw it the day after ; it was then not in the leaſt pu-trid, and I put it into the poſition from which the accompanying drawing was made. (See Plate ccccxxxvm.) It was a male ; the height at the ſhoulder was 4 feet 4 inches ; at the ſacrum nearly the ſame ; from the tip of the noſe to the end of the tail eight feet five inches.— From the appearance of its teeth and bones it was but young, and probably not near its full ſize. The ſhape of the animal was much like that of the hog. The ge-neral colour was a browniſh aſh ; under the belly, be-tween the legs and folds of the ſkin, a dirty ſſeſh co-lour. The head much reſembled that of the Angle horned rhinoceros ; the eyes were ſmall, of a brown colour j the <hi rend="italic">membrana nictitans</hi>  thick and ſtrong : the ſkin fur-rounding the eyes was wrinkled ; the noſtrils were wide;, the upper lip was pointed, and hanging over the under.</p><p>" There were fix <hi rend="italic">molares,</hi>  or grinders, on each ſide of the upper and lower jaw, becoming gradually larger backward, particularly in the upper ; two teeth in the front of each jaw ; the tongue was quite ſmooth ; the ears were ſmall and pointed, lined and edged with ſhort black hair, and ſituated like thoſe of the ſingle-horned rhinoceros. The horns were black, the larger was placed immediately above the noſe, pointing upwards,, and was bent a little back; it was about nine inches-long. The ſmall horn was four inches long, of a pyra-midal ſhape, flattened a little, and placed above the eyes, rather a little more forward, ſtanding in a line with the larger-horn, immediately above it. They were both firmly attached to the ſkull, nor was there any appear-ance of joint or muſcles to move them @@(C). The neck was thick and ſhort, the ſkin on the under ſide thrown in</p><p>@@@(C) Mr Bruce, however, ſays, that in the living animal the horns are extremely ſenſible.
