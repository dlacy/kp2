 in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetrandria claſs<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0693.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0687"/>
of planta; and in the natural method ranking under the 48th order, <hi rend="italic">Aggregatae.</hi> The common calyx is polyphyllous; the proper one is double ſuperior; the receptacle is paleaceous or naked. The moſt remarkable ſpecies are, 1. The arvenſis, or meadow-ſcabious, grows naturally in many places of Britain. It hath a ſtrong, thick, fibrous root, lending out many branching ſtalks, which riſe to the height of three feet; the lower leaves are ſometimes almoſt entire, and at others they are cut into many ſegments almoſt to the midrib. The flowers are produced upon naked footſtalks at the end of the branches; they are of a purple colour, and have a faint odour. 2. The ſucciſa, or devil’s bit, grows naturally in woods and moiſt places. This has a ſhort tap-root, the end of which appears as if it was bitten or cut off, whence the plant has taken its name. The leaves are oval and ſpear-ſhaped, and ſmooth; the ſtalks are Angle, about two feet high, garniſhed with two leaves at each joint; they generally fend out two ſhort foot-ſtalks from their upper joint, ſtanding oppoſite, which are terminated by purple flowers. —Both tħeſe have been recommended as aperient, ſudorific, and expectorant; but the preſent practice has no dependence on them.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
