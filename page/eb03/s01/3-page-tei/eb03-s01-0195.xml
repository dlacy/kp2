            <p>his foragers cut off, ſo that he was reduced to diſtreſs; and at laſt his fleet being
                totally deſtroyed by a ſtorm, he was obliged to return to England without
                accompliſhing any thing.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the prince of Wales, who had been left by his father to carry on the
                war in France, defeated and took priſoner John king of France at the battle of
                Poictiers. In this battle were 3000 Scots, who had gone over as auxiliaries to the
                French monarch, and who ſuffered extremely. However, the ſucceſs of Edward, inſtead
                of rendering him haughty, ſeemed to have a contrary effect; and, by the mediation of
                Pope Innocent, a truce for two years was concluded with France, in which the Scots
                were comprehended. During this interval, the ranſom of the king of Scots was ſettled
                at 100,000 merks to be paid in ten years; for which 20 hoſtages were to be given as
                formerly. In conſequence of this treaty, David at laſt obtained his liberty in 1358;
                and Edward laid aſide all hopes of ever ſubduing Scotland. As for Baliol, he was now
                ſunk in oblivion; and it is not known what became of him, or when he died.</p>
            <p>David, though now reſtored to liberty, found himſelf greatly embarraſſed with the
                payment of ſuch a large ſum as had been ſtipulated for his ranſom; the kingdom of
                Scotland being then in a moſt miſerable and exhauſted ſituation. After ſending his
                queen, and going into England himſelf, he could obtain no greater favour than a
                reſpite of a few months for the payment of the ſecond moiety; ſo that he was at laſt
                conſtrained to aſk aſſiſtance from France. This could ſcarcely be expected in the
                diſtrefled ſituation of that kingdom; however, it</p>
            <p>was at laſt agreed, that 50,000 marks ſhould be paid to Scotland, in case the Scots
                would conſent to renew the war the following year. Neither party, however, kept
                their word; and David, being ſtill greatly diſtreſsed about the remainder of his
                ranſom, at laſt entered into a very extraordinary negociation with Edward, by which
                he conſented that the king of England ſhould be his ſucceſſor to the throne of
                Scotland. But this negociation was defeated through the invincible hatred which the
                Scots bore to an Engliſh governor. David then, being entirely unable to diſcharge
                the remainder of his ranſom, was obliged to enter into a new treaty; by which the
                kingdom of Scotland became indebted to Edward the ſum of 100,000 pounds Sterling, to
                be paid by equal proportions within the ſpace of 25 years, during which there ſhould
                be a truce between the two nations.</p>
            <p>From this time we meet with little more of any moment in the reign of King David.
                After the death of his Queen Johanna, the ſiſter of Edward, he married a Scots
                woman, of mean birth, named Margaret Logie; but by neither of his wives had he any
                children. Queen Margaret he divorced, on what pretence is not known; however, ſhe
                left the kingdom, and complained perſonally to the pope, who treated her as David’s
                lawful wife, and enjoined her huſband to receive her as ſuch under the moſt ſevere
                penalties. What effect theſe threats had on the king is not known; but it is certain
                that Margaret never returned to Scotland; and, on the 22d of February 1371, David
                himſelf died, leaving the kingdom to his nephew Robert Stewart, the firſt of that
                family who ſat on the throne of Scotland @@(K).</p>
            <p>@@@ <hi rend="smallcaps">(K)</hi> Concerning the origin of the Stewart family, we
                have the following account by the Scots hiſtorians. Fleance, the ſon of the
                celebrated Banquo, after his father’s murder by Macbeth, fled into Wales, where he
                had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Walter,</hi> by a princeſs of that country. After
                the reſtoration of Malcolm Canmore, this Walter returned to Scotland, where he was
                promoted to the high ſtewardſhip, a dignity held by ſervice, and which intitled the
                poſſeſſor to all the privileges of a baron. Waiter was now diſtinguiſhed, from this
                office, by the title of <hi rend="italic">Walter the Stewart,</hi> which deſcended
                to his poſterity; and <hi rend="italic">Steward,</hi> afterwards <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stewart,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stuart,</hi> became their ſurname.</p>
            <p>On this ſubject Lord Hailes has the following remarks. “Our hiſtorians have recorded
                the achievements of Walter the Stewart of Scotland in the reign of Malcolm III. He
                is ſaid to have been the father of Alan, and the grandfather of that Walter who was
                indeed Stewart of Scotland in the reign of David I. and Malcolm IV. It may perhaps
                be aſcribed to ſtrange prejudices, or to a ſpirit of ſcepticiſm, when I declare,
                that hitherto I have ſeen no evidence that ſuch a perſon as Walter Stewart of
                Scotland, in the reign of Malcolm III. did ever exiſt.</p>
            <p>“We are gravely told, ‘That Walter the ſon of Fleance, the ſon of Banquo, Thane of
                Lochaber, having killed a man at the court of Griffith, prince of Wales, fought
                refuge with Edward the Confeſſor; and having killed another man at Edward’s court,
                fought refuge with Alan the Red, earl of Brittany: That, on the Norman invaſion, he
                came to England with the earl of Brittany, and ſignalized himſelf at the battle of
                Haſtings in 1066: That the earl of Brittany, by his firſt wife Emma, daughter of
                Siward earl of Northumberland, had an only child Chriſtina; and that he bellowed her
                in marriage on the young hero.” This is the ſtory which, after various improvements
                ſince the days of Boece, has had the good fortune to obtain credit.</p>
            <p>“That Walter, before he had well attained to the age of manhood, ſhould have ſlain
                two men in private quarrels, is a circumſtance improbable, yet poſſible; and
                therefore I object not to it. But his alliance with the earl of Brittany cannot be
                ſo eaſily admitted.</p>
            <p>“Alan, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">le Roux,</hi> a younger ſon of Eudo earl of
                Brittany, was one of the gallant adventurers who came over with William the
                Conqueror; <hi rend="italic">he had neither territories nor court.</hi> The
                hiſtorians of Brittany poſitively aſſert that he had no children. Beſides, it is
                hard to ſay by what accident Alan <hi rend="italic">le Roux</hi> ſhould have become
                acquainted with Emma the daughter of Siward earl of Northumberland! I ſuppoſe that
                our hiſtorians invented this alliance, in order to ſtrengthen the connection between
                Walter the Stewart and Malcom III.</p>

            <p>“It is ſaid, ‘That Walter the Stewart had a ſon, Alan, alſo Stewart of Scotland.’ The
                evidence of this is to be found in a charter granted by Earl Goſpatrick, and in
                another charter granted by his ſon Waldeve Earl of March, at Dunbar. In them Alden,
                or Aldan Dapifer, is mentioned as a witneſs; that is, ſay our antiquaries, <hi
                    rend="italic">Allan, the stewart of Scotland.</hi></p>
            <p>"This is the fundamental propoſition on which the genealogy of the houſe of Stuart,
                as it is commonly underſtood, may be ſaid to reſt. It will be remarked, that this
                hypotheſis takes it for granted, that <hi rend="italic">Alden </hi>or <hi
                    rend="italic">Aldan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alan,</hi> are the ſame; upon
                what authority I know not. The Alden mentioned in the two charters ſeems to have
                been the ſtewart of Earl Goſpatrick, and oſ Earl Waldeve, not the ſtewart of
                Scotland.</p>
            <p>To the charter by Earl Goſpatrick, there are eight witneſſes: ‘Andrew the
                arch-deacon; Adam his brother; Nigel the chaplain; Ketel the ſon oſ Dolphin; Ernald;
                    <hi rend="italic">Alden the Stewart</hi> (Dapifer); Adam the ſon of Alden; Adam,
                the ſon of Goſpatrick.’ Is it poſſible for credulity itſelf to believe, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alden</hi> placed ſo low in ſuch company, was the <hi
                    rend="italic">high stewart oſ Scotland,</hi> a man at leaſt as honourable as
                Goſpatrick himſelf? I can have no doubt, that the witneſſes to this charter were the
                dependents or houſehold-ſervants of Earl Goſpatrick; and that if we interpret <hi
                    rend="italic">Nigellus Capellanus</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">Nigel the earl's
                    chaplain,</hi> we mult interpret <hi rend="italic">Aldenus Dapiſer</hi> to be
                    <hi rend="italic">Alden the earl's stewart.</hi></p>
            <p>“To the charter granted by Earl Waldeve, there are nine witneſſes. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alden Dapiſer</hi> is the ſeventh in order. There are only three among them who
                ſeem to have been landed men: 'Elias de Hadeſtandena (probably <pb n="775"> </pb>
                Haſſenden), William de Copland, and William de Hellebat (q. Elbottle); all the three
                are placed before <hi rend="italic">Alder Dapiſer.</hi></p>
            <p>“It has been remarked, "That in thoſe days the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >stewart</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dapiſer</hi> was too high a title to be given
                to the retainer of an earl.' I anſwer, that the Saxon Chronicle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >anno</hi> 1093, ſays, ‘Morael of Boebbahurh was thaes eorles stiward,' i.e.
                Morel of Bamborough was this earl’s stewart<hi rend="italic">,</hi> or the ſtewart
                of Robert Earl of Northumberland. Beſides, to a charter granted by Earl Goſpatrick
                the Elder, <hi rend="italic">Lambertus Dapiſer</hi> is a witneſs. If <hi
                    rend="italic">Lambertus Dapiſer</hi>, in a charter of Goſpatrick the Elder,
                implies <hi rend="italic">Lambert the stewart of the family of March,</hi> why
                ſhould <hi rend="italic">Aldenas Dapiſer,</hi> in the charters of the son and
                grandſon of Goſpatrick, imply <hi rend="italic">the stewart of Scotland?</hi></p>
            <p>"I believe that no defender of the common hypotheſis will anſwer this objection, by
                pretending that <hi rend="italic">Lambertus Dapiſer</hi> was indeed stewart <hi
                    rend="italic">of Scotland.</hi> Such an anſwer would leave no room for Walter
                ſtewart of Scotland, who is held to have been a diſtinguiſhed perſonage in the reign
                of Malcolm III.</p>
            <p>“It is curious to see upon what flight grounds our antiquaries have eſtabliſhed the
                connection between <hi rend="italic">Aldenus Dapiſer</hi> and the houſe of Stewart,
                    <hi rend="italic">Walterus filius Alani</hi> appears to have flouriſhed in the
                reign of David I. In the reign of Malcolm IV. he is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dapiſer.</hi> Hence it has been raſhly concluded, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Walterus Dapiſer filius Alani</hi> was the ſon of that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aldenus Dapiſer</hi> who is a witneſs to the charters of Goſpatrick and
                Waldeve.</p>
            <p>“I perſuade myself, that <hi rend="italic">Alden Dapifer,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alen the father oſ Walter</hi> ſtewart of Scotland, in the reign of Malcolm IV.
                were different persons; and that they had nothing in common but the Chriſtian name,
                if indeed they had that in common.</p>
            <p>“Some of my readers may demand, ‘<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> then was Alen, the father
                of Walter, ſtewart of Scotland in the reign of Malcolm IV.?’</p>
            <p>"I can only anſwer this queſtion by demanding, ‘<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> was the
                father of Martach Earl of Marre in the reign of Malcolm III.; of Gilchriſt Earl of
                Angus in the reign of Alexander I.; of Fergus Lord of Galloway in the reign of
                Malcolm IV.; or of Friſkinus de Moravia, anceſtor of the family of Sutherland, in
                the reign of William the Lion? Or, to keep in the ſuppoſed line of the royal family
                of Stewart, '<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> was the father oſ Banquho Thane of
                Loehaber?’</p>
            <p>“Many anſwers may no doubt be made to this laſt queſtion. Kennedy ſays, that the
                father of Banquho was one of the ſeven ſons of Corc king of Munster; Sir George
                M'Kenzie, Of Ferquhard, the ſon of Kenneth III.; and Simpſon, The ſon of Ferquhard
                Thane of Lochaber, the ſon of Kenneth, the ſon of Murdoch, the ſon of Doir, the ſon
                of Eth king of Scotland.</p>
            <p>“It is remarkable, that Abercrombie relates all thoſe contradictory ſtories, without
                ever ſuſpecting the natural inference ariſing from them, ‘That if noble perſons are
                not ſatisfied with a long pedigree, proved by authentic inſtruments, they muſt
                believe in flattering and ignorant fictions; and that if they ſcorn to wait for the
                dawn of record to enlighten their deſcent, they muſt bewilder themſelves in dark and
                fabulous genealogies.’</p>
            <p>“In the reign of David I. before the middle of the 12th century, the family of the
                Stewarts was opulent and powerful. It may therefore have ſubsiſted for many ages
                previous to that time; but when, and what was its commencement, we cannot
                determine."</p>
