<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Association Reports</span><span class="font0"> (seventh meeting). The existence of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">long wave,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wave of translation,</span><span class="font0"> with many of its most important&nbsp;features, was here first recognized, and it was clearly pointed&nbsp;out </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font0"> there is a special rate, depending on the depth of&nbsp;the water, at which a canal-boat can be towed at the least&nbsp;expenditure of effort by the horse. The elementary mathematical theory of the long wave was soon supplied by commentators on Scott Russell's work, and a more complete investigation was subsequently given by Sir G. G. Stokes. Russell&nbsp;indulged in many extraordinary and groundless speculations,&nbsp;some of which were published in a posthumous volume, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Wave of Translation</span><span class="font0"> (1885). His observations led him to&nbsp;propose and experiment on a new system of shaping vessels,&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wave system,</span><span class="font0"> which culminated in the building&nbsp;of the <sup>44</sup> Great Eastern.&quot; His activity and ingenuity were&nbsp;also displayed in many other fields,—steam-coaches for roads,&nbsp;improvements in boilers and in marine engines, the immense&nbsp;iron dome of the Vienna Exhibition, cellular double bottoms&nbsp;for iron ships, &amp;c. With Mr Stafford Northcote (afterwards&nbsp;Lord Iddesleigh), he was joint-secretary of the Great Exhibition of 1851; and he was one of the chief founders of the&nbsp;Institution of Naval Architects. He died at Ventnor on the&nbsp;8th of June 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSELL, THOMAS (1762-1788), English poet,* was born at Beaminster, early in 1762. He was the son of John Russell,&nbsp;an attorney at Bridport, in Dorsetshire, and his mother was&nbsp;Miss Virtue Brickie, of Shaftesbury. He was educated at the&nbsp;grammar school of Bridport, and in 1777 proceeded to Winchester, where he stayed three years, under Dr Joseph Warton,&nbsp;and Thomas Warton, the professor of poetry. In 1780 Russell&nbsp;became a member of New College, Oxford. He graduated&nbsp;B.A. in 1784 and was ordained priest in 1786. During his&nbsp;residence at the university he devoted himself to French,&nbsp;Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Provençal and even German&nbsp;literature. His health, however, broke down, and he retired&nbsp;to Bristol hot wells to drink the waters; but in vain, for he&nbsp;died there on the 31st of July 1788. He was buried in Power-stock churchyard, Dorset. In 1789 was published a thin&nbsp;volume, containing his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sonnets and Miscellaneous Poems,</span><span class="font0"> now a&nbsp;very rare book. It contained twenty-three sonnets, of regular&nbsp;form, and a few paraphrases and original lyrics. The sonnets&nbsp;are the best, and it is by right of these that Russell takes his&nbsp;place as one of the most interesting precursors of the romantic&nbsp;school. <sup>44</sup> War, Love, the Wizard, and the Fay he sung &quot;—&nbsp;in other words, he rejected entirely the narrow circle of subjects&nbsp;laid down for 18th-century poets. In this he was certainly&nbsp;influenced both by Chatterton and by Collins. But he was&nbsp;still more clearly the disciple of Petrarch, of Boccaccio and&nbsp;of Camoens, each of whom he had carefully and enthusiastically&nbsp;studied. His sonnet, <sup>44</sup> Suppos’d to be written at Lemnos/’&nbsp;is his masterpiece, and is unquestionably the greatest English&nbsp;sonnet of the 18th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The anonymous editor of Russell’s solitary volume is said to have been William Howley (1766-1848), long afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, who was a youthful bachelor of New College&nbsp;when Russell, who had been his tutor, died. His memoir of the&nbsp;poet is very perfunctory, and the fullest account of Russell is that&nbsp;published in 1897 by T. Seccombe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSELL, WILLIAM CLARK (1844- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), British author, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">born at the Carlton House Hotel, New York, on the 24th of February 1844, the son of Henry Russell, author of <sup>44</sup> Cheer,&nbsp;Boys, Cheer,&quot; and other popular songs. He went to school&nbsp;at Winchester, and then at Boulogne, joining the merchant&nbsp;service at thirteen, and serving for eight years. This apprenticeship to a seafaring life was turned to account in a series of&nbsp;stories which have fascinated two generations of boy readers.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John Holdsworth, Chief Mate</span><span class="font0"> (1874), immediately made his&nbsp;reputation. Other successful stories were: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Wreck of the&nbsp;Grosvenor</span><span class="font0"> (1875), which he pleaded for better food for&nbsp;English seamen; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Frozen Pirate</span><span class="font0"> (1877), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Ocean Tragedy&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1881), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Emigrant Ship</span><span class="font0"> (1894), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Ship, Her Story</span><span class="font0"> (1894),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Convict Ship</span><span class="font0"> (1895), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Cheer I</span><span class="font0"> (1895), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Captains&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1807), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Romance of a Midshipman</span><span class="font0"> (1898), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Ship’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span><span class="font0"> (1899), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Overdue</span><span class="font0"> (1903), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abandoned</span><span class="font0"> (1904), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">His Island Princess</span><span class="font0"> (1905). He joined the staff of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle Daily&nbsp;Chronicle,</span><span class="font0"> and afterwards became a leader writer on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily&nbsp;Telegraph,</span><span class="font0"> but the double labour of journalism and novelwriting threatened his health, and he resigned in 1887. Many&nbsp;of the papers which he contributed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;collected in volume form in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Round the Galley Fire</span><span class="font0"> and other&nbsp;volumes. He also wrote a Life of Lord Collingwood (1891),&nbsp;and, with W. H. Jacques, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nelson and the Naval Supremacy of&nbsp;England</span><span class="font0"> (New York, 1890).-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSELL, SIR WILLIAM HOWARD (1821-1907), English war correspondent, was bom at Lilyvale, near Tallaght, in&nbsp;the county of Dublin, on the 28th of March 1821, being one&nbsp;of the Russells of Limerick, whose settlement in Ireland&nbsp;dates from the time of Richard II. He entered Trinity College&nbsp;in 1838. Three years later he was thrown very much on his&nbsp;own resources, but a relative, Mr R. W. Russell, who had been&nbsp;sent to Ireland by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Times,</span><span class="font0"> deputed him to report the Irish&nbsp;elections at Longford, and his success definitely turned his&nbsp;attention to journalism. Coming to London in 1842, he went to&nbsp;Cambridge, but left before taking a degree. In the following&nbsp;year he was sent by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span><span class="font0"> to Ireland to report the O'Connell&nbsp;meetings. In 1845 he was appointed to superintend the reports&nbsp;on the Irish railways, and was shortly afterwards sent by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Times</span><span class="font0"> to inspect the O'Connell property in S.W. Ireland, when&nbsp;his plain speaking drew forth a characteristic tirade from the&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> Liberator.&quot; For a short period in 1847 his services were&nbsp;temporarily transferred to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle,</span><span class="font0"> but with&nbsp;that exception he remained permanently connected with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tke&nbsp;Times.</span><span class="font0"> He was sent as special correspondent to Denmark in&nbsp;the war of 1849-50. He did not, however, at once relinquish&nbsp;a legal career, and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple&nbsp;in 1851. On the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853 he went&nbsp;out as special correspondent, and, accompanying the light&nbsp;division to Gallipoli, proceeded with the first detachment to&nbsp;Varna. On the embarkation for the Crimea he was attached&nbsp;to the second division, and landed with it on the 14th of&nbsp;September. He was present at the battle of the Alma on the&nbsp;20th of September, at the investment of Sevastopol, at Balaclava on the 25 th of October and Inkerman on the 5 th of&nbsp;November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Towards the end of May 1855 he accompanied the expedition to Kertch, and did not return to the Crimea until the following&nbsp;August. In September and October he described the attacks&nbsp;on the Malakoff and Redan, the occupation of Sevastopol and&nbsp;the capture of Fort Kinbum. The popularity of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Crimea correspondence led to its republication in two volumes&nbsp;under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The War, 1855-56.</span><span class="font0"> Russell's letters to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Times</span><span class="font0"> were mainly responsible for the enlightenment of the&nbsp;public at home as to the conduct of affairs at the scene of action,&nbsp;and his exposure of the mismanagement during the winter of&nbsp;1854 did more than anything else to cause the downfall of Lord&nbsp;Aberdeen’s ministry. In 1856 Russell was sent to Moscow&nbsp;to describe the coronation of the tsar, and in the following&nbsp;year was attached to the headquarters of Lord Clyde in India.&nbsp;He was present at the siege and capture of Lucknow in 1858,&nbsp;the operations in Oude, the battle of Bareilly and the actions&nbsp;in Rohilkhand, and he received the Indian w’ar medal with the&nbsp;Lucknow clasp. The events of those stirring times are vividly&nbsp;recorded in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">My Diary in India in 1858-59.</span><span class="font0"> Next year he was&nbsp;sent to Italy, but arrived on the eve of the armistice at Villa-franca. On the 7th of January i860 appeared the first number&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Army and Navy Gazette,</span><span class="font0"> which he founded, and of which&nbsp;he was editor and principal proprietor. In 1861 Russell proceeded to Washington, and reached M<sup>4</sup>DowelTs headquarters&nbsp;just before the first battle of Bull Run, and his account of&nbsp;the Federal retreat drew much hostile criticism. He published&nbsp;a full account of the war, in so far as he had ’witnessed it, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">My Diary, North and South, during the Civil War in America,&nbsp;1862.</span><span class="font0"> Returning to England in 1863, he remained at home&nbsp;until 1866, when he proceeded to the headquarters of General&nbsp;Benedek and witnessed the battle of Koniggratz, 3rd of July.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
