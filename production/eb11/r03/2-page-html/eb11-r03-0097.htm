They constitute a genus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Potamochaerus,</span><span class="font1"> nearly allied to the typical pigs of the genus&nbsp;Swi (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Swine),</span><span class="font1"> from which they are distinguishable by the&nbsp;presence in the males of a long horny ridge below the eye;&nbsp;while they are further characterized by their thick coat of&nbsp;bristly and often brightly coloured hair, and by tufts of long&nbsp;bristles at the tips of the elongated and pointed ears.

<p><span class="font1">RIVERS, EARL, an EngUsh title held in succession by the famiUes of Woodville or Wydeville, Darcy and Savage. In&nbsp;1299 John Rivers, or de Ripariis, was summoned to parUament&nbsp;as a baron, and his son John was similarly summoned by&nbsp;Edward II. The earldom was created for Sir Richard Woodville in 1466 and remained in this family until 1491. (For&nbsp;the three earls of his line see below.) As borne by the Wood-villes the title was not derived from the name of a place, but&nbsp;from an ancient family name, Redvers, or Reviers, members of this family, whose arms are quartered on the Rivers shield,&nbsp;having been sometime earls of Devon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From 1626 to his death in 1640 the earldom was held by Thomas Darcy, Viscount Colchester, from whom it descended&nbsp;by special remainder to his grandson John (c. 1610-1654), the&nbsp;son of his daughter EUzabeth (d. 1651) by her marriage with&nbsp;Sir Thomas Savage (d. 1635), who was created Viscount Savage&nbsp;in 1626. John’s son Thomas (c. 1626-1694) <sup>wa</sup>S the 3rd earl,&nbsp;and his grandson Richard the 4th earl (see below). The title&nbsp;became extinct when John, the 5th earl, died about 1735.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A new barony of Rivers, held by the family of Pitt and its later representative, that of Pitt-Rivers, was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1">existence from&nbsp;1776 to 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIVERS, ANTHONY WOODVILLE, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wydeville, 2nd Earl (c.</span><span class="font1"> 1442-1483), statesman and patron of Uterature, and&nbsp;author of the first book printed on EngUsh soil, was born&nbsp;probably in 1442. He was the son of Richard de Wydeville&nbsp;and his wife, Jacquetta de Luxemburg, duchess of Bedford.&nbsp;His father was raised to the peerage in his son’s infancy, and&nbsp;was made earl of Rivers in 1466. Anthony, who was knighted&nbsp;before he became of age, and fought at Towton in 1461,&nbsp;married the daughter of Lord Scales, and became a peer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jure&nbsp;uxoris</span><span class="font1"> in 1462, two years after the death of that nobleman.&nbsp;Being lord of the Isle of Wight at the time, he was in 1467&nbsp;aDDointcd one of the ambassadors to treat with the duke of</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">Burgundy, and he exalted his office by challenging Anthony, comte de la Roche, the bastard of Burgundy, to single fight </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">what was one of the most famous tournaments of the age (see&nbsp;the elaborate narrative in Bentley’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Excerpta Historica,</span><span class="font1"> 176-182). In 1469 Anthony was promoted to be lieutenant of&nbsp;Calais and captain of the king’s armada, while holding other&nbsp;honorary posts. His father and brother were beheaded after&nbsp;the battle of Edgecot, and he succeeded in August of that year&nbsp;to the earldom. He accompanied Edward in his temporary&nbsp;flight to the Continent, and on his return to England had a share&nbsp;in the victory of Barnet and Tewkesbury and defended London&nbsp;from the Lancastrians. In 1473 he became guardian and&nbsp;governor to the young prince of Wales, and for the next few&nbsp;years there was no man in England of greater responsibiUty&nbsp;or enjoying more considerable honours in the royal service.&nbsp;It is now that for the first time we become aware of Lord&nbsp;Rivers’s literary occupations. His mother, the duchess, died&nbsp;in 1472, and his first wife in 1473; in 1475 and the following&nbsp;year he went on pilgrimage to the holy places of Italy; from&nbsp;this time forth there was a strong tincture of serious reflection&nbsp;thrown over his character; he was now, as we Ieam from Caxton,&nbsp;nominated “ Defender and Director of the Siege Apostolic for&nbsp;the Pope in England.” Caxton had in 1476 rented a shop in&nbsp;the Sanctuary at Westminster, and here had set up a printing-press. The first MS. which he undertook in London was one&nbsp;sent to him by “ the noble and puissant lord, Lord Antone,&nbsp;Erie of Ryvyers,” consisting of a translation “ into right good&nbsp;and fayr EngIyssh ” of Jean de Teonvflle’s French version of&nbsp;a Latin work, “ a glorious fair mirror to all good Christian&nbsp;people.” In 1477 Caxton brought out this book, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictes&nbsp;and Sayengis of the Philosophers,</span><span class="font1"> and it is illustrious as the first&nbsp;production of an English printing-press. To this succeeded&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moral Proverbs</span><span class="font1"> of Christine de Pisan, in verse, in 1478, and&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cordial,</span><span class="font1"> in prose, in 1479. The original productions of Lord&nbsp;Rivers, and, in particular, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Balades against the Seven Deadly&nbsp;Sins,</span><span class="font1"> are lost. In 1478 a marriage was arranged between him&nbsp;and Margaret, sister of King James IIL of Scotland, but it&nbsp;was mysteriously broken off. Rivers began to perceive that&nbsp;it was possible to rise too high for the safety of a subject, and&nbsp;he is now described to us as one who “ conceiveth well the&nbsp;mutabiUty and the unstableness of this life.” After the death&nbsp;of Edward IV., he became the object of Richard III.’s pecuUar&nbsp;enmity, and was beheaded by his orders at Pontefract on the&nbsp;25th of June 1483. He was succeeded by his brother Richard,&nbsp;the 3rd and last earl of the WydeviUe family, who died in&nbsp;1491. Lord Rivers is spoken of by Commines as “ un très-gentil chevaUer,” and by Sir Thomas More as “ a right honourable man, as valiant of hand as poUtic in counsel.” His&nbsp;protection and encouragement of Caxton were of inestimable&nbsp;value .to English literature, and in the preface to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the printer gives an account of his own relations with the&nbsp;statesman which Ulustrates the dignity and modesty of Lord&nbsp;Rivers in a very agreeable way. Rivers was one of the purest&nbsp;writers of English prose of his time.</span></p>

Early in Ufe Richard Savage acquired notoriety&nbsp;by his dare-devilry and dissipation, and he was, too, one of&nbsp;the most conspicuous rakes in the society of the period.&nbsp;After becoming Lord Colchester on his brother’s death he&nbsp;entered parliament as member for Wigan in 1681 and procured&nbsp;a commission in the Horseguards under Sarsfield in 1686.&nbsp;He was “ the first nobleman and one of the first persons ”&nbsp;who joined the prince of Orange on his landing in England,&nbsp;and he accompanied William to London. Obtaining promotion in the army, he served with distinction in Ireland and in&nbsp;the Netherlands, and was made major-general in 1693 and</span></p>
