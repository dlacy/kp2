<p><span class="font1">but this preliminary is by no means a condition precedent to the exercise of the common-law powers of suppressing riots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The crown cannot charge upon the local rates the expense of maintaining soldiers called into a district by the magistrates&nbsp;to suppress a riot </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{re</span><span class="font1"> Glamorgan County Council, L.R. 1899,&nbsp;2 Q.B. 536); but the cost of extra police drafted in for the&nbsp;like purpose falls on the rates of the district into which they&nbsp;are drafted (see Police Act 1890, s. 25). Until 1886 persons&nbsp;whose property was damaged by riot had a civil remedy of&nbsp;an exceptional character by action against the hundred in&nbsp;which the riot took place. This remedy was a survival of&nbsp;the pre-Conquest liability of the hundred to guarantee the&nbsp;orderly conduct of its inhabitants. The hundred was made&nbsp;liable in case of robbery by the Statute of Winchester (1285).@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup> That and subsequent acts were repealed in the reign of George&nbsp;IV., and their provisions were consolidated by an act of 1827&nbsp;which gave a remedy against the hundred in the case of&nbsp;felonious demolition of churches, chapels, houses, machinery,&nbsp;&amp;c., being feloniously demolished by rioters. The last instance&nbsp;of the use of this exceptional remedy was in the case of a riot&nbsp;at Worthing, and the remedy was abolished in 1886. AVhen the&nbsp;Piccadilly riots occurred in that year no one knew that the&nbsp;injured shops were in the hundred of Ossulston, and difficulties&nbsp;arose in applying the old procedure. So an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span><span class="font1"> statute&nbsp;was passed îthe Metropolitan Police Compensation Act 1886)&nbsp;for a special settlement of the claims, and the old statutes&nbsp;were repealed and replaced by the Riot Damage Act 1886.&nbsp;Under this act compensation is payable where rioters have&nbsp;injured or destroyed houses, shops, buildings, fixed or movable&nbsp;machinery and appliances prepared or used for or in connexion&nbsp;with manufactures or agriculture, or for mines or quarries, or&nbsp;vessels stranded or in distress (see Wreck), or have injured,&nbsp;stolen, or destroyed property in houses, shops or buildings.&nbsp;The compensation is payable out of the police rate for the&nbsp;district in which the damage is done; or if it was done afloat,&nbsp;for the district nearest to the scene of action. The claim is&nbsp;made on the police authority for the district. The time and&nbsp;form for making claims and the mode of fixing the amount&nbsp;of compensation is regulated by rules made by the Home&nbsp;Secretary on the 30th of June 1894 (Stat. R. and O. 1894,&nbsp;No. 636). In adjusting the amount regard is had to the conduct&nbsp;of the claimant, viz. as to precautions taken by him, his share,&nbsp;if any, in the riot, or provocation offered to the rioters.&nbsp;Failure to carry out a programme for athletic sports has been&nbsp;held to debar a claimant from compensation for damage done&nbsp;by a riot among the disappointed spectators who had paid to&nbsp;see the sports. The claimant must give credit for insurance&nbsp;money, or any other compensation received in respect of the&nbsp;damage; but the insurers or persons who paid such compensation may file a claim against the police rate for the&nbsp;amount paid by them. Persons dissatisfied with the award&nbsp;of the police authority may sue for the recovery of their claim&nbsp;subject to a Iiability to pay all the costs if they do not get&nbsp;judgment for more than the amount awarded. The action,&nbsp;if it is not for more than £100, is to be brought in the county&nbsp;court. The remedy is available in the case of stranded ships&nbsp;plundered by rioters (s. 515 of the Merchant Shipping Act&nbsp;1894).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Riot Act does not extend to Ireland, but similar provisions are contained in an act of the Irish Parliament passed&nbsp;in 1787 as amended by acts of 1831 and 1842. These acts&nbsp;create a special offence punishable by penal servitude for life,&nbsp;viz. sending notices, letters or messages inciting or tending&nbsp;to riot. Under the Criminal Procedure Ireland Act 1887&nbsp;(a temporary act) summary proceedings may be taken against&nbsp;rioters. The civil remedy against the county or borough&nbsp;for malicious injury to property, real or personal, including&nbsp;ships in distress and their cargo, is wider than in England or&nbsp;Scotland, but it includes malicious injury by rioters where&nbsp;the injury is a crime within the Malicious Damage Act of 1861.&nbsp;Claims arenow dealt with in the county court, and notas formerly&nbsp;by the grand jury and judge of assize (Local Government&nbsp;Ireland Act 1898, s. 5).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> There is a curious exception still on the Statute-book depriving persons robbed while travelling on the Lord’s Day of any right to&nbsp;compensation from the hundred (Lord’s Day Act 1677, s. 5).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">In Scotland a riot may be either “ rioting and mobbing ” or “ rioting and breach of the peace.” The first is much the&nbsp;same as riot in English law. Mobbing consists in the assembling&nbsp;of a number of people and then combining against order or&nbsp;peace to the alarm of the lieges (Alison, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cr, Law of Scotland<sub>i&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font1">vol. i. p. 509; Macdonald, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Law,</span><span class="font1"> 180). The second&nbsp;offence occurs when concourse or a common purpose arc&nbsp;wanting. Numerous acts against rioting and unlawful convocation were passed by the Scottish parliament, beginning in 1487.&nbsp;The Riot Act (1716) applies to Scotland. There is a civil&nbsp;remedy against the county or burgh in which a riot takes&nbsp;place in respect of damage done by the rioters to houses,&nbsp;churches, buildings and ships, and buildings or engines used&nbsp;in trade or manufacture. The remedy is given by a scries of&nbsp;statutes of 1716, 1812, 1816, 1817 and 1894. The procedure&nbsp;for its enforcement is now regulated by the Riotous Assemblies&nbsp;(Scotland) Act 1822, and amending statutes. The county&nbsp;or burgh authorities may adjust claims without litigation,&nbsp;and pay them out of the general assessments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">British Dominions.—</span><span class="font1">In India the offence of riot, as defined by s. 146 of the Penal Code, consists in the use of force or&nbsp;violence by an unlawful assembly (which must consist of at&nbsp;least five persons, s. 141), or by any member thereof in the&nbsp;prosecution of the common object of such assembly (see Mayne,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ind. Criminal Law,</span><span class="font1"> ed. 1896, p. 489). In Ceylon and the&nbsp;Straits Settlements provisions based on the Indian Code are&nbsp;in force. In most of the settled Colonies the English law as to&nbsp;riot applies subject to local legislation. The Criminal Codes&nbsp;of Canada (1892, ss. 79-86), New Zealand (1893, ss. 83-89)&nbsp;and Queensland (1899, ss. 61-67) adopt the substance of the&nbsp;English law as to riot, in terms borrowed from the English&nbsp;draft Code of 1880. In those of the West Indies whose common&nbsp;law is based on that of France, Holland or Spain, the English&nbsp;law as to riot has been applied by ordinance, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in British&nbsp;Guiana (Criminal Code 1893, tit. xix),' and St Lucia (CriminaI&nbsp;Code 1888, tit. xxv). In the South African colonics the English&nbsp;law of riot does not apply, but under the Dutch Roman law&nbsp;there exists a similar offence, known as “ public violence ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{vis publica), i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the use of violence and force by which the&nbsp;public rest and order is endangered and the authority of the&nbsp;lawful authorities and officials is set at naught. The offence&nbsp;was capital (see Van Leeuwen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman-Dutch Law,</span><span class="font1"> tr. by Kotze,&nbsp;1886, vol. ii. p. 294; Morice, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">English and Roman-Dzdch Law,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1903, p. 334). Similar provisions based on the French Penal&nbsp;Code are in force in Mauritius (Penal Code of 1838).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">United States.—</span><span class="font1">In the United States the law is based upon that of England (see Bishop, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Cr. L.,</span><span class="font1"> 8th ed., 1892,&nbsp;vol. i. s. 534, vol. ii. ss. 1143 et seq.). In some states there&nbsp;is a statutory proclamation for the dispersion of rioters in terms&nbsp;almost identical with those of the British Riot Act. The&nbsp;city, town, or county is by the statutes of many states&nbsp;rendered liable for damage caused by rioters, with or without&nbsp;a remedy over against the persons who did the damage (see&nbsp;revised Laws of Massachusetts, ed. 1902, chap. 211, sects. 2, 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RIO TINTO </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Minas de Rio Tinto), a mining town of southwestern Spain, in the province of Huelva; near the source of the river Tinto, and at the terminus of a light railway from the&nbsp;port of Huelva. Pop. (1900) 11,603. Ri</span><span class="font1"><sup>o</sup> Tinto is one of the&nbsp;greatest copper-mining centres in the world; and it is from the&nbsp;discoloration of its waters by copper ore that the river derives&nbsp;its name. Besides the town of Minas, several villages are peopled&nbsp;by the native miners, whose numbers exceed 10,000; and one is&nbsp;occupied solely by British mine officials. The surrounding&nbsp;country is covered for miles with heaps of slag, and has been&nbsp;reduced to a desert. In 1903 the output of the mines included&nbsp;840,000 tons of copper ore, worth more than £500,000, besides&nbsp;a relatively small quantity of iron and manganese. Almost the&nbsp;entire product is despatched to Huelva for shipment to Great</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
