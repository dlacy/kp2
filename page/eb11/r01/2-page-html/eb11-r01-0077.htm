<p><span class="font1">on which the engines stand to afford easy access for the inspection and cleaning of their mechanism. Machine shops are usually provided to enable minor repairs to be executed; the&nbsp;tendency, both in England and America, is to increase the&nbsp;amount of such repairing plant at engine sheds, thus lengthening&nbsp;the intervals between the visits of the engines to the main&nbsp;repairing shops of the railway. A locomotive depot further&nbsp;includes stores of the various materials required in working&nbsp;the engines, coal stages at which they are loaded with coal,&nbsp;and an ample supply of water. The quality of the last is a&nbsp;matter of great importance; when it is unsuitable, the boilers&nbsp;will suffer, and the installation of a water-softening plant may&nbsp;save more in the expenses of boiler maintenance than it costs&nbsp;to operate. The water cranes or towers which are placed at&nbsp;intervals along the railway to supply the engines with water&nbsp;require similar care in regard to the quality of the water laid&nbsp;on to them, as also to the water troughs, or track tanks as they&nbsp;are called in America, by which engines are able to pick up&nbsp;water without stopping. These consist of shallow troughs&nbsp;about 18 in. wide, placed between the rails on perfectly level&nbsp;stretches of line. When water is required, a scoop is lowered&nbsp;into them from below the engine, and if the speed is sufficient&nbsp;the water is forced up it into the tender-tanks. Such troughs&nbsp;were first employed on the London &amp; North-Western railway&nbsp;in 1857 by John Ramsbottom, and have since been adopted on&nbsp;many other lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Goods stations vary in size from those which consist of perhaps a single siding, to those which have accommodation&nbsp;for thousands of wagons. At a small roadside station,&nbsp;where the traffic is of a purely local character, there&nbsp;will be some sidings to which horses and carts have&nbsp;access for handling bulk goods like coal, gravel, manure, &amp;c.,&nbsp;and a covered shed for loading and unloading packages and&nbsp;materials which it is undesirable to expose to the weather. The&nbsp;shed may have a single pair of rails for wagons running through&nbsp;it along one side of a raised platform, there being a roadway for&nbsp;carts on the other side; or if more accommodation is required&nbsp;there may be two tracks, one on each side of the platform, which&nbsp;is then approached by carts at the end. In either case the&nbsp;platform is fitted with a crane or cranes for lifting merchandise&nbsp;into and out of the wagons, and doors enable the shed to be&nbsp;used as a lock-up warehouse. In a large station the arrangements become much more complicated, the precise design being&nbsp;governed by the nature of the traffic that has to be served and by&nbsp;the physical configuration of the site. It is generally convenient&nbsp;to keep the inwards and the outwards traffic distinct and to deal&nbsp;with the two classes separately; at junction stations it may also&nbsp;be necessary to provide for the transfer of freight from one wagon&nbsp;to another, though the bulk of goods traffic is conveyed through&nbsp;to its destination in the wagons into which it was originally&nbsp;loaded. The increased loading space required in the sheds is&nbsp;obtained by multiplying the number and the length of lines&nbsp;and platforms; sometimes also there are short sidings, cut into&nbsp;the platforms at right angles to the lines, in which wagons are&nbsp;placed by the aid of wagon turn-tables, and sometimes the wagons&nbsp;are dealt with on two floors, being raised or lowered bodily&nbsp;from the ground level by lifts. The higher floors commonly&nbsp;form warehouses where traders may store goods which have&nbsp;arrived or are awaiting despatch. An elaborate organization&nbsp;is required to keep a complete check and record of all the&nbsp;goods entering and leaving the station, to ensure that they are&nbsp;loaded into the proper wagons according to their destination,&nbsp;that they are unloaded and sorted in such a way that they can&nbsp;be delivered to their consignees with the least possible delay,&nbsp;that they are not stolen or accidentally mislaid, &amp;c.; and&nbsp;accommodation must be provided for a large. clerical and&nbsp;supervisory staff to attend to these matters. British rail-ways also undertake the collection and delivery of freight, in&nbsp;addition to transporting it, and thus an extensive range of&nbsp;vans and wagons, whether drawn by horses or mechanically&nbsp;propelled, must be provided in connexion with an important</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shunting Yards, —</span><span class="font1">It may happen that from a large station sufficient traffic may be consigned to certain other large&nbsp;stations to enable full train-loads to be made up daily, or several&nbsp;times a day, and despatched direct to their destinations. In&nbsp;general, however, the conditions are less simple. Though a&nbsp;busy colliery may send off its product by the train-load to&nbsp;an important town, the wagons will usually be addressed to a&nbsp;number of different consignees at different depots in different&nbsp;parts of the town, and therefore the train will have to be broken&nbsp;up somewhere short of its destination and its trucks rearranged,&nbsp;together with those of other trains similarly constituted, into&nbsp;fresh trains for conveyance to the various depots. Again, a&nbsp;station of moderate size may collect goods destined for a great&nbsp;variety of places but not in sufficient quantities to compose a&nbsp;full train-load for any of them, and then it becomes impossible,&nbsp;except at the cost of uneconomical working, to avoid despatching&nbsp;trains which contain wagons intended for many diverse destinations&nbsp;. For some distance these wagons will all travel over the&nbsp;same line, but sooner or later they will reach a junction-point&nbsp;where their ways will diverge and where they must be separated.&nbsp;At this point trains of wagons similarly destined for different&nbsp;places will be arriving from other lines, and hence the necessity&nbsp;will arise of collecting together from all the trains all the wagons&nbsp;which are travelling to the same place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The problem may be illustrated diagrammatically as follows (fig. 15): A may be supposed to be a junction outside a large&nbsp;seaport where branches from docks </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b, c</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> converge, and&nbsp;where the main line also divides into three, going to B, C and D&nbsp;respectively. A train from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> will contain some wagons for B,&nbsp;some for C and some for D, as will also the trains from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b, c</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font0"> At A therefore it becomes necessary to disentangle and group&nbsp;together all the wagons that are intended for B, all that are intended&nbsp;for C, and all that are intended for D. Even that is not the whole&nbsp;of the problem. Between A and B, A and C, and A and D, there&nbsp;may be a string of stations, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p, q, r, s,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c., all receiving goods from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a, b, c</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> and it would manifestly be inconvenient and wasteful&nbsp;of time and trouble if the trains serving those intermediate stations&nbsp;were made up with, say, six wagons from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> next the engine, five&nbsp;from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> at the middle, and four from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0"> near the end. Hence&nbsp;at A the trucks from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> must not only be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sorted</span><span class="font0"> according&nbsp;as they have to travel along A B, A C, or A D, but also must be&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">marshalled</span><span class="font0"> into trains in the order of the stations along those lines. Conversely, trains. arriving at A from B, C and D must be broken up&nbsp;and remade in order to distribute their wagons to the different&nbsp;dock branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To enable the wagons to be shunted into the desired order yards containing a large number of sidings are constructed at important&nbsp;junction points like A. Such a yard consists essentially of a group&nbsp;or groups of sidings, equal in length at least to the longest train run&nbsp;on the line, branching out from a single main track and often again&nbsp;converging to a single track at the other end; the precise design,&nbsp;however, varies with the amount and character of the work that&nbsp;has to be done, with the configuration of the ground, and also with&nbsp;the mode of shunting adopted. The oldest and commonest method&nbsp;of shunting is that known as “ push-and-pull, ” or in America as&nbsp;“ link-and-pin ” or “ tail ” shunting. An engine coupled to a batch&nbsp;of wagons runs one or more of them down one siding, leaves them&nbsp;there, then returns back with the remainder clear of the points&nbsp;where the sidings diverge, runs one or more others down another&nbsp;siding, and so on till they are all disposed of. The same operation&nbsp;is repeated with fresh batches of wagons, until the sidings contain&nbsp;a number of trains, each intended, it may be supposed, for a particular&nbsp;town or district. In some cases nothing more is required than to&nbsp;attach an engine and brake-van (“ caboose ”) and despatch the&nbsp;train; but if, as will happen in others, a further rearrangement of</span></p>
