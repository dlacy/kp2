Superficies are either rectilinear, curvilinear, plane, concave, or convex. A rectilinear ſuperficies is that which is bounded by right lines.

cies is bounded by curve lines. Plane ſuperficies is that which has no inequality in it, nor riſings, nor ſinkings, but lies evenly and ſtraight throughout, ſo that a right line may wholly coincide with it in all parts and directions. Convex ſuperficies is that which is curved and riſes outwards. Concave ſuperficies is curved and sinks inward. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
