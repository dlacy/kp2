                on the rostra (this part is broken), while in front a crowd&nbsp;of citizens are
                bringing tablets and piling them in a heap to be&nbsp;burnt. This records the
                remission by Trajan of some arrears of&nbsp;debt due to the imperial treasury
                (Spartian, 7). The background&nbsp;here represents again the Basilica Julia, with
                (on the right) the&nbsp;Ionic temple of Saturn and the Corinthian temple of
                Vespasian.&nbsp;Between them is an arch, which may be that of Tiberius. On
                the&nbsp;left the fig-tree and the statue of Marsyas are repeated.
                Other&nbsp;explanations of these reliefs have been given, but the above
                appears&nbsp;the most probable.@@<sup>1</sup> Towards the other end of the Forum are
                remains of a large concrete pedestal. This is usually called the&nbsp;base of the
                equestrian statue of Domitian (Statius, </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Silv.,</span><span class="font2"> i. 22),&nbsp;which
                stood in front of the Ædes Julii ; but its brick facing shows&nbsp;that it is much
                later than Domitian’s time, and, moreover, Domitian’s statue was destroyed
                immediately after his death.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The seven cubical brick and concrete structures, once faced with
                marble, which line the Sacra Via, are not earlier than the time
                    of&nbsp;Constantine.@@<sup>2</sup> They are probably the pedestals of honorary
                columns,&nbsp;such as those shown in the relief on Constantine’s arch,
                mentioned&nbsp;above. The column erected in honour of the tyrant Phocas
                by&nbsp;Smaragdus in the eleventh year of his exarchate (608) is
                still&nbsp;standing. It is a fine marble Corinthian column, stolen from&nbsp;some
                earlier building ; it stands on rude steps of marble and tufa.&nbsp;The name of
                Phocas is erased from the inscription ; but the date&nbsp;shows that this monument
                was to his honour. Remains of other&nbsp;small marble structures are shown in Plate
                VII., but what they are&nbsp;is not known. In the 4th century a long brick and
                concrete building faced with marble was built along the whole south-east end
                of&nbsp;the Forum, probably a row of shops. They were destroyed by&nbsp;Comm. Rosa’s
                order a few years ago. Countless fragments of other&nbsp;buildings, reliefs, and
                statues are strewn all over the Forum. Many&nbsp;of these are of great interest ;
                pieces of large granite columns&nbsp;which probably stood on the seven pedestals
                mentioned above are&nbsp;lying in various places ; some of these appear to have been
                decorated with bronze reliefs, the iron fastenings of which, run with&nbsp;lead,
                still exist.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">In addition to the walls of Roma Quadrata (see above), a few remains
                only now exist earlier in date than the later years of the&nbsp;republic; these are
                mostly grouped near the Scalæ Caci (see No.&nbsp;11 in fig. 17) and consist of small
                cellæ and other structures of unknown use.@@<sup>4</sup> They are partly built of
                the soft tufa used in the&nbsp;wall of Romulus and partly of the hard tufa which
                resembles&nbsp;peperino. Various names, such as the “hut of Faustulus” and&nbsp;the
                “ Auguratorium,” have been given to these very ancient remains,&nbsp;but with little
                reason. One thing is certain, that the buildings&nbsp;ιvere respected and preserved
                even under the empire and were&nbsp;probably regarded as sacred relics of the
                earliest times. Remains&nbsp;of more than one temple, probably of the early
                republican period,&nbsp;exist near this ιvest angle of the Palatine ; these had
                peristyles&nbsp;with Tuscan columns of tufa stuccoed and painted. The larger
                of&nbsp;these (see 14 in fig. 17) has been called Conjecturally the temple
                of&nbsp;Jupiter Victor (Liv., x. 29 ; Ov., </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Fast.,</span><span class="font2"> iv. 621). It stands on
                a&nbsp;levelled platform of tufa rock, the Ioiver part of which is
                excavated&nbsp;into quarry chambers, used in later times as water reservoirs.
                Two&nbsp;ancient ιvell-shafts lined ιvith tufa communicate ιvith these subterranean
                IioIIoavs. Another extensive building of hard tufa of&nbsp;the republican period
                exists in the valley afterwards covered by&nbsp;the Flavian palace ; part of this
                can be seen under the so-called&nbsp;Accademia (21 in fig. 17). Not far from the top
                of the Scalæ Caci&nbsp;are the massive remains of some large cella, nothing of which
                noιv&nbsp;exists except the concrete core made of alternate layers of tufa
                and</span></p>

                colossal seated figure of a goddess ιvas found, in Greek marble,
                ιvell&nbsp;modelled, a ιvork of the 1st century a.d. The head and arms
                are&nbsp;missing, but the figure is probably rightly called a statue of&nbsp;Cybele
                ; and from it her name has been Conjecturally given to this&nbsp;temple. Augustus in

                is more probable&nbsp;that his temple to Cybele formed part of the magnificent group
                of&nbsp;buildings in the area of Apollo (see below). Some interesting
            early</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">architectural fragments are lying near this temple ; they consist of
                drums and capitals of Corinthian columns, and part of the cornice&nbsp;of the
                pediment, cut in peperino, and thickly coated with hard&nbsp;white stucco to imitate
                marble. Betiveen this and the temple (so&nbsp;called) of Jupiter Victor are
                extensive remains of a large sort of&nbsp;porticus, with tufa Avails and travertine
                piers, also republican in&nbsp;date. The use and name of this building are unknown.
                The&nbsp;temple of Jupiter Stator, traditionally voιved by Romulus during&nbsp;his
                repulse by the Sabines (Liv., i. 12), stood near the Porta&nbsp;Mugionis, and
                therefore near the road leading up to the Palatine&nbsp;Sacra A ia.@@<sup>5
                </sup>This has been identified with the ruined concrete&nbsp;podium (40 in fig. 17),
                the position of which suits the above indications ; but the admixture of travertine,
                brick, and even marble&nbsp;with the tufa of the concrete shoιvs that no trace here
                remains of&nbsp;any early building. On the tufa blocks of a shaft leading
                down&nbsp;to a large drain by the side of these remains are incised in
                large&nbsp;letters—</span></p>

                3d century B. c.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Remains of extensive lines of buildings in early opus reticulatum
                exist on the upper slopes of the Palatine, all along the Velabrum&nbsp;side, and on
                the south-west side as far as the so-called Domus&nbsp;Gelotiana. These buildings
                are constructed on the ruins of the&nbsp;Avail of Romulus, a great part of which has
                been cut away to make&nbsp;room for them ; their base is at the foot of the ancient
                wall, on the&nbsp;shelf cut midway in the side of the hill ; their top reached
                originally&nbsp;above the upper level of the summit. They are of various
                dates&nbsp;and cannot be identified with any known buildings. Part is apparently of
                the time of the emperor Tiberius, and no doubt belongs&nbsp;to the Domus Tiberiana

                this palace covered a great part&nbsp;of the Avest corner of the hill. Of about the
                same date is a very&nbsp;interesting and well-preserved private house built wholly
                of opus&nbsp;reticulatum ; it is usually called the house of Livia. It has
                a&nbsp;small atrium, out of which open the triclinium and the tablinum&nbsp;with a
                room (α∕α) on each side, all handsomely decorated with good&nbsp;paintings of
                mythological and domestic scenes, probably the work&nbsp;of Greek artists, as
                inscriptions in Greek occur,—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >c.g.</span><span class="font1">, EPMHC,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">under the
                figure of Hermes, in a picture representing his deliverance of Io from
                    Argus.@@<sup>6</sup> The back part of this house was three&nbsp;stories high,
                and is divided into a great number of very small&nbsp;rooms, mostly bedrooms. The
                house is built in a sort of hole&nbsp;against the side of an elevation, so that the
                upper floor behind is&nbsp;level with an ancient paved road. The dampness caused by
                this&nbsp;is counteracted and kept off the paintings by a lining of
                flange-tiles&nbsp;over the external Avails, under the stucco, thus forming an
                air-cavity all over the surface. From the back of the house, at the&nbsp;upper
                level, a long subterranean passage leads towards the Flavian&nbsp;palace, and then,
                turning at right angles and passing by the&nbsp;foundations of the so-called temple
                of Jupiter Victor, issues in the&nbsp;ancient tufa building mentioned above (20 in
                fig. 17). Another&nbsp;crypto-porticus starts near this house and communicates with
                the&nbsp;long semi-subterranean passage by which the palaces of Caligula&nbsp;and
                Domitian are connected (19 in fig. 17). It is ornamented with&nbsp;very beautiful
                stucco reliefs of cupids, beasts, and foliage, once&nbsp;painted and gilt. This
                private house is probably that of Germani-cus, into which the soldiers who killed
                Caligula in the long crypto-porticus escaped, as described by Josephus </span><span

                a great portion of the central part of the Palatine (see 47 and 48 in fig.&nbsp;17)

                silver, ivory, bronze, and marble, mostly the production of the best Greek artists,

                the&nbsp;Summa Sacra Via along the line of the present Via di S. Bonaven-tura ; the
