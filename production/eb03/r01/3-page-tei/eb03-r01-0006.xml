He was educated at oxford, and enrolled himſelf upon the phyfical line; but it was re-markable that he recommended himſelf more by his ready wit and vivacity, than by any extraordinary ac-qniſitions in learning. He began to practiſe at oxford in 1675; but never paid any regard to eſtabliſhed rules, which he cenfured whenever he thought fit, with great freedom and acrimony ; and as this drew all the old ,<hi rend="sub">w</hi>  practitioners upon him, he lived in a continual ſtate of hoſtility with them. Nevertheleſs, his reputation in-creaſed with his experience; ſo that, before he had been two years in buſinefs, his practice was very extenſive among perfons of high rank. In 1684 he removed to London, and fettled in Bow-ſtreet, Covent Garden, where in leſs than a year he got into prime buſineſs. — In 1687 the princeſs Anne of Denmark made him her phyſician : yet when her huſhand and ſhe joined the prince of orange, Radcliffe, either not chooſing to declare himſelf, or unwilling to favour the meafures then in agitation, excufed himſelf from attending them, on the plea of the multitude of his patients. Nevertheleſs, he was often ſent for to King william and other great perfonages, though he did not incline to be a courtier. He incurred ſome cenſure for his treatment of Q^Mary, who died of the finall-pox ; and ſoon aſter loſt his place about the princeſs Anne, by his attachment to his bottle. He alſo totally loſt the favour of K. william by his un-courtly freedom ; for, in 1699, when the king ſhowed</p><p>him his ſwollen ankles, while the reſt of his body was emaciated, and aſked him what he thought of them ? " why truly I would not have your majeſty’s two legs for your three kingdoms,” replied Radcliffe. He continued increafing in buſineſs and inſolence as long as he lived, continually at war with his brethren the phyſi-cians ; who conſidered him in no other light than that of an act ive ingenious empiric, whom conſtant practice had at ∖ ngth brought to ſome degree of ſkill in his profeffi<hi rend="sup">c</hi>⅛. He died in 1714; and if he never attempt-• td to wrſte any thing himſelf, has perpetuated hie me-mory by founding a fine libraryat Oxford, to preſerve the writings of other men.</p><p>RADIALIS, the name of two muſcles in the arm.

It is a poor little place, diſtant from London about 150 miles. It is ſituated near the ſpring-head of the river Somergil, in a fruitful valley at the bottom of a hill, where there are ſheep grazing in abundance. It is a very ancient borough-town, whoſe juriſdiction extends near 12 miles round about : the go-vernment of it is veſted in a bailiff and 25 burgeſſes. Though it is the county-town, the affizes are held at Preſteign: it has one privilege, however, that is very extraordinary, beſides that of fending one member to par-liament ; and that is, it keeps a court of pleas for all actions, without being limited to any particular ſum.. It was formerly fenced with a wall and a ſtrong caſtle ⅛ but both were in a great meaſure demoliſhed by ûwen Gleπdower, when he aſſumed the title of Prince of wales, upon the depoſition of King Richard II.

This county is divided into ſix hundreds, in which are contained three market-towns, 52 pariſhes, about 3 j 60 houſes, and 18,960 inhabitants. It is ſeat-ed in the dioceſe of Hereford, and fends two members to parliament, one for the county and one for the town of Radnor. The air of this county is in winter cold and piercing. The foil in general is but indifferent j yet ſome places produce corn, particularly the eaſtern and fouthern parts ; but in the northern and weſtern, which are mountainous, the land is chiefly ſtocked with homed cattle, ſheep, and goats.</p><p>RADIX.
