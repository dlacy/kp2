an exercise on ice, both graceful and healthy. Although the ancients were remarkable for their dexterity in most, of the athletic sports, yet skating seems to have been unknown to them. It may therefore be considered as a modern invention ; and probably it derived its origin in Holland, where it was practised not only as a graceful and elegant amusement, but as an expeditious mode of travelling when the lakes and canals were frozen up during winter. In Holland long journeys are made upon skates, with ease and expedition ; but in general less attention is there paid to graceful and elegant movements, than to the expedition and celerity of what is called journey skating. It is only in those countries where it is considered as an amusement, that its graceful attitudes and movements can be studied ; and there is no exercise whatever better calculated to set off the human figure to advantage. The acquirement of most exercises may be attained at an advanced period of life ; but to become an expert skater, it is necessary to begin the practice of the art at a very early age. It is difficult to reduce the art of skating to a system. It is principally by the imitation of a good skater that a young practitioner can form his own practice. The English, though often remarkable for feats of agility upon skates, are very deficient in gracefulness, which is partly owing to the construction of the skates. They are too much curved in the surface which embraces the ice ; consequently they involuntarily bring the users of them round on the outside upon a quick and small circle ; whereas the skater, by using skates of a different construction, viz. less curved, has the command of his stroke, and can enlarge or diminish the circle according to his own wish and desire. The metropolis of Scotland has produced more instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other country whatever ; and the institution of a skating club has contributed not a little to the improvement of this elegant amusement.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
