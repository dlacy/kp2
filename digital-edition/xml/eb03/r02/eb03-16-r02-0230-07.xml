<p>ture, long narrow flexible pieces of timber, nailed upon the outſade of the ribs, from the item to the ftern-∙ poſt, ſo as to envelope the ſhip lengthwiſe, and appear on her ſide and bottom like the meridians on the ſur-face of the globe. The ribands being judiciouſly arranged with regard to their height and diſtance from each other, and forming regular ſweeps about the ſhip’s body, will compoſe a kind of frame, whoſe interior ſur-face will determine the curve of all the intermediate or filling-timbers which are ſtationed between the principal ones. As the figure of the ſhip’s bottom approaches to that of a conoid, and the ribands have a limited breadth, it is apparent that they cannot be applied to this convex ſurface without forming a double curve, which will be partly vertical and partly horizontal ; ſo that the vertical curve will increaſe by approaching the ſtem, and ſtill more by drawing near the iiern-poſt. It is alſo evident, that by deviating from the middle line of the ſhip’s length, as they approach the extreme breadth at the midſhip-frame, the ribands will alſo form an horizontal curve. The loweſt of theſe, which is termined upon the ſtem and ſtern-poſt, at the height of the riſing-line of the floor, and anſwers to the upper part of the floor-timber upon the midſhip-frame, is called the <hi rend="italic">floor-riband.</hi> That which coincides with the wing-tranſom, at the height of the lower-deck upon the midſhip-frame, is termed the <hi rend="italic">breadth riband ;</hi> all the reſt, which are placed between theſe two, are called <hi rend="italic">intermediate ribands.</hi> See Ship-building.</p>
