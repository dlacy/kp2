the general diſpoſition of the ſeveral materials contained in a ſhip’s hold, with regard to their figure, magnitude, or ſolidity.</p><p>In the ſtowage of different articles, as ballaſt, caſks, caſes, bales, and boxes, there are ſeveral general rules to be obſerved, according to the circumſtances or qualities of thoſe materials. The caſks which contain any liquid are, according to the ſea phraſe, to be h <hi rend="italic">ung-up</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bilge-free,</hi> i. e. cloſely wedged up in an horizontal poſition, and reſting on their quarters: ſo that the bilges where they are thickeſt being entirely free all round, cannot rub againſt each other by the motion of the veſſel. Dry goods, or ſuch as may be damaged by the water, are to be carefully incloſed in caſks, bales, caſes, or wrappers; and wedged off from the bottom and sides of the ſhip, as well as from the bow, maſts, and pump- well. Due attention muſt likewise be had to their disposition with regard to each other, and to the trim and centre of gravity of the ſhip ; so that the heavieſt may always be neareſt the keel, and the lighteſt gradually above them.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
