<p><span class="font2">D = A (A — C) tc<sup>2</sup> + B (B — C) w<sup>12</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now, if we suppose the axis of instantaneous rotation to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be situated at the commencement of the motion, very near the axis OZ, the angular velocity about which = «/', then&nbsp;the angle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font2"> which it makes with that axis being very small,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">the angular velocities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and «/ will be very small in comparison of «/', and consequently D must be a very small quantity. Now D is constant; and therefore if the two differences A — C and B — C have the same sign, which will be the case when the value of B is intermediate between&nbsp;A and C, the two velocities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and m/ must always be very&nbsp;small; and hence (64) the instantaneous axis will never deviate much from OZ when this is the axis of greatest or of&nbsp;least moment. But if A — C and B — C have opposite&nbsp;signs, as will be the case when the value of C lies between&nbsp;the values of A and B, then D may be a very small quantity, and the equation still be satisfied, although the values of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and «/ be large; and hence, although the axis&nbsp;of instantaneous rotation may have been very near the axis&nbsp;C at the commencement of the motion, it may deviate to&nbsp;any extent from that axis during the motion. Hence we&nbsp;infer that the rotation about the axes, both of greatest and&nbsp;least moment, is permanent, but that the rotation about the&nbsp;intermediate axis is not permanent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">77. The same conclusions may also be obtained by the&nbsp;direct integration of the equations (a) of (75), if we neglect, as insensible, the squares and products of the small&nbsp;velocities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and io*. Restricting the calculus to this approximation, the third equation (a) becomes rfw&quot; = 0,&nbsp;whence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vf = h, k</span><span class="font2"> being an assured arbitrary constant.

<p><span class="font2">In order to integrate these, assume</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">On substituting these values of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w, rd, dw, dw',</span><span class="font2"> and rejecting the common factors, the equations </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font2"> become</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">which are the complete integrals of the equations (d).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If in these expressions the quantity denoted by X is real, which will be the case when C is the least or the greatest&nbsp;of the three moments, the values of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w’</span><span class="font2"> must always&nbsp;continue small, because they are proportional to the sines&nbsp;and cosines of a real angle; but if C be intermediate between A and B, the X will be an impossible quantity, and&nbsp;the sine and cosine of the arc XAZ -)- </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font2"> will be changed into exponentials which increase continually with the time /,&nbsp;whence the velocities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xo</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xd</span><span class="font2"> will also increase indefinitely ; and consequently, by Frisi’s theorem, the deviation&nbsp;of the instantaneous axis of rotation from the original axis&nbsp;will increase indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we suppose that at the commencement of the motion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the axis of instantaneous rotation coincided accurately with 1 the principal axis OZ, we should have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> = 0, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xd —</span><span class="font2"> 0, when <sup>s&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2"> = 0 ; and as in this case we have also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> = 0, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">id&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">will always be zero, or the body will continue for ever to&nbsp;revolve uniformly about OZ. We have therefore, from&nbsp;what precedes, these mechanical properties relative to the&nbsp;rotation of solid bodies : 1. If a body begins to revolve&nbsp;about any one of the three principal axes, and is affected&nbsp;by no external force, it will continue always to revolve&nbsp;about that axis ; 2. If it begins to revolve about an axis&nbsp;which is very near the axis of the greatest or least moment,&nbsp;then, although the motion is disturbed a little by the action&nbsp;of an extraneous force, the instantaneous axis of rotation&nbsp;will continue very near the original axis ; 3. If the rotation&nbsp;commences about the axis of the mean moment of inertia,&nbsp;then, if the smallest disturbance takes place, the effect will&nbsp;increase indefinitely with the time, and the poles of rotation will entirely change their position on the surface of&nbsp;the body. These properties establish an essential difference&nbsp;between the three principal axes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">78. Our limits will not permit us to enter further into </span><span class="font1">C&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the discussion of this subject, nor is it within the scope of&nbsp;the present article to apply the formulæ to the rotation of&nbsp;the planets, an example of which application has already&nbsp;been given in the article Precession of the Equinoxes.&nbsp;It has now been shown that every circumstance relative to&nbsp;the motion of a solid body, acted upon by any number of&nbsp;forces, is expressed by means of two systems of equations&nbsp;(each containing three differential equations of the first order), the first system (62) defining the motion in space of&nbsp;the centre of gravity, and the second (73) the rotation&nbsp;about that centre. At the commencement of the motion&nbsp;these two systems are independent of each other ; but it is&nbsp;important to remark, that this independence does not necessarily continue during the motion. If we suppose the&nbsp;moving forces to act upon different points of the body, and&nbsp;to be functions of the co-ordinates of those points, that is,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font2">vary with their distance from the origin, then the coordinates enter at the same time into both systems of equations, which therefore cannot be integrated separately, the&nbsp;two motions affecting each other. The integrals can then&nbsp;only be obtained by approximation. There are, however,&nbsp;two important cases in which the two motions continue to&nbsp;be permanently independent of each other. The first is&nbsp;that of a projectile which, during its motion, is acted upon&nbsp;by no other force than gravity ; for in this case the equations (62) will be those of an isolated material point, and&nbsp;the weight of the body, acting as a single force applied to&nbsp;the centre of gravity, will have no influence on the rotation, which will be the same as if the centre of gravity were&nbsp;fixed. The second is the case of a sphere, either homogeneous or composed of concentric strata of different densities, the density of each stratum being constant ; for in this&nbsp;case the resultant of all the attractive forces, as was shown&nbsp;by Newton, passes through the centre of gravity, which&nbsp;will therefore move as an isolated point, and the motion of&nbsp;rotation will be the same as if the centre of gravity were&nbsp;fixed.</span></p>
