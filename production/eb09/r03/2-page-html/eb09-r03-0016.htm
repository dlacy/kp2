                only into rubricated titles ; and the general impression is that&nbsp;the
                formularies of actions were split up and distributed in their&nbsp;appropriate
                places. The arrangement is not difficult to discover&nbsp;by comparison of the
                various commentaries upon it, particularly&nbsp;those of Ulpian and Paul, which each
                contained over eighty books.&nbsp;First came a series of titles dealing with the
                foundations and first&nbsp;steps of all legal procedure,—jurisdiction, summons,

                From&nbsp;the quotations from the Julian </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span class="font1"> embodied in the

                supposed to have been borrowed&nbsp;from it, and are of comparatively little value.

                Counsel.—</span><span class="font1">The right of responding under imperial authority
                (jms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">respondendi ex
                auctoritate principis),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">first granted by Augustus
                and continued by his successors down to&nbsp;the time of Alexander Severus, did not
                imply any curtailment of&nbsp;the right of unlicensed jurists to give advice to any
                one who chose&nbsp;to consult them. What it did was to give an authoritative
                character to a response, so that the judge who had asked for it and to&nbsp;whom it
                was presented—for the judges were but private citizens,&nbsp;most of them unlearned
                in the law—was bound to adopt it as if it&nbsp;had emanated from the emperor
                himself. It may be that Augustus was actuated by a political motive,—that he was
                desirous by&nbsp;this concession to attach lawyers of eminence to the new
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">régime,&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1">and prevent the recurrence of the evils experienced during the
                republic from the too great influence of patrons. But, whatever may&nbsp;have
                prompted his action in the matter, its beneficial consequences&nbsp;for the law can
                hardly be overrated. For the quasi - legislative&nbsp;powers with which they were
                invested enabled the patented counsel&nbsp;to influence current doctrine not
                speculatively merely but positively&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

        <p><span class="font1">Instead of giving his opinion like the unlicensed jurist by word of
                mouth, either at the request of the judge or at the instance of&nbsp;one of the
                parties, the patented counsel, who did not require to&nbsp;give his reasons, reduced
                it to writing and sent it to the court&nbsp;under seal. Augustus does not seem to
                have contemplated the&nbsp;possibility of conflicting responses being tendered from
                two or more&nbsp;jurists equally privileged. It was an awkward predicament for
                a&nbsp;judge to be placed in. Hadrian solved the difficulty by declaring&nbsp;that
                in such a case the judge should be entitled to use his
                    own&nbsp;discretion.@@<sup>2</sup> That on receiving a response 'with which he
                was dissatisfied he could go on calling for others until he got one to
                his&nbsp;mind, and then pronounce judgment in accordance with it on the&nbsp;ground
                that there was difference of opinion, is extremely unlikely.&nbsp;The more probable
                explanation of Hadrian’s rescript is, that the&nbsp;number of patented responding
                counsel was very limited ; that a&nbsp;judge, if he desired their assistance, was
                required by this rescript&nbsp;to consult them all </span><span class="font1"

        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Constitutions of the
                    Emperors@@<sup>3</sup>
            </span><span class="font1">Gaius and Ulpian concur in holding that every imperial
                constitution, whether in the shape of&nbsp;rescript, decree, or edict, had the force
                of statute. It may be that&nbsp;by the time of Ulpian that was the prevailing
                opinion ; but modern&nbsp;criticism is disposed to regard the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dictum</span><span class="font1"> of Gaius,
                written in the&nbsp;time of Antoninus Pius, as coloured by his Asiatic notions, and
                not&nbsp;quite accurate so far as the edicts were concerned. As supreme magistrate
                the emperor had the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                cdicendi</span><span class="font1"> that kings, consuls, and prsetors had had before
                him, and used it as they did to indicate some course of action he meant to adopt and
                follow or&nbsp;some relief he proposed to grant. His range, of course, was
                much&nbsp;greater than that of the prsetors had been ; for his authority endured for
                life, and extended over the whole empire and every&nbsp;department of government.
                But originally, and in principle, his&nbsp;successor on the throne was no more bound
                to adopt any of his&nbsp;edicts than a praetor was to adopt those of his
                predecessors. That&nbsp;it was not unusual for an edict to be renewed, and that it
                occasionally happened that the renewal was not by the immediate successor&nbsp;of
                its original author, are manifest from various passages in the texts.&nbsp;Very
                frequently, when its utility had stood the test of years, it was&nbsp;transmuted
                into a senatusconsult ; this fact proves of itself that&nbsp;an edict </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per se</span><span class="font1"> had not
                the effect of statute. But their adoption&nbsp;by a succession of two or three
                sovereigns, whose reigns were of&nbsp;average duration, may have been held
                sufficient to give them the&nbsp;character of consuetudinary law ; and, by a not
                unnatural process,&nbsp;unreflecting public opinion may have come to impute force
                of&nbsp;statute to the edict itself rather than to the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">longa consuetudo</span><span class="font1">
                that&nbsp;followed on it, thus paving the way for the assertion by the sovereigns of
                the later empire of an absolute right of legislation, and&nbsp;for the recognition
                of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex cdictalis
                {infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 710) as the only&nbsp;form of
            statute.</span></p>

                habent)</span><span class="font1"> from the earliest days of the empire,
                and&nbsp;their operation was never limited to the lifetime of the prince
                from&nbsp;whom they had proceeded. But they were not directly acts
                of&nbsp;legislation. In both the emperor theoretically did no more
                than&nbsp;authoritatively interpret existing law, although the boundary between
                interpretation and new law, sometimes difficult to define,&nbsp;was not always
                strictly adhered to. The rescript was an answer&nbsp;by the emperor to a petition,
                either by an official or a private&nbsp;party, for an instruction as to how the law
                was to be applied to&nbsp;the facts set forth ; when the answer was in a separate
                writing it&nbsp;was usually spoken of as an </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">epistula</span><span class="font1">; when noted at the
                foot of&nbsp;the application its technical name was </span><span class="font1"

                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adnotatio.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                court in its earliest stage, or when it&nbsp;came before him by appeal. It was as a
                judge that the emperor&nbsp;pronounced his decree ; but, proceeding as it did from
                the fountain&nbsp;of authoritative interpretation, it had a value far beyond that
                of&nbsp;the sentence of an inferior court (which was law only as between&nbsp;the
                parties), and formed a precedent which governed all future&nbsp;cases involving the
                same question. Those decrees and rescripts&nbsp;constituted one of the most
                important sources of the law during&nbsp;the first three centuries and more of the
                empire, and were elaborated&nbsp;with the assistance of the most eminent jurists of
                the day, the&nbsp;rescripts being the special charge of the </span><span
