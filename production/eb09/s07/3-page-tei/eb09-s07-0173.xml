The publication of it in a complete form is much to be desired. The MSS. available in Europe are—Cod. Vat. clxv. <hi rend="italic">(Catal.,</hi> iii. 331), of which Codd.

We suspect, however, that the person meant is 'Abd al-Masih (Ya'kūb) ibn Ishāk al-Kindi, the author of a well known apology for the Christian religion, which has been published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.@@<hi rend="superscript">18</hi> The work dates from the time of the caliph</p><p>al-Ma’mūn (813-833), and therefore synchronizes with the disputations of Theodore Abu Korrah, bishop of Ilarrān.@@<hi rend="superscript">19</hi> Being written in Arabic, it hardly belongs to this place, but is mentioned to avoid misapprehension.</p><p>Theodore bar Khōni is stated to have been promoted by his uncle John IV. to the bishopric of Lashōm in 893.@@<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> He was the author ∣ of scholia (on the Scriptures), an ecclesiastical history, and some minor works.</p><p>To about this period probably belongs another historian, the loss . of whose work we have to regret.

Most of the dignitaries of the church composed their synodical epistles and other official writings in Arabic, and the same may be said of the men of science, such as Abu 'Ali ’Isa ibn Ishāk ihn Zur'ah (943-1008) and Abū Zakariyā Yahyā ibn 'Adi, who died in 974 at the age of eighty-one. About the middle of the century we may venture to place the deacon Simeon, whose <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is cited by Elias bai’ Shīnāyā under 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> =627- 628 A.D. and 310 = 922-923.@@<hi rend="superscript">22</hi> The 11th century is somewhat more prolific.</p><p>A Persian Christian named Gīsā,@@<hi rend="superscript">23</hi> leaving his native city of Ushnūkh or Ushnū in Adharbāigān, settled, after several removals, in the district of Gūbōs or Gūbās,@@<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> one of the seven dioceses of the province of Melitēne (Malatiah), and built there a humble church, in which he deposited sundry relics of St Sergius and St Bacchus, and cells for himself and Ids three companions. This happened in 958.@@<hi rend="superscript">25</hi> As the place grew in importance, other monks gradually resorted to it, and among them “ Mār(i) Yōhannān dē- Mārōn,” or John (the son) of Mārōn,@@<hi rend="superscript">26</hi> a man of learning in both sacred and profane literature, who had studied under Mār Mēkīm at Edessa. Gīsā, the founder of the convent, died at the end of twelve years, and was succeeded as abbot by his disciple Elias, who beautified the church. Meantime its fame increased as a seat of learning under the direction of John of Mārōn, and many scribes found employment there. The patriarch John VII., <hi rend="italic">da-sérīghtā, </hi>“He of the Mat” (his only article of furniture),@@<hi rend="superscript">27</hi> was one of its visitors. Elias, on his retirement, nominated John of Mārōn as his successor, who, aided by the munificence of Emmanuel, a monk of Harrān and a disciple of the maphriān Cyriacus,@@<hi rend="superscript">28</hi> rebuilt the church on a larger and finer scale, whilst a constant supply of fresh water was provided at the cost of a Taghritan merchant named Mārūthā. This was in 1001. About this time Elias bar Gāghai, a monk of Taghrith, founded a monastery near Melitēne, but died before it was finished. His work was taken up by one Eutychus or Kulaib, who persuaded John of Mārōn to join him. Here again his teaching attracted numbers of pupils. At last, after the lapse of twelve years, when there were 120 priests in the convent, he suddenly withdrew by night from the scene of his labours and retired to the monastery of Mār Aaron near Edessa, where he died at the end of four years, about 1017. His commentary on the book of Wisdom is cited by Bar-Hebræus in the <hi rend="italic">Ausar Raze.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">*</hi></p><p>Mark bar Kiki was archdeacon of the Taghritan church at Mosul, and was raised to the dignity of maphriān by the name of Ignatius in 991.@@<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> After holding this office for twenty-five years, he became a Muhammadan in 1016,@@<hi rend="superscript">31</hi> but recanted before his death, which took place at an advanced age@@<hi rend="superscript">32</hi> in great poverty. He composed a poem on his own fall, misery, and subsequent repentance, of which Bar- Hebræus has preserved a few lines.@@<hi rend="superscript">33</hi></p><p>According to Assemani, <hi rend="italic">B.O.,</hi> ii. 317 and cl., Bar-Hebræus mentions in his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> that a monk named Joseph wrote three discourses on the cruel murder of Peter the deacon by the Turks at Melitēne in 1058. The anecdote may be found in the edition of Bruns and Kirsch, p. 252 (transi., p. 258), but the discourses would seem rather to have dealt with the retribution that overtook the retiring Turks at the hands of the Armenians and the wintry weather.</p><p>Yēshū' bar Shūshan (or Susanna), syncellus of Theodore or John IX., was chosen patriarch by the eastern bishops, under the name of John X., in opposition to Hāyē or Athanasius Vl., on whom the choice of their western brethren had fallen in 1058.@@<hi rend="superscript">34</hi> He soon abdicated, however, retired to a convent, and devoted himself to study.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> Bar-Hebræus (Zoe. ciZ.)says 205 Am. = 820-821 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> ; see above, p. 845.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic"> Chron.
