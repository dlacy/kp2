<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICH, RICHARD, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ist Baron Rich</span><span class="font0"> (1490 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">?-i</span><span class="font0"> 567), lord chancellor, was born of a Hampshire family about 1490, in the parish of St Laurence Jewry, London. His great-grandfather,&nbsp;Richard Rich, was a wealthy mercer and sheriff of the city of&nbsp;London in 1441. Probably Lord Rich’s father was also a mercer,&nbsp;but he sent his son to the Middle Temple, where Sir Thomas More&nbsp;was among his acquaintances. More told him at the time of&nbsp;his trial that he was reputed light of his tongue, a great dicer&nbsp;and gamester, and not of any commendable fame; but he was&nbsp;a commissioner of the peace in Hertfordshire in 1528, and in&nbsp;the next autumn became reader at the Middle Temple. Other&nbsp;preferments followed, and in 1533 he was knighted and became&nbsp;solicitor-general, in which capacity he was to act under Thomas&nbsp;Cromwell as a “ lesser hammer ” for the demolition of the&nbsp;monasteries, and to secure the operation of Henry VIII’s act&nbsp;of supremacy. He had an odious share in the trials of Sir&nbsp;Thomas More and Bishop Fisher. In both cases he made use&nbsp;in his evidence against the prisoner of admissions made in&nbsp;a professedly friendly conversation, and in More’s case the&nbsp;words he had used were misreported and received a misconstruction that could hardly be other than wilful. More expressed his opinion of the witness in open court with a candour&nbsp;that might well have dismayed Rich. Rich became the first&nbsp;chancellor (April 19, 1536) of the Court of Augmentations&nbsp;established for the disposal of the monastic revenues. His&nbsp;own share of the spoil, acquired either by grant or purchase,&nbsp;included Leez (Leighs) Priory and about a hundred manors in&nbsp;Essex. He was Speaker of the House of Commons in the same&nbsp;year, and advocated the king’s policy. In spite of the share&nbsp;he had taken in the suppression of the monasteries, and of the&nbsp;part he was to play under Edward VI., his religious convictions&nbsp;remained Roman Catholic. His testimony helped the conviction of Thomas Cromwell, and he was a willing agent in the&nbsp;Catholic reaction which followed. Anne Askew stated that&nbsp;the Chancellor Wriothesley and Rich screwed the rack at her&nbsp;torture with their own hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rich was one of the executors of the will of Henry VHI., on which so much suspicion has been thrown, and on the 26th&nbsp;of February 1548 he became Baron Rich of Leez. In the next&nbsp;month he succeeded Wriothesley as chancellor, an office in&nbsp;which he found full scope for the business and legal ability he&nbsp;undoubtedly possessed. He supported Protector Somerset in&nbsp;his subversive reforms in church matters, in the prosecution&nbsp;of his brother Lord Seymour of Sudeley, and in the rest of his&nbsp;policy until the crisis of his fortunes in October 1549, when he deserted to Warwick (afterwards Northumberland), and presided over the trial of his former chief. His daughter had&nbsp;married Warwick’s son, and both men were at heart no friends&nbsp;to the reformed religion. Nevertheless, Rich took part in&nbsp;the prosecution of bishops Gardiner and Bonner, and in the&nbsp;harsh treatment accorded to the Princess Mary. Possibly this&nbsp;harshness was exaggerated, for Mary on her accession showed&nbsp;no ill-will to Rich. He retired from the chancellorship on the&nbsp;ground of ill-health in the close of 1551, at the time of the final&nbsp;breach between Northumberland and Somerset. He was now&nbsp;sixty years old, and there is no reason to suspect the sincerity&nbsp;of his plea. There is an improbable story, however, to the&nbsp;effect that Rich warned Somerset of his danger in the Tower,&nbsp;and that the letter was delivered by mistake to the duke of&nbsp;Norfolk, who handed it to Northumberland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lord Rich took an active part in the restoration of the old religion in Essex under the new reign, and was one of the most&nbsp;active of persecutors. His reappearances in the privy council&nbsp;were rare during Mary’s reign; but under Elizabeth he served&nbsp;on a commission to inquire into the grants of land made under&nbsp;Mary, and in 1566 was sent for to advise on the question of the&nbsp;queen’s marriage. He died at Rochford, Essex, on the 12th of&nbsp;June 1567, and was buried in Felsted church. In Mary’s reign&nbsp;he had founded a chaplaincy with provision for the singing of&nbsp;masses and dirges, and the ringing of bells in Felsted church.&nbsp;To this was added a Lenten allowance of herrings to the inhabitants of three parishes. These donations were transferred&nbsp;in 1564 to the foundation of a grammar-school at Felsted for&nbsp;instruction, primarily for children born on the founder’s manors,&nbsp;in Latin, Greek and divinity. The patronage of the school&nbsp;remained in the family of the founder untiI 1851. By his wife&nbsp;Elizabeth Jenks, or Gynkes, he had fifteen children. The&nbsp;eldest son Robert (1537?-! 581), second Baron Rich, supported&nbsp;the Reformation, and his grandson Robert, third lord, was&nbsp;created earl of Warwick in 1618.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHARD, ST, of Wyche (c. 1197-1253), English saint and bishop, was named after his birthplace, Droitwich in Worcestershire. Educated at Oxford, he soon began to teach in the&nbsp;university, of which he became chancellor, probably after he&nbsp;had studied in Paris and in Bologna. About 1235 he became&nbsp;chancellor of the diocese of Canterbury under Archbishop&nbsp;Edmund Rich, and he was with the archbishop during his&nbsp;exile in France. Having returned to England some time after&nbsp;Edmund’s death in 1240 he became vicar of Deal and chancellor&nbsp;of Canterbury for the second time. In 1244 he was elected&nbsp;bishop of Chichester, being consecrated at Lyons by Pope&nbsp;Innocent IV. in March 1245, although Henry III. refused to&nbsp;give him the temporalities of the see, the king favouring the&nbsp;candidature of Robert Passelewe (d. 1252). In 1246, however,&nbsp;Richard obtained the temporalities. The new bishop showed&nbsp;much eagerness to reform the manners and morals of his clergy,&nbsp;and also to introduce greater order and reverence into the&nbsp;services of the church. His term of office was also marked&nbsp;by the favour which he showed to the Dominicans, a house of&nbsp;this order at Orleans having sheltered him during his stay in&nbsp;France, and by his earnestness in preaching a crusade. He&nbsp;died at Dover in April 1253. It was generally believed that&nbsp;miracles were wrought at his tomb in Chichester cathedral,&nbsp;which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262 he&nbsp;was canonized at Viterbo by Pope Urban IV. Richard furnished&nbsp;the chronicler, Matthew Paris, with material for the life of&nbsp;Edmund Rich, and instituted the offerings for the cathedral&nbsp;at Chichester which were known later as “ St Richard’s pence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His life by his confessor, Ralph Bocking, is published in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acta Sanctorum</span><span class="font0"> of the Bollandists, where a later and shorter life&nbsp;by John Capgrave is also to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHARD (d. 1184), archbishop of Canterbury, was a Norman, who became a monk at Canterbury, where he acted as chaplain&nbsp;to Archbishop Theobald and was a colleague of Thomas Becket.&nbsp;In 1173, more than two years after the murder of Becket, it was&nbsp;decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there&nbsp;were two candidates, Richard, at that time prior of St Martin’s,&nbsp;Dover, and Odo, prior of Canterbury, and in June Richard was&nbsp;chosen, although Odo was the</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font0">nominee of the monks. Objections&nbsp;were raised against this election both in England and in Rome,&nbsp;but in April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagui&nbsp;by Pope Alexander III., and he returned to England towards&nbsp;the close of the year. The ten years during which Richard was&nbsp;archbishop were disturbed by disputes with Roger, archbishop&nbsp;of York, over the respective rights of the two sees, and in 1175,&nbsp;at a council held in London, there was a free fight between their&nbsp;partisans. Henry II. arranged a truce for five years between the&nbsp;rival prelates, but Richard was soon involved in another quarrel,&nbsp;this being with Roger, abbot of St Augustine’s, Canterbury,&nbsp;whose action also trenched upon the privileges of the archbishop.&nbsp;Richard was more acceptable to Henry II. than Bccket had&nbsp;been; he attended the royal councils, and more than once he&nbsp;was with the king in Normandy. Henry probably preferred&nbsp;him because he insisted less on the rights of the clergy than his&nbsp;great predecessor had done; but the monastic writers and the&nbsp;followers of Becket regarded this attitude as a sign of weakness.&nbsp;Richard died at Rochester on the 16th of February 1184 and was</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
