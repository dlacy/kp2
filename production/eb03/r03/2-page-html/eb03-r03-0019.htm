<p><span class="font1">heart </span><span class="font0">is made of inferior fluff, flack laid,· and of a ſize juſt equal to the ſpace it is to fill. When a rope of&nbsp;' this fabric has been long uſed and become unſerviceable,&nbsp;and is opened out, the heart is always found cut and&nbsp;chaffed to pieces, like very ſhort oakum. This happens&nbsp;as follows ; When the rope is violently ſtrained, it&nbsp;ſtretches greatly .; becauſe the ſtrands ſui round the axis obliquely, and the ſtrain draws them into a poſition&nbsp;more parallel to the axis. But the heart has not the&nbsp;obliquity of parts, and cannot ſtretch ſo much ; at the&nbsp;ſame time, its yarns are firmly graſped by the hard&nbsp;ſtrands which ſurround them ; they muſt therefore be&nbsp;rtorn into ſhort pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proceſs for laying a rope with a heart is not veιy different from that already deſcribed. The top&nbsp;has a hole pierçed through it, in the direction of the&nbsp;axis. The ſkain or ſtrand intended for the heart paſſes&nbsp;through this hole, and is ſtretched along the walk. A&nbsp;boy attends it, holding it tight as it is taken into&nbsp;the cloſing rope. But a little attention to what has&nbsp;been ſaid will ſhow this method to be defective. The&nbsp;wick will have no more turns than the laid rope ; and&nbsp;as it lies in the very axis, its yarns will be much&nbsp;ſtraighter than the ſtrands. Therefore when the rope&nbsp;is ſtrained and ſtretched, the wick cannot ctretch as&nbsp;much as the laid ſtrands ; and being firmly graſped by&nbsp;them, it muſt break into ſhort pieces, and the ſtrands,&nbsp;having loſt their ſupport in thoſe places, will fink in,&nbsp;and the cordage grow looſe. We ſhould endeavour to&nbsp;enable all to ſtretch alike. The wick therefore ſhould&nbsp;fee twiſted in the ſame manner as the ſtrands, perhaps&nbsp;even a little more. It will thus communicate part of&nbsp;its ſtrength to the rope. Indeed it will not be ſo uniformly ſolid, and may chance to have three ſpiral vacuities. But that this does no harm, is quite evident&nbsp;from the ſuperior ſtrength of cable-laid cordage, to be&nbsp;deſcribed preſently, which have the ſame vacuities. In&nbsp;this way are the main and fore ſtays made for ſhips of&nbsp;the line. They are thought ſtronger than hawſer-laid ropes, but unfit for running rigging; becauſe their&nbsp;ſtrands are apt to get out of their places when the&nbsp;rope is drawn into loops. Tt is alſo thought that the&nbsp;heart retains water, rots, and communicates its putrefaction to the ſurrounding ſtrands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Such is the general and eſſential proceſs of rope-making. The fibres of hemp are twiſted into yarns, that they may make a line of any length, and ſtick among&nbsp;each other with a force equal to their own coheſion.&nbsp;Thfe yarns are made into cords of permanent twiſt by&nbsp;laying them ; and, that we may have a rope of any degree of ſtrength, many yarns are united in one ſtrand,&nbsp;for the ſame reaſon that many fibres were united in one&nbsp;yarn ; and in the courſe of this proceſs it is in our&nbsp;power to give the rope a ſolidity and hardneſs which&nbsp;makes it leſs penetrable by water, which would rot it in&nbsp;a ſhor while.. Somç of theſe purpoſes are inconſiſtent&nbsp;with others : and the ſkill of a rope-maker lies in making the beſt compenſation ; ſo that the rope may on&nbsp;the whole be the beſt in point of ſtrength, pliancy, and&nbsp;duration, that the quantity of hemp in it can produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is another ſpecies of cordage </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">very general uſe. A rope o<sup>i</sup> two or more ſtrands may be uſed as a&nbsp;ſtr?nd, in order to compoſe a ſtill larger rope ; and in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">this manner are cables and other ground tackle com</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">monly made ; for this reaſon ſuch cordage is called cable-laid cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proceſs of cable-laying hardly differs from that oſ hawſer-laying. Three ropes, in their ſtate of permanent twiſt, may be twiſted together ; but they will&nbsp;not hold it, like fine thread, becauſe they are ſtiff and&nbsp;elaiſic. They muſt therefore be treated like ſtrands&nbsp;for a hawſer. We muſt give them an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">additional</span><span class="font0"> twfiſt,&nbsp;which will diſpoſe them to lay or cloſe tllemſeives ; and&nbsp;this diſpoſition muſt be aided by the workmen at the&nbsp;ſledge. We ſay the twiſt ſhould be an addition to their&nbsp;twiſt as a rope. A twiſt in the oppoſite direction will&nbsp;indeed give them a diſpoſition to cloſe behind the top ;&nbsp;but this will be very ſmall, and the ropes (now ſtrands)&nbsp;will be exceedingly open, and will become more open&nbsp;in laying. The twiſt is therefore given in the direction of their twiſt as a rope, or oppoſite to that of the&nbsp;ριimary ſtrands, of which the ropes are compoſed.&nbsp;Theſe primary ſtrands are therefore partly untwiſted in&nbsp;cable-laying a rope, in the ſame manner as the yarns&nbsp;are untwiſted in the uſual proceſs of rope-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We need not infill farther on this part-of the manufacture. The reader muſt be ſenſible that the hawſers intended for ſtrands of a cable muſt not be ſo much&nbsp;twiſted as thoſe intended to remain hawſers ; for the&nbsp;twiſt given to a ſiniſhed hawſer is preſumed to be that&nbsp;which renders it moſt perfect, and it muſt be injured by&nbsp;any addition. The preciſe proportion, and the diftri-butionof the working up between the hardening of the&nbsp;ſtrands and cloſing the cable, is a ſubject about which&nbsp;the artiſts are no better agreed than in the caſe of haw-ſer-laid cordage. We did not enter on this ſubject&nbsp;while deſcribing the proceſs, -becauſe the introduction&nbsp;of reaſonings and principles would have hurt the ſim-plicity of the defcription.∙ The reader being now acquainted with the different parts of the manipulation,&nbsp;and knowing what can be done on any occaſion, will&nbsp;now be able to judge of the propriety oſ the whole,&nbsp;when he learns the principle on which the ſtrength of&nbsp;a rope depends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already ſaid, that a rope-yarn ſhould be twiſted till a fibre will break rather than be pulled out&nbsp;from among the reſt, and that all twiſting beyond this is&nbsp;injurious to the ſtrength of the yarn : And we advanced&nbsp;this maxim upon this plain coniideration, that it is need-leſs to bind them cloſer together, for they will already&nbsp;break rather than come out ; and becauſe this cloſer&nbsp;binding is produced only by forcibly wrapping the outer fibres round the inner, and drawing the outer ones&nbsp;tight. Thus theſe fibres are on the ſtretch, and are&nbsp;ſtrained as if a weight were hung on each of them.&nbsp;The proceſs of laying lines, of a permanent twiſt, ſhows&nbsp;that we muſt do a little more. We muſt give the yarn&nbsp;a degree of elaſtic contractility, which will make it lay&nbsp;itſelf and form a line or cord which will retain its twiſt.&nbsp;This muſt leave the fibres of the yarns in a ſtate of&nbsp;greater compreſſion than iβ neceſſary for juſt keeping&nbsp;them together. But more than this ſeems to be need-leſs and hurtful. The ſame maxim muſt direct us in&nbsp;forming a rope conſiſting of ſtrands, containing more&nbsp;than one yarn. A needleſs exceſs of twiſt leaves them&nbsp;ſtrained, and leſs able to perform their office in the&nbsp;rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It not unſrequently happens, that the workman, in </span><span class="font1">order to </span><span class="font0">make his rope ſolid and. firm, hardens </span><span class="font1">up</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
