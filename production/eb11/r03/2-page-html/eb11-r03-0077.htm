                from toll and taxes, and the privilege of holding a court,&nbsp;although both
                charters attributed to him are known to be&nbsp;spurious. At the same time he is
                said to have given the manor&nbsp;to Wulfstan, archbishop of York. About 950 the
                monastery&nbsp;and town were destroyed by King Edred during his
                expedition&nbsp;against the Danes, but the monastery was rebuilt by the archbishops
                of York, and about the time of the Conquest was&nbsp;changed to a collegiate church.
                In 1318, when the Scots invaded England, Ripon only escaped being burnt a
                second&nbsp;time by the payment of 1000 marks. The custom of blowing&nbsp;the
                wakeman’s horn every night at nine o’clock is said to have&nbsp;originated about
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span
                class="font1"> 700. It was probably at first a means of&nbsp;calling the people
                together in case of a sudden invasion, but&nbsp;was afterwards a signal for setting
                the watch. A hoin with&nbsp;a baldric and the motto “ Except the Lord keep the city
                the&nbsp;watchman waketh but in vain ” forms the mayor’s badge.&nbsp;The archbishops
                of York as lords of the manor had various&nbsp;privileges in the town, among which
                were the right of holding&nbsp;a market and fair, and Archbishop John, being
                summoned&nbsp;in the reign of Henry I. to answer by what right he claimed&nbsp;these
                privileges, said that he held them by prescription and by&nbsp;the charter of King
                Æthelstan. Henry I. afterwards granted&nbsp;or confirmed to Arehbishop Thomas a fair
                on the feast of St&nbsp;Wilfrid and four fOllowdng days. The fairs and markets
                belonged to the archbishops of York until they were transferred&nbsp;to the bishop
                of Ripon in 1837. In 1857 they were transferred&nbsp;to the ecclesiastical
                commissioners, from whom they were&nbsp;purchased by the corporation of Ripon in
                1880. From before&nbsp;the Conquest until the incorporation charter of 1604
                Ripon&nbsp;was governed by a wakeman and 12 elders, or aldermen,&nbsp;but in 1604
                the title of wakeman was changed to mayor, and&nbsp;12 aldermen and 24 common
                councilmen were appointed. The&nbsp;manufacture of cloth was at one time carried on
                in Ripon, but&nbsp;was almost lost in the 16th century when the town was
                visited&nbsp;by Leland. The making of spurs succeeded the cloth manufacture and
                became so noted that the saying “ as true as Ripon&nbsp;rowells ” was a well-known
                proverb. This manufacture .died&nbsp;oùt in the 18th century. Ripon was summoned to
                send two&nbsp;members to parliament in 1295, and occasionally from that&nbsp;time
                until 1328-29. The privilege was revived in 1553, after&nbsp;which the burgesses
                continued to send two members until 1867,&nbsp;when they were allowed only one. This
                latter privilege was&nbsp;taken away by the Redistribution Bill of 1883, and it now
                gives&nbsp;its name to one of the divisions of the county.</span></p>

                library, which also houses the library of the Ripon&nbsp;Historical Society, and is
                the seat of Ripon College (nonsectarian, co-educational), which was founded in 1830
                as the&nbsp;Lyceum of Ripon, and was named Ripon College in 1864;&nbsp;in 1908 it
                had 23 instructors and 279 students. There are&nbsp;grain elevators and various
                manufactories, among the products&nbsp;of which are cheese and other creamery
                products, flour, knit&nbsp;goods, pickles and canned goods, woodenware, washing
                machines&nbsp;and gloves.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The site of Ripon was purchased in 1838 by John Scott Homer
                (1802-1883), of Virgima, secretary and acting-governor&nbsp;of Michigan Territory in
                1835, and the first secretary of Wisconsin Territory in 1836-37, who named the
                village when&nbsp;it was established in 1849 from the seat of his ancestors&nbsp;in
                Yorkshire. In May 1844 a settlement, named Ceresco or&nbsp;“ the Wisconsin Phalanx,”
                a Fourierist community,@@<sup>1</sup> organized&nbsp;in Southport (now Kenosha), had
                been established in the&nbsp;vicinity. A “ Long House,” 400 ft. in length, was
                erected,&nbsp;which contained tenements, an amusement or lecture hall,&nbsp;and a
                dining-room where all ate at a common table, and where&nbsp;board was provided at
                cost, sometimes as low as sixty-three&nbsp;cents per week. The “ class of usefulness
                ” was divided&nbsp;into three groups, agricultural, mechanical and
                educational,&nbsp;with such subdivisions as necessity dictated, and an
                exact&nbsp;account of labour was kept. The community prospered&nbsp;materially from
                the start. In the second season it consisted&nbsp;of thirty families with property
                valued at $27,725; in 1846&nbsp;there were 180 resident members, and the net profit
                for the&nbsp;year was $9029. Eventually differences of opinion arose as&nbsp;to the
                division of labour, and the common dining-hall did&nbsp;not prove popular. Rivalry
                developed with the village of&nbsp;Ripon, and the community gave up its charter at
                the close of&nbsp;1850, dividing property valued at $40,000 among the shareholders.
                On the whole it was one of the most successful experiments in communism ever tried
                in America. In 1858&nbsp;Ripon absorbed the village of Ceresco and was chartered as
                a&nbsp;city. At Ripon started one of the disconnected movements&nbsp;that resulted
                in the founding of the Republican party.</span></p><div>

                class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baron,</span><span class="font1"> and
                afterwards duke of (1680-1737), political adventurer and Spanish minister,
                was&nbsp;a native of Groningen in the Netherlands. According to a&nbsp;story which
                he himself set going during his adventures in Spain,&nbsp;his family was of Spanish
                origin. But there does not appear&nbsp;to be any foundation for this assertion. The
                name was not&nbsp;uncommon in Groningen, and was borne by several persons*&nbsp;of
                some note in the 16th and 17th centuries, one of whom&nbsp;was a follower of William
                the Silent. They were people of&nbsp;some position, possessing “ lordships ” at
                Jansinia, Poelgast,&nbsp;and other places, and some at least of them were
                Roman&nbsp;Catholics. John William, if he was, as he asserted, bom a&nbsp;Roman
                Catholic, conformed to Dutch Calvinism in order to&nbsp;obtain his election as
                delegate to the states-general from&nbsp;Groningen. In 1715 he was sent by the Dutch
                government&nbsp;as ambassador to Madrid. Saint-Simon says that his character for
                probity was even then considered doubtful. The&nbsp;fortune of Orry, AIberoni and
                other foreigners in Spain, showed&nbsp;that the court of Philip V. offered a career
                to adventurers.&nbsp;Ripperda—whose name is commonly spelt. Riperda by
                the&nbsp;Spaniards—devoted himseIf to the Spanish government, and&nbsp;professed
                himself a Roman Catholic. He first attached himself&nbsp;to Alberoni, and after the
                fall of that minister he became the&nbsp;agent of Elizabeth Farnese, the restless
                and intriguing wife&nbsp;of Philip V. Though perfectly unscrupulous in money
                matters,&nbsp;and of a singularly vain and blustering disposition, he did understand
                commercial questions, and he has the merit of having&nbsp;pointed out that the
                poverty of Spain was mainly due to the&nbsp;neglect of its agriculture. But his
                fortune was not due to any&nbsp;service of a useful kind he rendered his masters. He
                rose by&nbsp;undertaking to aid the queen, whose influence over her husband&nbsp;was
                boundless, in her schemes for securing the succession to&nbsp;Parma, Plasencia and
                Tuscany for her sons. Ripperda was&nbsp;sent as special envoy to Vienna in 1725. He
                behaved with&nbsp;ridiculous* violence, but the Austrian government, which&nbsp;was
                under the influence of its own fixed idea, treated him&nbsp;seriously. The result of
                ten months of very strange diplomacy&nbsp;was a treaty by which the emperor promised
                very little, but</span></p>
