<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">F. serratus, Ilimanthalia lorea)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> some individuals bear only antheridia, and others only oogonia; among the Muscineae&nbsp;the plants are frequently either male or female; in the&nbsp;Isosporous Vascular Cryptogams the prothallia are usually&nbsp;hermaphrodite ; but exclusively male and female prothallia&nbsp;occur not unfrequently in the Filices and as a rule in the&nbsp;Equisetáceas. In the Heterosporous Vascular Cryptogams&nbsp;dioecism is brought about in a somewhat different manner:&nbsp;these plants have, as mentioned above, two kinds of spores,&nbsp;macrospores and microspores; the former on germination&nbsp;always give rise to a female (archegoniate) prothallium, the&nbsp;latter to a male (antheridial) prothallium; hence the male&nbsp;and female organs are necessarily borne on distinct organisms. In some Phanerogams even the two kinds of spores&nbsp;are produced by separate individuals, the flowers of the one&nbsp;producing pollen-grains (microspores) but no embryo-sacs,&nbsp;those of the other producing embryo-sacs (macrospores) but&nbsp;no pollen-grains. More special arrangements are to be found&nbsp;in the flowers of Phanerogams for ensuring cross-fertilization, and preventing self-fertilization, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., the development&nbsp;of highly-coloured perianth-leaves and the secretion of&nbsp;nectar to attract insects, dichogamy, heterostylism, &amp;c.;&nbsp;but it is impossible to do more than mention these here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But besides these obvious structural arrangements for ensuring cross-fertilization and preventing self-fertilization&nbsp;there are in some cases imperceptible physiological conditions which even more certainly lead to the same results.&nbsp;It appears, namely, that in such cases no sexual process&nbsp;can take place between reproductive cells or organs of&nbsp;closely-allied origin. Thus, among the Algae, in Ecto-carpus and in Aceta bularía, conjugation only takes place&nbsp;between planogametes derived from distinct gametangia,&nbsp;and in Dasycladus it only takes place between piano-gametes derived from gametangia borne by different individuals. Again, in many Phanerogams, as Darwin has&nbsp;shown, the pollen of one flower is quite incapable of&nbsp;fertilizing the oospheres of its own ovules, and the pollen-grains from another flower borne by the same plant is&nbsp;but slightly, if at all, more potent. The pollen from the&nbsp;flower of another individual of the same species is potent,&nbsp;and this the more so the wider the difference between&nbsp;the individuals; the pollen from an individual of a&nbsp;different variety is more potent than that from an individual of the same variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The effect of the sexual process is not necessarily confined to the cells or organs which directly take part in it; not infrequently it makes itself felt in adjoining organs,&nbsp;stimulating them to active growth, giving rise to the&nbsp;formation of a fruit or fructification. Thus in the Mu-corini an outgrowth of filaments, forming an incomplete&nbsp;or complete (Mortierella) investment to the zygospore,&nbsp;takes place from the sexual organs after conjugation; in&nbsp;Coleochsete the oogonium becomes surrounded, after the&nbsp;fertilization of the oosphere, by an investment formed by&nbsp;outgrowths from the adjacent vegetative cells; a cellular&nbsp;investment is formed in the same way round the fertilized&nbsp;procarpium in most Florideae, and round the fertilized&nbsp;ascogonium in the Ascomycetes. The most familiar case&nbsp;of fruit-formation is that occurring in the Phanerogams;&nbsp;here in many instances the carpels, in some the floral&nbsp;leaves of the perianth, and in some the floral receptacle&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(torus)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> grow actively after the fertilization of the oospheres&nbsp;has taken place, giving rise to a mass of succulent&nbsp;parenchymatous tissue. In the Orchidese the development of the ovules does not take place at all until the&nbsp;flower has been pollinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Germination of the Spores and Alternation of Generations. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The spores of plants may either germinate immediately&nbsp;on their production, or they may undergo a· longer or&nbsp;shorter period of quiescence; those which are destined for&nbsp;immediate germination have, as described above, a thii&nbsp;cell-wall, whereas those which are capable of undergoing&nbsp;a period of quiescence have a thick cell-wall. In som!&nbsp;cases the spores are incapable of immediate germination&nbsp;notably sexually produced spores; for instance, amon¿&nbsp;the Algae, immediate germination is only known to tak&lt;&nbsp;place in the case of the zygospores of Botrydium anc&nbsp;Ectocarpus, and of the oospore of Fucus; among th&lt;&nbsp;Fungi the zygospores of the Mucorini and the oospores ol&nbsp;the Peronosporese and Saprolegnieae pass through a perioc&nbsp;of quiescence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The mode of germination is not always the same. Ir most cases the spore gives rise directly to a new organism,&nbsp;either by protruding one or more filamentous outgrowths&nbsp;or by the division of its protoplasm to form the tissue o:&nbsp;the embryo. In some cases the spore behaves like £&nbsp;reproductive organ; from its protoplasm are formed £&nbsp;larger or smaller number of cells, either motile or non&nbsp;motile, which are set free. In Acetabularia, and undei&nbsp;certain circumstances in Botrydium, the asexually pro&nbsp;duced spore behaves like a sexual reproductive orgai&nbsp;(gametangium), giving rise to a number of planogametes&nbsp;similarly the spore of Protomyces produces within itself £&nbsp;number of conjugating sporidia. In some Peronosporea&nbsp;(always in Cystopus; occasionally, according to circum&nbsp;stances, in Pythium, Phytophthora, and Peronospora) th(&nbsp;asexually produced spore behaves like a sporangium, anc&nbsp;gives rise to a number of zoospores from each of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">new individual is developed. This happens occasionally&nbsp;also in sexually produced spores. Among the Fungi, th(&nbsp;formation of zoospores in the oospore occurs in various&nbsp;species of Peronosporeae and Saprolegnieae. Among the&nbsp;Algae, zoospores are formed in the zygospores of Pandorina&nbsp;and Ulothrix, and in the oospores of (Edogonium and&nbsp;Sphaeroplea. Cases of a similar kind are known also in&nbsp;the Phanerogams; thus in some Coniferae, and notably in&nbsp;the Gnetaceous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ephedra altissima,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a process of cell-formation goes on in the oospore, resulting in the formation of a&nbsp;a larger or smaller number of cells from each of which an&nbsp;embryo plant is developed. These cases, in which, namely,&nbsp;the spore, whether sexually or asexually produced, gives&nbsp;rise to a number of cells, each of which is capable, by itself,&nbsp;of developing into a new individual, are instances of whal&nbsp;is known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">polyembryony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In some cases the cells formed in the sexually produced spore dc not each give rise to a new individual; this obtains in the Hydro-dictyese. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hydrodictyon utricidatum</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the protoplasm of the&nbsp;zygospore gives rise to two or four large zoospores which eventually come to rest and remain quiescent for several months ; these&nbsp;resting spores are termed, on account of their form, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">polyhedra.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">On germination, the protoplasm of the polyhedron gives rise to a&nbsp;number of small zoospores, the endospore protruding as a delicate&nbsp;vesicle, within which the zoospores are in active movement; the&nbsp;zoospores eventually come to rest, without escaping from the endospore, and arrange themselves so as to form the meshes of a&nbsp;small sac-like net, which is a young Hydrodictyon ; the endospore&nbsp;is then disorganized, and the young net is set free a^ an independent ccenobium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Occasionally it happens that a portion only of the spore gives rise to the embryo. This is the case in the sexually produced&nbsp;spores (oospores) of the Characese, and in those of the Coniferae;&nbsp;in Selaginella and in the Angiospermous Phanerogams one-half oi&nbsp;the oospore gives rise to a filamentous structure, the suspensor, the&nbsp;other half to the main body of the embryo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is very commonly the case that the spore, on germination, gives rise to an organism unlike that by which the spore was produced. In a Moss, for example, the asexually produced spores are developed by an organism, the&nbsp;sporogonium, consisting typically of a longer or shorter&nbsp;stalk, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">seta,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> bearing a capsule </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(theca)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which produces&nbsp;the spores. When one of these spores germinates, it does&nbsp;not give rise to another sporogonium, but to an inconspicuous, usually filamentous, structure, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">protonema,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
