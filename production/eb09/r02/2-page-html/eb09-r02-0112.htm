<p><span class="font1">suggested for his trial lecture, that “ On the Hypotheses which form the Foundation of Geometry ” was chosen at the instance of Gauss, who was curious to hear&nbsp;what so young a man had to say on this difficult subject,&nbsp;on which he himself had in private speculated so profoundly (see Parallels, vol. xviii. p. 254). Dedekind&nbsp;tells us that Riemann’s lecture, which surpassed his&nbsp;utmost expectation, filled him with the greatest astonishment, and that on the way back from the faculty meeting&nbsp;he spoke to Wilhelm Weber with the highest appreciation, and with an excitement rare with him, regarding&nbsp;the depth of the thoughts to which Riemann had given&nbsp;utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1855 Gauss died and was succeeded by Dirichlet, who along with others made an effort to obtain Riemann’s&nbsp;nomination as extraordinary professor. In this they were&nbsp;not successful ; but a Government Stipendium of 200&nbsp;thalers was given him, and even this miserable pittance&nbsp;was of great importance, so straitened were his circumstances. But this small beginning of good fortune was&nbsp;embittered by the deaths of his father and his eldest&nbsp;sister, and by the breaking up of the home at Quickborn,&nbsp;where he had so often found solace when ill and dejected.&nbsp;Meantime he was lecturing and writing the great memoir&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Borchardtfi Journal,</span><span class="font1"> vol. liv., 1857) in which he applied&nbsp;the theory developed in his doctor’s dissertation to the&nbsp;Abelian functions. It is amusing to find him speaking&nbsp;jubilantly of the unexpectedly large audience of eight&nbsp;which assembled to hear his first lecture (in 1854) on&nbsp;partial differential equations and their application to&nbsp;physical problems. The rustic shyness which had troubled&nbsp;his schoolboyhood seems still to have haunted him ; for he&nbsp;says, speaking of these lectures, “ The nervousness which I&nbsp;had at first has pretty well subsided, and I accustom myself to think more of my hearers than of myself, and to&nbsp;read in their faces whether I may go on, or whether the&nbsp;matter requires further explanation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Riemann’s health had never been strong. Even in his boyhood he had shown symptoms of consumption, the&nbsp;disease that was working such havoc in his family ; and&nbsp;now under the strain of work he broke down altogether,&nbsp;and had to retire to the Harz with his friends Ritter&nbsp;and Dedekind, where he gave himself up to excursions&nbsp;and “ Naturphilosophie.” After his return to Göttingen&nbsp;(November 1857) he was made extraordinary professor, and&nbsp;his salary raised to three hundred thalers. As usual with&nbsp;him, misfortune followed close behind ; for he lost in quick&nbsp;succession his brother Wilhelm and another sister. In&nbsp;1859 he lost his friend Dirichlet; but his reputation was&nbsp;now so well established that he was at once appointed to&nbsp;succeed him. It now seemed for a little as if the world&nbsp;was to go smoothly with him. Well-merited honours&nbsp;began to reach him ; and in 1860 he visited Paris, and&nbsp;met with a warm reception there. He married, and&nbsp;married happily, Fräulein Elise Koch in June 1862, but&nbsp;the following month he had an attack of pleurisy which&nbsp;proved the beginning of a long illness that ended only with&nbsp;his death. His physician recommended a sojourn in Italy,&nbsp;for the benefit of his health, and Weber and Sartorius von&nbsp;Waltershausen obtained from the Government leave of&nbsp;absence and means to defray the cost of the journey. At&nbsp;first it seemed that he would recover ; but on his return&nbsp;in June 1863 he caught cold on the Splügen Pass, and in&nbsp;August of the same year had to go back to Italy. In&nbsp;November 1865 he returned again to Göttingen, but,&nbsp;although he was able to live through the winter, and even&nbsp;to work a few hours every day, it became clear to his&nbsp;friends, and clearest of all to himself, that he was dying.&nbsp;He was very desirous to finish some of the many investigations which had presented themselves to him, and&nbsp;eagerly asked his doctors to tell him how long he might&nbsp;reasonably expect to live, so that he might take up what&nbsp;he had most chance of finishing. In order to husband his&nbsp;few remaining days he resolved in June 1866 to return&nbsp;once more to Italy. Thither he journeyed through the&nbsp;confusion of the first days of the Austro-Prussian war, and&nbsp;settled in a villa at Selasca near Intra on Lago Maggiore.&nbsp;Here his strength rapidly ebbed away, but his mental&nbsp;faculties remained brilliant to the last. On the 19th of&nbsp;July 1866, attended by his wife, he lay under a fig-tree&nbsp;greatly enjoying the beautiful landscape and working at his&nbsp;last unfinished investigation on the mechanism of the ear.&nbsp;The day following he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are few more pathetic stories than the life of Riemann, few finer instances of victory gained by inborn&nbsp;genius over a host of adverse circumstances. Few as were&nbsp;the years of work allotted to him, and few as are the&nbsp;printed pages covered by the record of his researches, his&nbsp;name is, and will remain, a household word among mathematicians. Most of his memoirs are masterpieces—full of&nbsp;original methods, profound ideas, and far-reaching imagination. Few sources, we imagine, have been fuller of inspiration for the younger mathematicians of our day than the&nbsp;octavo volume of five hundred pages or so that contains his&nbsp;works ; and many an advance in mathematical science&nbsp;will yet be made, with increase of reputation to the maker,&nbsp;by carrying out his suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The collected works of Riemann were published by IL Weber assisted by R. Dedekind (8vo, Leipsic, 1876). At the end of this&nbsp;volume there is a touching account of his life by the latter, from&nbsp;which the above sketch is almost entirely taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. CH.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIESENER, Jean Henri (1725-1806), the celebrated cabinet-maker of Louis XVI., was born at Gladbeck near&nbsp;Cologne in 1725. He was employed by Jean François&nbsp;Oeben in the arsenal, and in 1769 married Oeben’s widow,&nbsp;by whom he had one son. A number of fine examples&nbsp;of Riesener’s cabinets are described in the catalogue of&nbsp;furniture in the South Kensington Museum. He employed&nbsp;tulip, rosewood, holly, maple, laburnum, and purple wood&nbsp;in their construction. Wreaths and bunches of flowers&nbsp;form the centres of his panels ; on the sides are diaper&nbsp;patterns in quiet colours. The name of Riesener is&nbsp;stamped sometimes on the panel itself, sometimes on the&nbsp;oak lining of the furniture made by him. The best pieces&nbsp;at the South Kensington Museum are from the collection&nbsp;of Sir Richard Wallace ; perhaps the most remarkable is&nbsp;the bureau made for Stanislaus, king of Poland, which&nbsp;is signed by the maker, as is also a similar piece in the&nbsp;Louvre which is accompanied by gilt bronze candle&nbsp;branches by Gouthière. This last work, which bears the&nbsp;date 1769, it is believed that Riesener only finished; and&nbsp;indeed towards the close of his life, after his second&nbsp;marriage (1782) to Marie A. C. Grezel (from whom he&nbsp;was divorced), he ceased to produce anything, and became&nbsp;a collector, buying up his own works. He died January&nbsp;6, 1806. His son, Henri François (1767-1828), was&nbsp;one of the most noted portrait-painters of the first empire.&nbsp;The portrait of M. Ravrio, a worker in bronze (Louvre),&nbsp;is a good example of his talent.</span></p>
