<hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre</hi> (1699-1749), French painter, who passed nearly his whole life at Rome, was born at Uzès (Gard) in 1699. He left France for Italy in 1728, having carried off the great prize. He there painted for the canons of Asti Christ’s Visit to the House of Simon the Pharisee (Louvre, engraved by Subleyras himself), a large work, which made his reputation and procured his admission into the Academy of St Luke. Cardinal Valenti Gonzaga next obtained for him the order for Saint Basil and the Emperor Valens (small study in Louvre), which was executed in mosaic for St Peter’s. Benedict XIV. and all the princes of Rome sat to him, and the pope himself commanded two great paintings—the Marriage of St Catherine and the Ecstasy of St Camilla—which he placed in his private apartments. For various religious corporations at Milan, Perugia, and other places, and for various great persons many important altar-pieces were also executed; but Subleyras shows greater individuality in his curious genre pictures, which he produced in considerable number (Louvre). It is in his illustrations of La Fontaine and Boccaccio that his true relation to the modern era comes out ; and his drawings from nature are often admirable for their grave sobriety of treatment (see one of a man draped in a heavy cloak in the British Museum). Exhausted by overwork, Subleyras tried a change to Naples, but returned to Rome at the end of a few months to die (28th May 1749). His wife, the celebrated miniature painter, Maria Felice Tibaldi, was sister to the wife of Trémollière.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
