rannical than this was never made by an eastern despot; and when it was sirst published, foreigners were at a loss whether to regard it as a sublime effort of a power full government, or as a wild project which could pro duce nothing but confusion. The effects of it, how ever, have been truly terrible, we have already men tioned some of them in the bloody contest which oc curred upon the Rhine, and Europe was soon destined to bear witness to still more extraordinary events. 
In the end of July, general Custine was brought to trial, and executed, in consequence of a variety of ac cusations of infidelity to his trust and disrespect to the convention. The queen was next brought to trial before the revolutionary tribunal, on the 15th of octo ber. The charges against her were very various; but the chief tendency of them was to prove that she had always been hostile to the revolution, and liad excited all the efforts that had been made by the court against it. On the 16th of October, this beautiful woman, whom fortune once placed so high, ended her days on a scaffold, after a mock trial, in which no regard was paid either to justice or decency. she behaved with much dignity and composure, and appeared deeply impressed with a sense of religion. The members of the 1 convention who had been at the head of the Girondist party, and had either been detained in prison since the ist of May, or seized in the departments to which they had retired, were afterwards brought to trial. On the 30th of October, 2 1 of them were executed, viz. Briffot, Vergniaud, Gensonne, Duprat, Lehardi, D ucos, Fonfrede, Boileau, Gardien, Duchatel, sillery, Fauchet, Dufriche, Duperret, La source, Carra, beau vais, Mainville, Antiboul, Vigée, and Lacaze. seventy one were still detained in confinement. The duke of Orleans was afterwards condemned, on a charge of having aspired to the sovereignty from the beginning of the revolution. His execution gave satisfaction to all parties. His vote for the punishment of death upon the trial of the late king had done him little honour even in the opinion of the Mountain, and had rendered him odious to all the rest of mankind. 
The executions of persons of all ranks, particularly of priests and nobles, became now so common, that it would be in vain to attempt to give any detail of them. Every person brought before the revolutionary tribunal was condemned as a matter of course. The Jacobins seemed insatiable in their thirst after blood, and the people at large appeared to regard their conduct with unaccountable indifference. 
: when the human mind is once roused, its activity extends to every object. At this time a new table of weights and measures was established by the convention, in which the decimal arithmetic alone is employed. The court of spain had the liberality, notwith standing the war, to suffer M. Mechain to proceed in his operations for measuring a degree of the meridian in that country. He carried on his series of triangles from Barcelona to Perpignan; and from this place the mensuration was continued to Paris. M. de Lambre, and his pupil M. le Francois, also measured a degree of latitude in the vicinity of the metropolis. In all, 12 degrees of the meridian were measured; of which the mean is 57027 toises, and by this the universal standard of measure is calculated. M. M. de Borde and Cassini determined the length 
of a pendulum that swings southeast 
conds, 
in vacuo 
and in a mean temperature at Paris, to be 3 seet and 8, 06 lines. Μ. M. Lavoisier and Hauy sound that a cubic foot of distilled water at the freezing point weighs 
in vacuo 
70 pounds and 60 gros French weight, we shall insert a table of the measures and weights now established.
