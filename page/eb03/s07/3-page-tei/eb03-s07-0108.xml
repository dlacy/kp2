Theſe were immediately beſieged by Icetas and the Carthaginians, but Timoleon found means to relieve them in ſpite of all oppoſition ; and having diſperſed emiſſaries through the army of Mago the Carthaginian general, exhorting the mercenary Greeks to forſake him, he was ſo much intimidated, that in ſpite of all the remonstrances Icetas could make, he ſet ſail for Africa, leaving his colleague to carry on the war in the beſt manner he could.</p><p>The day after the departure of Mago, Timoleon aſſaulted the city ſo briſkly, that the troops of Icetas were driven from the walls, and the Corinthians became masters of the place. Timoleon, by sound of trumpet, invited the inhabitants to come and aſſiſt in demoliſhing the citadel and other caſtles, which he called the ne<hi rend="italic">sts of tyrants ;</hi> after which he cauſed edifices to be erected in the place where the citadel had ſtood, for the adminiſtration of juſtice. He found the city in a moſt miſerable ſituation : for many having periſhed in the wars and seditions, and others having fled to avoid the oppreſſion of tyrants, Syracuse, once ſo wealthy and populous, was now become almoſt a deſert ; inſomuch that the horſes were fed on the graſs which grew on the market-place. Timoleon ſupplied the city with inhabitants from Corinth and other cities of Greece, at the ſame time that great multitudes from Italy and the other parts of Sicily reſorted thither. Timoleon diſtributed the lands among them <hi rend="italic">gratis ;</hi> but. fold the houſes, and with the money ariſing from the ſale eſtabliſhed a fund for the ſupport of the poor. Having thus reſtored Syracuſe, he in like manner delivered all the Greek cities of Sicily from the tyrants who had taken poſſeſſion of them, all of whom he put to death. After this he resigned his authority, and led a retired life, honoured in the higheſt degree by the Syracusians, and by all the cities in Sicily. After his death he was honoured as a god ; the expence of his funeral was defrayed by the public; ſports, with horſe-races and gymnaſtic exerciſes, were held annually on the day of his death ; and it was decreed, that whenever the Syracusians were at war with the barbarians, they ſhould ſend to Corinth for a general.</p><p>For 20 years the Syracusians enjoyed the fruits of Timoleon’s victories ; but new diſturbances ariſing, in a ſhort time another tyrant ſtarted uρ, who exceeded all that had gone before him in cruelty and other vices. This was the celebrated Agathocles, of whoſe exploits againſt the Carthaginians a full account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage, </hi>n⁰ 33—53. He was poiſoned by one Moenon in the year 289 B. C. after having reigned 28 years, and lived 95.— A ſucceſſion of tyrants followed, till at laſt the city, being held by two rivals, Tœnion and Soſiſtratus, who made war within the very walls, Pyrrhus king of Epirus was invited into Sicily, in order to put an end to theſe distractions. He willingly complied with the invitation ; and was everywhere received with loud acclamations, as the deliverer not only of Syracuſe, but of all Sicily. As he had a fine army of 30,000 foot and 5000 horſe, with a fleet of 200 ſail, he drove the Carthaginians from place to place, till he left them only the two ſtrong poſts of Eryx and Lilybæum. The former of theſe he took by aſſault, and was himſelf the firſt man who mounted the walls, after having killed a great number of Africans with his own hand. The Mamertines likewiſe, who had conquered a conſiderable part of the iſland, were everywhere defeated and driven out, till at laſt they were ſhut up in the city of Messana. The Carthaginians, alarmed at the rapidity of his conquests, ſent ambasſadors with propoſals of peace upon very advantageous terms ; but Pyrrhus, puffed up with the expectation of reducing the whole iſland, refuſed to hearken to any terms unleſs they would inſtantly abandon it. So firm was he in the belief of this, that he cauſed his son take upon him the title of <hi rend="italic">king of Sicily ;</hi> but in the mean time, having diſpleaſed the Sicilians by his arbitrary behaviour, they deſerted from him in ſuch numbers that he was glad to ſet out for Italy, for which retreat the embaſſies he received from the Samnites, Tarentines, and other Italians, furnished him with an honourable pretext. He embarked in the ſhips which he had brought with him from Italy ; but was met at ſea by the Carthaginians, who sunk 70 of his veſſels, and diſperſed or took the reſt ; ſo that he ſaved himſelf in Italy only with 12 vesſels, the poor remains of a fleet of 200 ſail. No ſooner were the Mamertines appriſed of his departure, than they diſpatched a body of 18,000 men to haraſs him after his landing. Theſe, having paſſed the ſtraits before him, posted themſelves in the road which Pyrrhus must take in marching by land to Tarentum ; and concealing themſelves among woods and rocks, attacked him unexpectedly, and with great reſolution. But Pyrrhus behaved on this occasion with his uſual bravery. The attack being made on his rear, he haſtened thither, and made a dreadful slaughter of the enemy, till a wound on his head obliged him to retire. As he was ſuppoſed to be diſabled by this wound, a proud Mamertine, of an extraordinary ſize, and ſhining in bright armour, advanced, and with a loud voice challenged the king of Epirus, if he was yet alive, to a single combat. Pyrrhus immediately turned about, and making a dreadful appearance by reaſon of the blood which ran down his face, flew at this new champion, on whoſe head he diſcharged ſuch a furious blow, that he cleft his body aſunder ; one half falling to the right, and the other to the left. This incredible feat, which has ſince been aſcribed to other warriors, perhaps with as much truth as to Pyrrhus, ſo much intimidated the Mamertines, that they allowed his troops to continue their march unmoleſted.</p><p>After the departure of Pyrrhus, Hiero the ſon of Hierocles, a deſcendant of Gelon the firſt king of Syracuſe, was choſen general of the forces, along with another named Ar<hi rend="italic">temidorus.</hi> The two gcnerals had nothing more at heart than to put an end to the confusion and diſorder which reigned in the city ; for which reaſon they entered it at the head of their forces. On this occaſion Hiero diſcovered extraordinary talents for government. By mere dint of insinuation and addreſs, without ſhedding blood, or hurting a single citizen, he calmed the minds of the people ; reconciled the factions ; and ſo gained the affections of all, that he was inveſted with the whole civil as well as military power in the ſtate. Soon after this, he married the daughter of one of the firſt citizens ; and having distinguiſhed himſelf by his exploits againſt the Mamertines, was unanimouſly elected king of Syracuſe, in the year 265 B. C.</p><p>Some time after Hiero’s acceſſion to the throne, he again defeated the Mamertines, and reduced them to ſuch ſtraits, that they were obliged to call in the Romans to their aſſiſtance. The conſequences of this have been fully related under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage,</hi> Hiero, who had allied himſelf with the Carthaginians, being himſelf defeated by the Romans, and finding his allies unable to protect him againſt the power of that republic, concluded an alliance with them ; and continued faithful to them even in the time of the ſecond Punic war, when they were in the greateſt diſtreſs. In his reign flouriſhed the celebrated mathematid cian Archimedes, whoſe genius he employed in fortifying</p></body></text></TEI>
