Pop. (1906), 28,016. St Maur and the residential 'district surrounding it cover a peninsula formed by a loop in the Marne, the neck of which is crossed by the canal of St Maur. In the reign of Clovis II. the monastery of Les Fossés was founded; the amplification of the name came when the body of St Maurus was brought there by the monks of St Maur-sur-Loire. About the same time was inaugurated the pilgrimage of Notre-Dame des Miracles, which still takes place annually. In 1465 a treaty of peace, putting an end to the “ War of the Public Weal,” was concluded between Louis XI. and his revolted barons at St Maur.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
