a term of relation, signifying a person who owes and pays obedience for a certain time to another in quality of a master.</p><p>The first sort of servants acknowledged by the laws of England are menial servants, so called from being <hi rend="italic">intra mœnia,</hi> or domestics. The contract between them and their masters arises upon the hiring.</p><p>Another species of servants are called apprentices, from <hi rend="italic">apprendre,</hi> to learn ; and are usually bound for a term of years, by deed indented, or indentures, to serve their musters, and be maintained and instructed by them.</p><p>A third species of servants are labourers, who are only hired by the day or the week, and do not live <hi rend="italic">intra mœnia,</hi> as part of the family.</p><p>There is yet a fourth species of servants, if they may be so called, being rather in a superior or ministerial capacity, such as stewards, factors, and bailiffs ; whom, however, the law considers as servants <hi rend="italic">pro tempore,</hi> with regard to such of their acts as affect their master’s or employer’s property.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
