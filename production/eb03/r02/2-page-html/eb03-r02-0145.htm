<p><span class="font0">frightened at the ſtrange noiſe they made, either threw their riders, or carried them on full ſpeed in ſpite of&nbsp;their utmoſt efforts. In the mean time, the archers,&nbsp;diſeharging ſhowers of darts from the towers, wounded&nbsp;ſeveral of the Romans in that confuſion, while others&nbsp;were trod to death by the elephants. Notwithſtanding&nbsp;the diſorder of the cavalry, the legionaries ſtill kept&nbsp;their ranks, and could not be broken, till Pyrrhus attacked them in perſon at the head of the Theſſalian&nbsp;horſe. The onſet was ſo furious, that they were' forced&nbsp;to yield, and retire in diſorder. The king of Epirus&nbsp;reſtrained the ardour of his troops, and would not ſuffer them to purſeie the enemy ; an elephant, which had&nbsp;been wounded by a Roman ſoldier named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Minucius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">having cauſed a great diſorder in his army, this accident favoured the retreat of the Romans, and gave&nbsp;them time to repaſs the river, and take refuge in Apulia. The Epirot remained maſter of the field, and had&nbsp;the pleaſure to ſee the Romans fly before him : but the&nbsp;victory coſt him dear, a great number of his beſt officers and ſoldiers having been ſlain in the battle ; whence&nbsp;he was heard to ſay after the action, that he was both&nbsp;conqueror and conquered, and that if he gained ſuch&nbsp;another victory, lie ſhould be obliged to return to Epirus alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His firſt care after the action was to bury the dead, with which the plain was covered ; and herein he&nbsp;ιn⅜c no diſtinction between the Romans and his own&nbsp;Epirots. In viewing the bodies of the former, he obſerved, that none of them had received diſhonourable&nbsp;wounds ; that they had all fallen in the polls aſſigned&nbsp;them, ſtill held their ſwords in their hands, and ſhowed, even after death, a certain martial air and ſierce-neſs in their faces ; and on this occaſion it was that he&nbsp;uttered thoſe famous words : “ O that Pyrrhus had&nbsp;the Romans for his ſoldiers, or the Romans Pyrrhus&nbsp;ſor their leader ! together, we ſhould ſubdue the whole&nbsp;world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The king of Epirus underſtood the art of war too well not to reap what advantage he could from his victory. He broke into the countries in alliance with the&nbsp;Romans, plundered the lands of the republic, and made&nbsp;incurſions even into the neighbourhood of Rome. Many cities opened their gates to him, and in a ſhort time&nbsp;he made himſelf maſter of the greateſt part of Campania. While he was in that fruitful province, ſubſiſting&nbsp;his troops there at the expence of the Romans, he was&nbsp;joined by the Samnites, Lucanians, and Meſſapians,&nbsp;whom he had ſo long expected. After having reproached them ſor their delay, he gave them a good&nbsp;ſhare of the ſpoils he had taken from the enemy ; and&nbsp;having by this means gained their affections, he marched without loſs of time to lay ſiege to Capua : but Lævinus, having already received a reinforcement of two&nbsp;legions, threw ſome troops into the city ; which obliged&nbsp;Pyrrhus to drop his deſign, and, leaving Capua, to&nbsp;march ſtraight to Naples Lævinus followed him, ha&nbsp;raffing his troops on their march ; and at length, by&nbsp;keeping his army in the neighbourhood, forced him to&nbsp;give over all thoughts of making himſelf maſter of that&nbsp;important city. The king then, all on a ſudden, took&nbsp;his route towards Rome by the Latin way, ſurpriſed&nbsp;Fregellæ, and, marching through the country of the&nbsp;Hernici, ſat down before Piænefte. There, from the&nbsp;top of an hill, he had the pleaſure of ſeeing Rome j and&nbsp;is ſaid to have advanced ſo near the walls, that he drove&nbsp;a cloud of duſt into the city. But he was ſoon forced&nbsp;to retire by the other conſul T. Coruncanius, who,&nbsp;having reduced Hetruria, was juſt then returned with&nbsp;his victorious army to Rome. The king of Epirus,&nbsp;therefore, having no hopes of bringing the Hetrurians&nbsp;into his intereſt, and ſeeing two conſular armies ready&nbsp;to fall upon him, raiſed the ſiege of Præneite, and&nbsp;haſtened back into Campania ; where, to his great ſurpriſe, lie found Lævinus with a more numerous army&nbsp;than that which he had defeated on the banks of the&nbsp;Siris. The conſul went to meet him, with a deſign&nbsp;to try the fate of another battle ; which Pyrrhus being unwilling to decline, drew up his army, and, to&nbsp;ſtrike terror into the Roman legions, ordered his men&nbsp;to beat their bucklers with their lances, and the leaders of the elephants to force them to make a hideous&nbsp;noiſe. But the noiſe was returned with ſuch an univerſal ſhout by the Romans, that Pyrrhus, thinking ſo&nbsp;much alacrity on the part of the vanquiſhed too ſure a&nbsp;prognoſtic of victory, altered his mind ; and, pretending&nbsp;that the auguries were not favourable, retired to Tarentum, and put an end to the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Pyrrhus continued quiet at Tarentum, he had time to reflect on the valour and conduct of the&nbsp;Romans ; which made him conclude, that the war in&nbsp;which he was engaged muſt end in his ruin and diſgrace, if not terminated by an advantageous peace.&nbsp;He was therefore overjoyed when he heard that the&nbsp;ſenate had determined to ſend an honourable embaſſy&nbsp;to him, not doubting but their errand' was to propoſe&nbsp;terms of peace. The ambaſſadors were three men of&nbsp;diſtinguiſhed merit ; to wit, Cornelius Dolabella, who&nbsp;was famous for the ſignal victory he had gained over&nbsp;the Senones, Fabrſeius, and Æmilius Pappus, who had&nbsp;been his colleague in the conſulate two years before.&nbsp;When they were admitted to an audience, the only&nbsp;thing they iſemanded was a ſurrender of the priſoners, either by the way of exchange, or at ſuch a ranſom as ſhould be agreed on ; ſor Pyrrhus, in the late&nbsp;battle, had made 1800 priſoners, moſt of them Roman knights and men of diſtinction in the republic.&nbsp;They had ſought with great bravery, till their horſes,&nbsp;frightened with the roaring of the king’s elephants,&nbsp;had either thrown them, or obliged them to diſmount ;&nbsp;by which unforeſeen accident they had fallen into the&nbsp;enemy’s hands. The ſenate, therefore, pitying the&nbsp;condition of thoſe brave men, had determined, contrary to their cuſtom, to redeem them. Pyrrhus was&nbsp;greatly ſurpriſed and diſappointed when he found that&nbsp;they had no other propoſals to make ; but, concealing his thoughts, he only anſwered, that he would,&nbsp;conſider of it, and let them know his reſolution. Accordingly, he aſſembled his council : but his chief </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">favourites</span><span class="font0"> were divided in their opinions. Milo, who&nbsp;commanded in the citadel of Tarentum, was ſor coming to no compoſition with the Romans ; but Cy-neas, who knew his matter’s inclination, propoſed not&nbsp;only ſending back the priſoners without ranſem, but&nbsp;diipatching an embaſſy to Rome to treat with the&nbsp;ſenate of a laſting peace. His advice was approved,&nbsp;and he himſelf appointed to go on that embaſſy. After theſe reſolutions, the king acquainted the ambaſſadors, that he intended to releaſe the priſoners without&nbsp;ranſom, ſince he had already riches enough, and de-</span></p>
