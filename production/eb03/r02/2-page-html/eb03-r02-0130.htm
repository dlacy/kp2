<p><span class="font0">it was foggctted to them, 'that what could not be effected by the interceſſion öf the ſenate or the adjuration of the prieſts, might b⅞ brought about by the tears of&nbsp;his wife, or the commands of his mother. This deputation ſeemed to be reliſhed by all ; and even the ſenate&nbsp;itſelf gave it the fonction öf their authority. Vettnfia,&nbsp;the mother of Coriolanus, at firſt made ſome hesitation&nbsp;to undertake ſo pious a work : however, ſhe at laſt undertook the embaſſy, ând ſet forward from the city, accompanied by many of the principal matrons of Rome,&nbsp;with Vol<sup>,</sup>umnia his wiſe, and his two children. Coriolanus, who at â diſtance diſcovered this mournful train&nbsp;of females, was reſolved to give them à denial, and&nbsp;called his officers round him to be witneſs of his reſolution ; but, 'when told that his mother and his wiſe&nbsp;were among the number, he inſtantly came down from&nbsp;his tribunal to meet and embrace them. At firſt, the&nbsp;womens tears and embraces took away the power of&nbsp;words ; and the rough ſoldier himſelf, hard as he was,&nbsp;could not refrain from ſharing in their diſtreſs. Coriolanus now ſeemed much agitated by contending paſſions ; while his mother, who ſaw him moved, ſeconded&nbsp;her words by the moſt perſuaſive eloquence, her tears ;&nbsp;his wife and children hung round him, intreating for&nbsp;protection and pity ; while the fair tram, her comp¾-nio'ns, added their lamentations, and deplored their own&nbsp;and their country’s diſtreſs. Coriolanus for a moment&nbsp;wa's filent, feeling the ſtrong conflict between honour&nbsp;and inclination : at length, as if routed from his dream,&nbsp;he flew to take up his mother, who had fallen at his&nbsp;feet, crying out, &quot; O my mother, thou haft ſaved&nbsp;Rome, but loſt thy ſon.” He accordingly gave orders&nbsp;to draw off the army, pretending to the officers that&nbsp;the city was too ſtrong to be taken. Tullus, who had&nbsp;long envied ſhis glory, was not remiſs in aggravating&nbsp;the lenity of ſhis conduct to his countrymen. Upon&nbsp;their return, Coriolanus was ſlain in an inſurrection of&nbsp;the people, arid afterwards honourably buried, With late&nbsp;and ineffectual repentance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The year following, the two conſuls of the former year, Manlius and Fabius, were cited by the tribunes&nbsp;to appear before the people. The Agrarian law,&nbsp;which had been propoſed ſome time before, for equally&nbsp;dividing the lands of the commonwealth among the&nbsp;people, was the object invariably purſued, and they&nbsp;were accuſed of having made unjuſtifiable delays inputting it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It ſeems the Agrarian law was a grant the ſenate could not think of giving up to the people. The conſuls, therefore, made many delays and excuſes, till at&nbsp;length they were once more obliged to have recourſe&nbsp;to a dictator ; and they fixed upon Quintus Cincinna-tιιs, a man who had for ſome time given up all views of&nbsp;ambition, and retired to his little farm, where the deputies of the ſenate found him holding the plough, and&nbsp;dreſſed in the mean attire of a labouring huſhandman.&nbsp;Fie appeared but little elevated with the addreſſes of&nbsp;Λ,∙eιemon.y and the pompous habits they Brought him ;&nbsp;and, upon declaring to him the ſenate’s pleaſure, he teſtified rather a concern that his aid ſhould be w<sup>τ</sup>atιted.&nbsp;However, he departed for the city, where both parties&nbsp;were ſtrongly enſlamed againſt each other : but he was&nbsp;reſolved to ſide with neither; only, by a ſtri’ct attention&nbsp;lo the intereſts off his country, inſtead of gaming the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">confidence of </span><span class="font0">faction, to Obtain lire tſteem of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus, by threats and well-timed ſubmiſſion, he pre· vailed upon the tribunes to put off their law for a time,&nbsp;and carried himſelf ſo as to be a terror to the multitude&nbsp;whenever they reſuſed to enliſt ; and their greateſt encourager whenever their ſubmiſſion deſerved it. Thus,&nbsp;having reſtored that tranquillity to the people which&nbsp;he ſo much loved himſelf, he again gave up the lplen-d<sup>,</sup>ors of ambition, to enjoy it with a greater reliſh in his&nbsp;little farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cincinnatυs w<sup>,</sup>as not long retired from his office when a freſh exigence of the ſtate once more required his aſſiſtance* The Æqui and the Volſei, who, though ſtill&nbsp;worſted, ſtill were for renewing the war, made new inroads into the territories of Rome. Miιmtius, one of&nbsp;the conſuls who ſucceeded Cincinnatus, was ſent to oppoſe them ; but being naturally timid·, and rather more&nbsp;afraid of being conquered than défiions of victory, his&nbsp;army wηs driven into a defile between two mountains,&nbsp;from which, except through the enemy, there was no&nbsp;cgreſs. This, however, the Æqui had the precaution&nbsp;to fortify ; by which the Roman army was ſo hemmed&nbsp;in on every ſide, that nothing remained but ſubmiſſion&nbsp;to the enemy, famine, or immediate death. Some&nbsp;knights, v.ſho found means of getting away privately&nbsp;through the enemy’s camp, were the firſt that brought&nbsp;the account of this diſaſter to Rome. Nothing could&nbsp;exceed the conſternation of all ranks of people when informed of it. The ſenate at firſt thought of the other&nbsp;conſul ; but not having ſufficient experience of his abilities, they unaninouſly turned their eyes upon Cincin-natus, and reſolved to make him dictator. Cincinuatus,&nbsp;the only perſon on Wſhom Rome could now place her&nbsp;whole dependence, was found, as before, by the meſſengers of the ſenate, labouring in his little field with&nbsp;cheerful induſtry. He was at firſt aſtoniſhed at the enſigns of unbounded power with which the deputies*&nbsp;came to inveſt him ; but ſtill more at the approach or&nbsp;the principal of the ſenate, who came out to meet him.&nbsp;A dignity ſo unlooked for, however-, had no effect&nbsp;upon the ſimplicitv or the integrity of his manners :&nbsp;and being how poſſeſſed of abſolute powder, and called&nbsp;upon to nominate his maſter of the horſe, he choſe a&nbsp;poor man named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tarquitius, </span><span class="font0">one who, like himſelf,&nbsp;deſpiſed riches when they led to diſhonour. Upon&nbsp;entering the city, the dictator pυ'. on a ſerene look,&nbsp;and intreated all thoſe who were able to bear arms to&nbsp;repair before fun-ſet to the Campus Martius (the place&nbsp;where the levies were made) with neceſſary arms, and&nbsp;proviſions for five days. He put himſelf at the head öf&nbsp;theſe ; and, marching all night with great expedition,&nbsp;he arrived before day within fight of the enemy. Upon his approach, he ordered his ſoldiers to raiſe a loud&nbsp;ſhout, to apprize the conſul's army of the relief that&nbsp;w<sup>,</sup>as at hand. The Æqui w<sup>,</sup>tre not a little amazed&nbsp;when they ſaw themſelves between two enemies ; but&nbsp;ſtill more when they perceived Cincinnatus making the&nbsp;ſtrongeſt entrenchments -beyond them, to prevent their&nbsp;eſcape, and inclofιiιg them as they bad incloſed the conſul. To prevent this, a furious combat enfiιed ; but&nbsp;the Æqui, being attacked on both ſides, and unable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">refill or fly, begged a ceſſation of arms. They offered&nbsp;the dictator his own terms : he gave them their lives ;&nbsp;but obliged them, in token of ſervitude, to paſs under&nbsp;the yoke, which was two ſpears ſet upright-, and another acroſs, in the form of a gallows beneath which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
