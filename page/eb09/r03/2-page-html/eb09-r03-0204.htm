<p><span class="font1">who were now dominant in Servia and Walachia, offered Sultan Mahomet a yearly tribute of 2000 ducats. On his deposition, however, in 1458 by Stephen, known as “the Great,” Moldavia became&nbsp;a power formidable alike to Turk, Pole, and Hungarian. Throughout the long reign of this voivode, which lasted forty-six years, from&nbsp;1458 to 1504, his courage and resources never failed him. In the&nbsp;early part of his reign he appears, in agreement with the Turkish&nbsp;sultan and the king of Poland, turning out the Hungarian vassal,&nbsp;the ferocious Vlad, from the Walachian throne, and annexing the&nbsp;coast cities of Kilia and Cetatea Alba or Bielogorod, the Turkish&nbsp;Akierman. In the autumn of 1474 the sultan Mahomet entered&nbsp;IkIoldavia at the head of an army estimated by the Polish historian&nbsp;Dlugoss at 120,000 men. Voivode Stephen withdrew into the&nbsp;interior at the approach of this overwhelming host, but on January&nbsp;17, 1475, turned at bay on the banks of Lake Rakovietz and gained&nbsp;a complete victory over the Turks. Four pashas were among the&nbsp;slain ; over a hundred banners fell into the Moldavian hands ; and&nbsp;only a few survivors succeeded in reaching the Danube. In 1476&nbsp;Mahomct again entered Moldavia, thirsting for vengeance, but,&nbsp;though successful in the open field, the Turks were sorely harassed&nbsp;by Stephen’s guerilla onslaughts, and, being thinned by pestilence,&nbsp;were again constrained to retire. In 1484 the same tactics proved&nbsp;successful against an invasion of Bajazet. Three years later a Polish&nbsp;invasion of Moldavia under John Albert with 80,000 men ended in&nbsp;disaster, and shortly afterwards the voivode Stephen, aided by a&nbsp;Turkish and Tatar contingent, laid waste the Polish territories to&nbsp;the upper waters of the Vistula, and succeeded in annexing for a&nbsp;time the Polish province of Pokutia that lay between the Carpathians and the Dniester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Exclusive of this temporary acquisition, the Moldavian territory at this period extended from the river Milcov, which formed the&nbsp;boundary of Walachia, to the Dniester. It included the Carpathian&nbsp;region of the Bukovina, literally “ the beechwood,” where lay Sereth&nbsp;and Suciava, the earliest residences of the voivodes, the maritime&nbsp;district of Budzak (the later Bessarabia), with Kilia and Bielogorod,&nbsp;and the left bank of the lower Danube from Galatz to the Sulina&nbsp;mouth. The government, civil and ecclesiastical, was practically&nbsp;the same as that described in the case of Walachia, the officials&nbsp;bearing for the most part Slavonic titles derived from the practice&nbsp;of the Bulgaro-Vlachian czardom. The church was Orthodox&nbsp;Oriental, and depended from the patriarch of Ohrida. In official&nbsp;documents the language used was the old Slovene, the style of a&nbsp;Moldavian ruler being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Natchalnik i Voievoda Moldmlasi,</span><span class="font1"> prince&nbsp;and(duke (= Germ. “Fürst” and “Herzog”) of the Moldovlachs.&nbsp;The election of the voivodes, though in the hands of the boiars,&nbsp;was strictly regulated by hereditary principles, and Cantemir describes the extinction of the house of Dragosh in the 16th century&nbsp;as one of the unsettling causes that most contributed to the ruin&nbsp;of the country. The Moldavian army was reckoned 40,000 strong,&nbsp;and the cavalry arm was especially formidable. Verantius of&nbsp;Sebenico, an eye-witness of the state of Moldavia at the beginning&nbsp;of the 16th century, mentions three towns of the interior provided&nbsp;with stone walls—Suciava, Chotim, and Njamtz ; the people were&nbsp;barbarous, but more warlike than the Walachians and more tenacious of their national costume, punishing with death any who&nbsp;adopted the Turkish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1504 Stephen the Great died, and was succeeded by his son, Bogdan “the One-eyed.” At feud with Poland about Pokutia,&nbsp;despairing of efficacious support from hard-pressed Hungary, the&nbsp;new voivode saw no hope of safety except in a dependent alliance&nbsp;with the advancing Ottoman Power, which already hemmed&nbsp;Moklavia in on the Walachian and Crimean sides. In 1513 he&nbsp;agreed to pay an annual tribute to Sultan Selim in return for the&nbsp;sultan’s guarantee to preserve the national constitution and religion&nbsp;of Moldavia, to which country the Turks now gave the name of&nbsp;Kara Bogdan, from their first vassal. The terms of Moldavian submission were further regulated by a firman signed by Sultan&nbsp;Suleiman at Buda in 1529 by which the yearly present or “backshish,” as the tribute was euphoniously called, was fixed at 4000&nbsp;ducats, 40 horses, am⅛∙ 25 falcons, and the voivode was bound at&nbsp;need to supply the Turkish army with a contingent of a thousand&nbsp;men. The Turks pursued much the same policy as in Walachia.&nbsp;The tribute was gradually increased. A hold was obtained on the&nbsp;country by the occupation of various strongholds on Moldavian soil&nbsp;with the surrounding territory,—in 1538 Cetatea Alba (Akierman),&nbsp;in 1592 Bender, in 1702 Chotim (Khotin). Already by the middle&nbsp;of the 16th century the yoke was so heavy that the voivode Elias&nbsp;(1546-1551) became Mohammedan to avoid the sultan’s anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At this period occurs a curious interlude in Moldavian history. In 1561 the adventurer and impostor Jacob Basilicus succeeded&nbsp;with Hungarian help in turning out the voivode Alexander and&nbsp;. seizing on the reins of government. A Greek by birth, adopted&nbsp;son of Jacob Heraklides, despot of Paros, Samos, and other Ægean&nbsp;islands, acquainted with Greek and Latin literature, and master&nbsp;of most European languages, appearing alternately as a student of&nbsp;astronomy at Wittenberg, whither he had been invited by Count&nbsp;Mansfeld, as a correspondent of Melanchthon and as a writer of&nbsp;historical works which he dedicated to Philip II. of Spain, Basilicus,&nbsp;finding that his Ægean sovereignty </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in partibus</span><span class="font1"> was of little practical&nbsp;value beyond the crowning of poet laureates, fixed his roving ambition on a more substantial dominion. He published an astounding&nbsp;pedigree, in which, starting from “Hercules Triptolemus” ho&nbsp;wound his way through the royal Servian line to the kinship of&nbsp;Moldavian voivodes, and, having won the emperor Ferdinand and&nbsp;Albert Lasky to his financial and military support, succeeded,&nbsp;though at the head of only 1600 cavalry, in routing by a bold dash&nbsp;the vastly superior forces of the voivode, and even in purchasing&nbsp;the Turkish confirmation of his usurped title. He assumed the&nbsp;style of </span><span class="font0">Bα&lt;πλeus Moλδα∕3iαs, </span><span class="font1">and eluded the Turkish stipulation&nbsp;that he should dismiss his foreign guards. In Moldavia he&nbsp;appeared as a moral reformer, endeavouring to put down the prevalent vices of bigamy and divorce. He erected a school, placed it&nbsp;under a German master, and collected children from every part of&nbsp;the country to be maintained and educated at his expense. He&nbsp;also busied himself with the collection of a library. But his taxes&nbsp;—a ducat for each family—were considered heavy; his orthodoxy&nbsp;was suspected, his foreign counsellors detested. In 1563 the&nbsp;people rose, massacred the Hungarian guards, the foreign settlers,&nbsp;and finally Jacob himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The expelled voivode Alexander was now restored by the Porte, the schools w<sup>τ</sup>ere destroyed, and the country relapsed into its&nbsp;normal state of barbarism. His successor Ivonia was provoked&nbsp;by the Porte’s demand for 120,000 ducats as tribute instead of&nbsp;60,000 as heretofore to rise against the oppressor, but after gaining&nbsp;three victories he was finally defeated and slain (1574), and the&nbsp;country was left more than ever at the mercy of the Ottoman.&nbsp;Voivodes were now created and deposed in rapid succession by the&nbsp;Divan, but the victories of Michael the Bι<sup>,</sup>ave in Walachia infused&nbsp;a more independent spirit into the Moldavians. The Moldavian&nbsp;dominion was now disputed by the Transylvanians and Poles, and&nbsp;in 1600 Michael succeeded in annexing it to his “Great Dacian”&nbsp;realm. On Michael’s murder the Poles under Zamoyski again&nbsp;asserted their supremacy, but in 1618 the Porte once more recovered&nbsp;its dominion and set up successively two creatures of its own as&nbsp;voivodes—Gratiani, an Italian who had been Courtjeweller, and a&nbsp;Greek custom-house official, Alexander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in Walachia at a somewhat later date the Fanariote regime seemed now thoroughly established in Moldavia, and it became the&nbsp;rule that every three years the voivode should procure his confirmation by a large backshish, and every year by a smaller one. The&nbsp;prince Vasilje Lupul, however, an Albanian, who succeeded in&nbsp;1634, showed great abilities, and for twenty years succeeded in&nbsp;maintaining his position on the Moldavian throne. He introduced&nbsp;several internal reforms, codified the written and unwritten laws&nbsp;of the country, established a printing press, Greek monastic schools,&nbsp;and also a Latin school. He brought the Moldavian Church into&nbsp;more direct relation with the patriarch of Constantinople, but also&nbsp;showed considerable favour to the Latins, allowing them to erect&nbsp;churches at Suciava, Jassy, and Galatz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the wars between Sobieski and the Turks Moldavia found itself between hammer and anvil, and suffered frightfully moreover&nbsp;from Tatar devastations. The voivode Duka was forced like his&nbsp;Walachian contemporary to supply a contingent for the siege of&nbsp;Vienna in 1683. After Sobieski’s death in 1696, the hopes of&nbsp;Moldavia turned to the advancing Muscovite power. In 1711 the&nbsp;voivode Demetriu Cantemir, rendered desperate by the Turkish&nbsp;exactions, concluded an agreement with the czar Peter by which&nbsp;Moldavia was to become a protected and vassal state of Russia, with&nbsp;the enjoyment of its traditional liberties, the voivodeship to be&nbsp;hereditary in the family of Cantemir. On the approach of the&nbsp;Russian army the prince issued a proclamation containing the terms&nbsp;of the Russian protectorate and calling on the boiars and people to&nbsp;aid their Orthodox deliverers. But the iron had entered into the&nbsp;people’s soul. The long Turkish terrorism had done its work, and&nbsp;at the approach of a Turkish and Tatar host the greater part of the&nbsp;Moldavians deserted their voivode. The Russian campaign was&nbsp;unsuccessful, and all that Czar Peter could offer Cantemir and the&nbsp;boiars who had stood by him was an asylum on Russian soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his Russian exile Cantemir composed in a fair Latin style his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">DeSCriptio Moldaviæ,</span><span class="font1"> the counterpart so far as Moldavia is&nbsp;concerned to Del Chiaro’s contemporary description of Walachia.&nbsp;The capital of the country was now Jassy, to which city Stephen the&nbsp;Great had transferred his court from Suciava, the earlier residence&nbsp;of the voivodes. It had at this time forty churches—some of stone,&nbsp;some of wood. Fifty years before it had contained 12,000 houses,&nbsp;but Tatar devastations had reduced it to a third of its former&nbsp;size. The most important commercial emporium was the Danubian&nbsp;port of Galatz, which was frequented by vessels from the whole of&nbsp;the Levant from Trebizond to Barbary. The cargoes which they&nbsp;here took in consisted of Moldavian timber (oak, deal, and cornel),&nbsp;grain, butter, honey and wax, salt, and nitre ; Kilia at the north&nbsp;mouth of the Danube was also frequented by trading vessels,&nbsp;including Venetian and Ragusan. Moldavian wine was exported&nbsp;to Poland, Russia. Transylvania, and Hungary ; that of Cotnar was</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
