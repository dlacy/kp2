<p><span class="font0">Rhodes was famed in ancient times for its delightful climate, and it still maintains its former reputation. The&nbsp;air is pure and salubrious, and there is hardly a day throughout the year in which the sun is not visible. The winds&nbsp;are liable to little variation ; they blow from the west often&nbsp;with great violence for nine months in the year, and at&nbsp;other times from the north ; and they moderate the summer heats, which are chiefly felt during the months of July&nbsp;and August, when the hot winds blow from the coast of&nbsp;Caramania. There is no frost or snow during the winter,&nbsp;which is uncommonly mild and humid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes, in addition to its fine climate, is blessed with a fertile soil, and produces a variety of the finest fruits and&nbsp;vegetables; and if the industry of the inhabitants corresponded to their natural advantages, it might possess all the&nbsp;materials of wealth and commerce. But they have long&nbsp;groaned under the iron rod of Turkish oppression, by which&nbsp;those happy abodes are now converted into scenes of devastation. “ The gardens,” says Dr Clarke, @@<sup>1</sup> “ are filled&nbsp;with delicious fruit. Here, as in Cos, every gale is scented&nbsp;with the most powerful fragrance, which is wafted from&nbsp;groves of orange and citron trees. Numberless aromatic&nbsp;herbs exhale at the same time such profuse odour that the&nbsp;whole atmosphere seems impregnated with a spicy perfume.”&nbsp;A single river, named Candura, which name it gives to the&nbsp; cape in whose vicinity it discharges itself into the sea, waters&nbsp;the interior of the island ; but numerous smaller streams&nbsp;and rivulets, which take their rise from the shady summit of Mount Artemira, water the surrounding plains and&nbsp;valleys. The inhabitants have a great taste for gardens ;&nbsp;and around the villages are several cultivated fields and&nbsp;orchards, containing fig, pomegranate, and orange trees.&nbsp;The peach-tree, which is said by Pliny to have produced&nbsp;no fruit in his time, is now more fruitful ; but the fruit is&nbsp;deficient in flavour, from the inhabitants not knowing the&nbsp;art of ingrafting trees. The palm-tree is as flourishing&nbsp;as in ancient times. In the uncultivated valleys which&nbsp;abound throughout the island, wild roses hang around the&nbsp;foot of the rocks ; beds of flowing myrrh perfume the&nbsp;air ; laurel roses adorn the banks of the rivulets with their&nbsp;gaudy flowers ; and the fertile soil is besides covered with&nbsp;a profusion of weeds and useless plants. Fine trees formerly crowned the highest mountains, the resin from which&nbsp;supplied abundantly the wants of the navy ; but they have&nbsp;been generally cut down by the Turks. On the sloping&nbsp;hills fig-trees, carob-trees, and others both useful and&nbsp;agreeable, still grow abundantly: the vine also holds its&nbsp;place, and produces a species of wine which was highly&nbsp;valued by the ancients, and is still extolled on account of&nbsp;its delicacy and perfume. The valleys afford rich pastures, and the plains produce every species of grain : the&nbsp;wheat is of an excellent quality, the ear weighty, and filled with the finest grain, as white as snow, and which makes&nbsp;excellent bread ; and, but for the extortions of its barbarian&nbsp;rulers, the island might be the seat of agriculture, as well&nbsp;as commerce, and might export large quantities of corn.&nbsp;But the Turks are lazy and ignorant, and the Greeks are&nbsp;loaded with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corvées ;</span><span class="font0"> and, being further discouraged by the&nbsp;fear of being robbed of the produce of their labours, leave</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">these rich plains unimproved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are two cities in the island, namely, Rhodes, the capital, which is inhabited chiefly by Turks, with a small&nbsp;proportion of Jews ; and the ancient Lindus, which is now&nbsp;reduced to a hamlet, situated on the east side of the island,&nbsp;nearly in the centre. It is entirely peopled by Greeks,&nbsp;who are almost all employed in commerce ; and its har</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bour, which is far from spacious, is much frequented by the small craft of the country, which thence export the produce&nbsp;of the island, and bring back foreign goods in exchange.&nbsp;A few are employed in rural labours. There are five villages occupied by Turks, and by a small number of Jews ;&nbsp;and there are five towns and forty-one villages inhabited by&nbsp;Greeks. According to Savery, the number of families in&nbsp;the island is 7300 ; namely, of Turks 4700, of Greeks 2500,&nbsp;and of Jews 100. Estimating five persons in each family,&nbsp;the population of the island will amount to 36,500. Turner, on the other hand, a later traveller, estimates the inhabitants at only 20,000 ; namely, 14,000 Greeks, who are&nbsp;dispersed in forty-two villages, and 6000 Turks, with a&nbsp;small mixture of Jews, chiefly residing in the capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes has long groaned under the despotic rule of the barbarous Turks, By which the people have been impoverished, and the country depopulated. The pachas, to whom&nbsp;is delegated the supreme rule of the grand signior, generally use their authority for the purpose of extortion, and&nbsp;accumulate riches by robbing the unfortunate inhabitants&nbsp;committed to their charge. According to Savery, the revenue in Rhodes is derived from numerous taxes, namely, a poll-tax, a land-tax, the tithe of the crops, a port duty,&nbsp;a tax on houses, cattle, on salt, on vineyards, on wax, at&nbsp;tolls, and the farming of bagnios. But it is of little moment&nbsp;what taxes are established. There is no restraint on the&nbsp;power of the pacha, who seizes on the people’s substance&nbsp;wherever he sees it, and from whose vigilant rapacity no&nbsp;accumulation of property can be concealed. “ Ask not,”&nbsp;says Savery<sub>1</sub> in his letter to his correspondent, “ what is&nbsp;become of that powerful people, who, taking advantage of&nbsp;their happy situation, of their forests, harbours, and of the&nbsp;fertility of their soil, crossed the Mediterranean with their&nbsp;victorious fleets. Liberty is no more ; and genius and&nbsp;science exist only where they are encouragcd by her smile.&nbsp;The Turkish government has filled up the measure of their&nbsp;misfortunes ; and a few wretches, without commerce, arts,&nbsp;or industry, because they are without property, wander&nbsp;here and there over the desolated plains of the country of&nbsp;their ancestors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The antiquities in Rhodes are not of an earlier date than the residence of the knights of Malta. The remains of their&nbsp;fine old fortress are still to be seen, namely, a venerable&nbsp;moated castle of great size and strength, so fortified as to&nbsp;seem almost impregnable. The cells of the knights are yet&nbsp;entire, forming a street within the works ; and near these is&nbsp;the cathedral or chapel, where doors of sycamore wood, curiously carved, are preserved in their original state. The&nbsp;sanctuary has been converted by the Turks into a magazine&nbsp;for military stores. Dr Clarke observed several inscriptions at Rhodes on marble altars of a cylindrical form,&nbsp;adorned with sculptured wreaths and festoons, supported by&nbsp;rams’ heads. Several vases of great antiquity were also dug&nbsp;up in a garden, of which he obtained one with upright handles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes was one of the most distinguished states of ancient Greece. Its early history is either lost in the darkness of antiquity, or it is disfigured by fabulous traditions. The Rhodians were early celebrated as expert navigators ;&nbsp;but it was not till the time of the Peloponnesian war that&nbsp;they were known as an independent state. The city was&nbsp;afterwards built, and the people were at this time rent into&nbsp;two factions, one of whom favoured the Athenians, the&nbsp;other the Spartans. The latter acquired the ascendency,&nbsp;and an aristocracy was established. The island was afterwards oppressed by Mausolus, king of Caria, and the inhabitants applying to the Athenians, by their assistance regained their liberty. From this period to that of Alexander the Great, the Rhodians enjoyed uninterrupted tran-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
