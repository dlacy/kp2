It stands in a strong position, and has a castle, eight churches, and 5460 inhabitants ; and is remarkable for the victory of the French over the Austrians in 1796. Long. 10. 47. E. Lat. 45. 42. N.</p><p>STOBÆUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes,</hi> whose compilations have been found so highly valuable, is supposed to have been born at Stobi, a city of Macedonia. Heeren has endeavoured to render it probable that he must have lived’ between the years 450 and 500. He does not appear to have been a Christian. From about five hundred writers, in verse as well as prose, he extracted and digested an immense collection of passages; which has most commonly been considered as one work divided into four books, the first two being described as “ Eclogæ Physicæ et Ethicæ,” and the other two as Sermones. But, according to Heeren, they constitute two distinct compilations. As many of the books quoted by Stobæus have scarcely left any other vestiges behind them, his merit in preserving these numerous and variegated reliques of antiquity cannot well be too highly estimated. Of the third and fourth books, otherwise called the Flolegium, the Creek text was published by Victor Trincavellus, Venet. 1536, 4to. An edition, accompanied with a Latin version, was published by Conrad Gesner, Tiguri, 1548, fol. It was reprinted at Basel in 1549, and at Zürich in 1559. Other editions succeeded ; but they have all been nearly superseded by that of Gaisford, Oxon. 1822, 4 tom. 8vo. The text, which has been adjusted with great industry and skill, is not accompanied with a Latin translation. Of the “ Eclogarum libri duo,” the Greek text was first published together with a Latin version by Canter, Antverp. 1575, fol. The editor made use of two manuscripts belonging to Sambucus and Sirlet ; and hence a certain bibliographer has described this as Sirlet’s edition. A valuable edition of the Eclogæi was long afterwards published by Heeren, Gottingæ, 1792-4, 2 tom. 8vo. The Florilegium and the Eclogæ had been published in the same volume, under the title of “ Stobæi Sententiæ, ex thesauris Græcorum delectae.” Lugduni, 1668, fol. Some copies have a new title, with the date of 1609. Here we must not overlook the elegant labours of Grotius : “ Dicta Poetarum quæ apud Stobæum exstant, emendata, et Latino carmine reddita.” Paris. 1623, 4to.</p><p>STOCKBRIDGE, a town of the hundred of King’s Som- bome, in the division of Andover, in the county of Hampshire, 66 miles from London. It stands in a pleasant valley, with various streams running through it, which afford great sport to parties who repair to them to enjoy trout-fishing. It is an ancient borough, and returned two members to parliament till 1832, when it was disfranchised. It has a small market on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 643, in 1811 to 663, in 1821 to 715, and in 1831 to 851.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>paved. They run parallel to each other, and are united by cross streets ; but in all of them the gutters in the middle are very repulsive to more than one sense. The houses however are large, firmly built, and not destitute of taste. The royal palace is of colossal dimensions, and erected in a noble style of architecture. Being rather elevated, it commands a view of the whole city on one side, and is surrounded with tasteful gardens on the other. Within it is contained the presence-chamber, the royal museum, a library of 30,000 volumes, the collection of the Swedish academies, a square with a monument and figure of Gustavus III., and the German church, with a tower of 120 feet in height. In the same part are also the exchange, the bank, the cabinet of coins and medals, the mint, the college of mining, and the town-hall. The royal stables are in another division. On one of the islands, forming a district, are the naval storehouses, and the hall of the admiralty. On another island, also a district, is a fort with twelve cannon and a lazaretto. On many of these districts, though each has some good buildings, the others are poor wooden houses, without taste or ornament, and destitute of cleanliness. The city is under the government of a stadtholder, with inferior officers ; and under the police are organized bodies of watchmen and firemen. Here both the civil and the criminal courts are held. The ecclesiastical affairs are managed by the consistory, with a superintendent as president. Under it are fourteen pastorates of the Lutheran religion ; and there are besides places of worship for German and French Calvinists, for Catholics, and for Finnish Lutherans. There are many schools both for elementary and classical learning, and also an academy of sciences, with an astronomical observatory, a society of antiquaries, and other bodies for promoting the different branches of knowledge. There are abundance of benevolent institutions, adapted to alleviate the various calamities to which mankind are subject, but especially hospitals for seamen and widows. Stockholm is the chief manufacturing place of the kingdom, and supplies silk, woollen, and cotton clothing, much linen, and also refined sugar, tobacco and snuff, pottery and china ware, glass, jewellery, brandy, and many smaller articles, but almost exclusively for domestic use. It is also the chief mart of foreign trade, to which the excellence and security of its harbour greatly contributes. About 500 or 600 vessels, of different burdens, are yearly despatched. Some of these arrive with cargoes of corn, but many in ballast. They are loaded with the excellent iron of Sweden, with copper, tar, pitch, anchors, nails, cannon, bar-steel, planks, masts, cordage, hides, leather, tiles, and in some years a large quantity of preserved herrings. The city has establishments for recreation in two theatres, several public walks, and a variety of clubs and other social assemblies. The population has been fluctuating. In 1795 it amounted to 74,378, in 1800 to 75,511, in 1805 to 72,652, in 1814 to 62,830, in 1818 to 65,474, in 1826 to 77,273, in 1832 to 79,526. Long. 17. 59. 30. E. Lat. 59. 19. 15. N.STOCKING, that part of the clothing of the leg and foot which immediately covers and screens them from the rigour of the cold. Anciently, the only stockings in use were made of cloth, or of milled stuffs sewed together; but since the invention of knitting and weaving stockings of silk, wool, cotton, thread, &amp;c. the use of cloth stockings is quite discontinued. Dr Howell, in his History of the World, vol. ii. p. 222, relates, that Queen Elizabeth, in 1501, was presented with a pair of black knit silk stockings by her silk woman, and thenceforth she never wore cloth ones any more. The same author adds, that King Henry VIII. ordinarily wore cloth hose, except there came from Spain,· by great chance, a pair of silk stockings. His son, King Edward VI., was presented with a pair of long Spanish silk stockings by Sir Thomas Gresham, and the present wasSTOCKHOLM, the capital of the kingdom of Sweden, stands in the centre of the province of that name. It is built on two peninsulas, and several islands of different dimensions, which are connected by numerous bridges and ferries, and, including the water, is of great extent, being two and a quarter miles in length, and near two miles in breadth. A gτeat part of this enclosure is not covered with houses ; and in many parts the rocks are interspersed among patches of land and gardens, so as to give it an appearance very different from that of any other of the European capitals. The whole is divided into ten districts, the most important of which, called the city <hi rend="italic">(Stadt),</hi> is small but interesting, from being the residence of the higher classes of the inhabitants, and the site of the most prominent buildings. In this division the streets are narrow, dark, and badly</p></body></text></TEI>
