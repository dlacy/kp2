It is said to have been called in ancient times by other names,—Sciras, which associates it with the worship of Athena Sciras ; Cychreia, which connects it with the Eleusinian cultus and the sacred serpent (<hi rend="italic">Κυχρείδης ὄφις</hi>) of Demeter; and Pityussa. There was a small stream, Bocarus or Bocalia, in the island. The city, which bore the same name as the island, was originally situated on the south coast opposite AEgina, but was afterwards transferred to a promontory on the east side nearer Athens. The transference corresponds to a total change in the political relations of Salamis. It was originally connected, not with Attica, but with AEgina and with Megara, the competitors of Athens in the struggle for supremacy in the Saronic Gulf. The most prominent heroes of the island, Telamon, Ajax, and Teucer, were AEacidæ from Ægina. But about the end of the 7th century b.c. the war between Athens and Megara for the possession of Salamis was, under the guidance of Solon, determined in favour of Athens. A line of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (ii. 558) is said to have been interpolated by the Athenians in support of their claim to the island, while the Megarian version of the passage was quite different. The priestess of Athena Polias might not eat Attic cheese, but it was lawful for her to eat foreign or Salaminian cheese. Salamis, having come so late into the hands of the Athenians, retained, like Eleusis, more local independence than the other denies. The island remained subject to Athens in later history, except during the period 318 to 232 b.c., when it was abandoned to the Macedonian rule. The name of Salamis is famous chiefly on account of the great sea-fight, 480 b.c., in which the allied Greeks defeated the Persians under Xerxes. The battle took place beside the town of Salamis and the island of Psyttaleia, at the south-eastern end of the straits.</p><p>A city on the east coast of Cyprus, near the river Pediaeus, said to have been founded by the Salaminian Teucer, son of Telamon, was also called Salamis.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
