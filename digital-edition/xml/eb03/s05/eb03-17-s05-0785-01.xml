The Egyptians, who were diſtinguiſhed for learning at an early period, at firſt expreſſed their words by a delineation of figures called <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphics,</hi> A more conciſe mode of writing ſeems to have been afterwards introduced, in which only a part of the ſymbol or picture was drawn. This anſwered the purpoſe of ſhort-hand in ſome degree. After them the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Romans<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Vide Buxtorf, Diog-Laertius, Plutarch, &amp;c.</p></note> *, adopted different methods of abbreviating their words and ſentences, ſuited to their reſpective languages. The iatials, the finals, or radicals, often ſerved for whole words ; and various combinations of theſe ſometimes formed a ſentence. Arbitrary marks were likewiſe employed to determine the meaning, and to affiſt legibility ; and it ſeems probable that every writer, and every author of antiquity, had ſome peculiar method of abbreviation, calculated to facilitate the expreſſion of his own ſentiments, and intelligible only to himſelf.</p><p>It is alſo probable, that ſome might by theſe means take down the heads of a diſcourſe or oration; but few, very few, it is preſumed, could have followed a speaker through all the meanders of rhetoric, and noted with preciſion every ſyllable, as it dropt from his mouth, in a manner legible even to themſelves.</p><p>To arrive at ſuch conſummate perfection in the art was reſerved for more modern times, and is ſtill an acquiſition by no means general.<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> The value of ſtenography is not unknown to the learned; and the care and ſucceſs with which it has been lately cultivated in theſe kingdoms will, in all probability, ſoon render it an object of general attention. No one, however, appears to us to have ſimplified and improved the art ſo much as Dr Mavor, author of <hi rend="italic">Univerſal Stenography,</hi> who has liberally permitted us to preſent our readers with a complete view of his ſcheme. To thoſe who wiſh to become proficients in <hi rend="smallcaps">Short-writing,</hi> we earneſtly recommend his entire publication (printed for Cadell and Davis, Strand, London), which in many ſchools of the firſt reputation now forms a deſerved claſs book.</p></note></p><p>In every language of Europe, till about the cloſe of the 16th century, the Roman plan of abbreviating (viz. ſubſtituting the initials or radicals, with the help of arbitraries, for words) appears to have been employed. Till then no regular alphabet had been invented expreſsly for ſtenography, when an Engliſh gentleman of the name of <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> invented and publiſhed one<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> Mr Locke ſays, a regular method of ſhort-writing ſeems to be known and practiſed only in Britain. This is not now the caſe ; and indeed there is no reaſon to doubt whether characters may not be invented to expreſs the various founds, or letters, employed in any language, either ancient or modern.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(b).</hi> His plan was ſoon altered and improved, or at leaſt pretended to be ſo. One alteration ſucceeded another ; and at intervals, for a series of years paſt, ſome men of ingenuity and application have compoſed and publiſhed ſyſtems of ſtenography, and doubtleſs have themſelves reaped all the advantages that attend it. But among the various methods that have been propoſed, and the different plans that have been adopted by individuals, none has yet appeared fortunate enough to gain general approbation ; or proved ſufficiently simple, clear, and conciſe, to be univerſally ſtudied and practiſed.</p><p>Some ſyſtems are replete with unmeaning ſymbols, perplexing arbitraries, and ill-judged contractions ; which render them ſo difficult to be attained by a common capacity, or ordinary application, that it is not to be wondered at if they have ſunk into neglect, and are now no longer known<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(c) A list of writers on ſtenography.

Other ſyſtems, by being too prolix, by containing a multiplicity of characters, and thoſe characters not ſimple or eaſily remembered, become ineffectual to the purpoſe of expedition, and are only ſuperior in obſcurity to a common hand. Some, again, not only reject all arbitrages and contractions, but even prepositions and terminations ; which laſt, if not too laviſhly employed and badly deviſed, highly contribute to promote both expedition and legibility ; and though they reduce their characters to fewer than can poſſibly expreſs the various modifications of sound, yet they make nearly one half of them complex. In the diſposition of the vowels, there is the greateſt perplexity in moſt ſyſtems. A dot is ſometimes ſubſtituted for all the vowels indiſcriminately, and the judgment is left to determine which letter out of six any dot is intended to expreſs; or a minute ſpace is allotted them; ſo that unleſs they be arranged with mathematical preciſion they cannot be diſtinguiſhed from one another ; but ſuch a minute attention is inconſiſtent with the nature of ſhort-hand, which ſhould teach us to write down in a ſhort time, as well as in ſrnall bounds, what we wiſh to preſerve of what we hear. Nor is the plan of lifting the pen and putting the next conſonant in the vowel’s place, in the middle of words, leſs liable to objections ; or that of repreſenting all the vowels by diſtinct characters, being obviously ill calculated for facility and diſpatch, and conſequently inadmissible into any uſeful ſyſtem.</p><p>It is to be confessed, that the perſon who firſt pro-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0792.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0786"/>

But, in fine, moſt ſyſtems, either in their plan or execution, labour under ſome capital defect, attended with circumſtances highly discouraging to the learner, and which in a great meaſure defeat the end of their invention, by being too complicated to be learned with eaſe and remembered with accuracy, or to be practiſed with the expedition which is requiſite ; and ſo difficult to be deciphered, that a man can ſcarcely read what he has juſt written.</p><p>To obviate theſe defects; to provide againſt prolixity and conciſeneſs, which might occaſion obſcurity ; to exhibit a ſyſtem founded on the ſimpleſt principles, which might be eaſily learned and read, and yet be capable of the utmoſt expedition—were the motives that gave riſe to the preſent attempt.</p><p>This method will be found different from any yet publiſhed, and ſuperior to all in the diſpoſition of the vowels and the facility of arranging them ; the confusion in placing which ſeems to detract from the merit of the best performances on the ſubject ; and it may be affirmed, without oſtentation, that characters ſimpler in their form, and more perfect in their union, have not been applied to the art of ſtenography.</p><p>As well as it could be determined, the ſimpleſt characters are appropriated to the letters moſt uſually employed : indeed, as far as poſſible, thoſe which are complex have been rejected ; but as it was an object always kept in view that the writing ſhould be on a line, a few are admitted into the alphabet for that reason.</p><p>The characters for the double and triple conſonants are the eaſieſt that could be invented, conſiſtent with perspicuity<note anchored="true" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Preface Johnson's Dictionary.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(e) ;</hi> for care has been taken to provide againſt all obſcurity which might ariſe by adopting letters too similar in their formation ; and with reſpect to the prepoſitions and terminations, thoſe which occur moſt frequently are expressed by the ſimpleſt characters, which will be found perfectly eaſy in their application.</p><p>The arbitraries are few in number<note anchored="true" n="7" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(d)</hi> Mr Byrom rejected vowels entirely in the middle of words, as others before him had only done partially. Without critically examining the executive part of his performance, which is very defective, it muſt be owned, that it is above the reach of human ingenuity to exceed his general plan ; which for ever muſt be the baſis of every future rational ſyſtem.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(f),</hi> and the arbitrary abbreviations, as they are entirely from the letters of the alphabet, and choſen from ſome thouſands of words in common uſe, will well repay the learner for an hour’s trouble in committing them to memory.</p><p>The laſt chapter lays down a ſcheme of abbreviation, compriſed in a few rules, perfectly eaſy to be underſtood and practiſed by proficients in this art, which we hope will anſwer the expectation of the author, and will be found free from the perplexity complained oſ in many ſyſtems where abbreviation is admitted. Theprincipal rules are new, are ſo eaſy, ſo extenſive in their uſe, and ſo conſiſtent with expedition and legibility, if applied with judgment, that they alone might ſuffice. The learner is however adviſed by no means to adopt any of them, till experience has convinced him that they may be uſed without error or injury to legibility. All abbreviating rules are ſuited to thoſe only who have made ſome progreſs in the ſtenographic art ; for although they certainly promote expedition in a wonderful manner, and afford the greateſt eaſe to a proficient, yet a learner, as expedition is not his first, though his ultimate view, ſhould admit of nothing that in the leaſt renders the reading difficult.</p><p>CHAP. II.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Engliſh alphabet conſiſts of twenty-six letters ; six of which are vowels, <hi rend="italic">a, e, i, o, u,</hi> and y; and the other twenty conſonants, b <hi rend="italic">, c, d ,f, g, h,j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x,</hi> and z.</p><p>This alphabet, as is obſerved by the beſt grammarians that have written on the language, is both defective and redundant in expreſſing the various modifications of sound<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(e)</hi> Thoſe for <hi rend="italic">th</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> may be either made upright or sloping to the right.</p></note> *.</p><p>Cuſtom or prejudice has aſſigned ſome letters a place, when others would with much more propriety expreſs the ſame sound: and to this may be added, that ſeveral letters, ſometimes in one word, ſeem to be admitted for no other reason than to perplex a young beginner or a foreigner, as an obſtruction to true pronunciation, and to add to the apparent length oſ the word, when they are entirely quieſcent and uſeleſs. That this is the genius of the orthography of our language muſt be perceived by the moſt ſuperficial obſerver ; but no modern tongue is absolutely free from the ſame exceptions. In particular, the French has a great number of dormant letters, which, it is obvious, render the pronunciation more difficult and perplexing to learners<note anchored="true" n="9" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(f)</hi> Theſe are not by any means prescribed ; they may be employed or not according to the fancy of the learner.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(g).</hi></p><p>But as it is neither our buſineſs nor our intention to propoſe a mode of ſpelling different from that in common uſe, when applied to printing or long-hand writing (ſince ſeveral innovators in orthography have fallen into contempt, and their plans have been only preſerved as beacons to warn others of the folly of endeavouring to ſubvert eſtabliſhed principles<note anchored="true" n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(g)</hi> The Latin and Greek claim a juſt ſuperiority over every modern tongue in this reſpect.

Vowels, being only ſimple articulate sounds, though they are the connectives of conſonants, and employed in every word and every ſyllable, are not neceſsary to be inſerted in the middle of words ; becauſe the conſonants, if fully pronounced, with the assiſtance of connection, will always diſcover the meaning of a word, and make the writing perfectly legible.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> II If a vowel is not ſtrongly accented in the incipient ſyllable of a word, or if it is mute in the final, it is likewiſe to be omitted ; becauſe the found of the incipient vowel is often implied in that of the firſt consonant, which will consequently supply its place.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> III. But if the vowel conſtitutes the firſt or laſt ſyllable of a word, or is ſtrongly accented at its beginning or end, that vowel is continually to be written.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> IV. If a word begins or ends with two or more vowels though ſeparated, or when there is a coalition of vowels, as in dipthongs and tripthongs ; only one of them is to be expreſſed, which muſt be that which agrees beſt with the pronunciation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> V. In monoſyllables, if they begin or end</p><p>with a vowel, it is always to be inſerted, unleſs the vowel be <hi rend="italic">e</hi> mute at the end of a word.</p><p>Such are the general principles of this art ; in vindication and ſupport oſ which it will be needleſſs to offer any arguments, when it is conſidered that brevity and expedition are the chief objects, if conſiſtent with legibility; and the ſubſequent ſpecimens in the orthography recommended will, we hope, be ſufficient to ſhow that there is no real deficiency in the laſt mentioned particular.</p><p>He who md us mſt be etrnl, grt, nd mnptnt.

III.</p><p>As the whole of this art depends upon a regular method and a simple alphabet, we have not only endeavoured to eſtabliſh the former on ſatisfactory principles, but have been careful to appropriate, according to the comparative frequency oſ their occurrence, ſuch characters for the letters as, after repeated trials and alterations, were conceived to be the beſt adapted for diſpatch.</p><p>The ſtenographic alphabet consists of 18 diſtinct characters (viz. two for the vowels and the rest for the conſonants ), taken from lines and ſemicircular curves ; the formation and application of which we ſhall now explain, beginning with the vowels.</p><p>For the three firſt vowels, <hi rend="italic">a, e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> a comma is ap-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0794.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0788"/>
propriated in different poſitions ; and for the other three, <hi rend="italic">o, u,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> a point. The comma and point, when applied to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> is to be placed, as in Plate CCCCLXXXII. at the top of the next character ; when for <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> oppoſite to the middle ; and when for i and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at the bottom.</p><p>This arrangement of the vowels is the moſt ſimple and diſtinct that can eaſily be imagined. Places at the top, the middle, and the bottom of characters, which make three different poſitions, are as eaſily diſtinguiſhed from one another as any three ſeparate characters could be ; and a comma is made with the ſame facility as a point.</p><p>Simple lines may be drawn four different ways ; perpendicular, horizontal, and with an angle of about 45 degrees to the right and left. An aſcending oblique line to the right, which will be perfectly diſtinct from the rest when joined to any other character, may likewiſe be admitted. Theſe characters being the ſimplest in nature, are aſſigned to those five consonants which moſt frequently occur, viz. l <hi rend="italic">, r, t, c</hi> hard or <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> ſoft or s <hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi></p><p>Every’ circle may be divided with a perpendicular and horizontal line, ſo as to form likewiſe four diſtinct characters.

tremely uſeful and convenient to thoſe who have attained a proper knowledge of the ſubject, and lead to a greater degree of expedition, at the ſame time that they diminiſh the labour of writing. It has been obſerved in the introduction, that abbreviations are only to be employed by proficients in this art ; becauſe expedition is not the firſt, though the ultimate, object in view : and that an eaſy legibility is of the utmoſt conſequence to the learner ; which, however, cannot be preſerved, if he adopts too ſoon thoſe very rules which in time will afford him the greateſt eaſe when applied with judgement.</p><p>The following ſhort and practical rules will be found, we hope, fully adequatc to every purpoſe for which they were intended, and are far ſuperior in the facility of their application to any which we have ſeen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> I.

Subſtantives, adjectives, verbs, and participles, when the senſe will direct to the meaning, are to be expressed by their initial conſonant with the distinguiſhing marks exhibited in Plate CCCCLXXXΠ. viz. a ſubſtantive muſt have the dot exactly over its initial conſonant ; an adjective muſt have a dot under it ; a verb is to be expreſſed by a comma over its initial conſonant; and a participle by a comma under<note anchored="false" n="16" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Plate CCCCLXXXIII.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(m).</hi> Theſe being the four principal parts of ſpeech will be sufficient ; and an adept will never be at a loss to know when he can with ſafety apply this rule to them.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> III. To render the writing more legible, the laſt letter oſ the word may be joined to the firſt, and the proper mark applied.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> IV. The conſtituent or radical part of words, eſpecially if they are long, will often ſerve for the whole, or ſometimes the firſt syllable ; as, we ought to moderate our <hi rend="italic">ex.</hi> by our <hi rend="italic">circum. ;</hi> a man’s <hi rend="italic">man.</hi> commonly ſhape his <hi rend="italic">for. ∙</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> V.

But if by any means you have been persuaded to think, that this poverty makes me leſs considered in my country, or in any degree unhappy, you are extremely deceived. I have no reaſon to complain of fortune, ſhe ſupplies me with all that nature requires ; and if I am without ſuperfluities, I am alſo free from the desire of them. With theſe I conseſs I ſhould be more able to ſuccour the neceſſitous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied ; but as ſmall as my poſſeſſions are, I can ſtill contribute ſomething to the ſupport of the ſtate and the aſſiſtance of my friends. With regard to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the richeſt : for Rome knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue and ability. She appoints me to officiate in the moſt auguſt ceremonies of religion ; ſhe entruſts me with the command of her armies ; ſhe confides to my care the moſt important negotiations. My poverty does not leſſen the weight and influence of my counsels in the ſenate ; the Roman people honour me for that very poverty which you consider as a diſgrace ; they know the many opportunities I have had in war to enrich myſelf without incurring cenſure ; they are convinced of my disintereſted zeal for their proſperity ; and if I have any thing to complain of in the return they make, it is only the exceſs of their applauſe. What value then can I ſet upon your gold and silver ! What king can add any thing to my fortune ! Always attentive to diſcharge the duties incumbent on me, I have a mind free from ſelf-reproach, and I have an honeſt fame. <hi rend="italic">Dodsley's Preceptor.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Letter to a Friend against waste of Time.</hi></p><p>Converſe often with yourſelf, and neither laviſh your time, nor ſuffer others to rob you of it.

doing nothing, or in doing what we ſhould not do. We don’t ſeem to know the value of time, nor how precious a day is ; nor do we conſider that every moment brings us nearer our end. Reflect upon this, I entreat you, and keep a ſtrict account of time. Procraſtination is the moſt dangerous thing in life. Nothing is properly ours but the inſtant we breathe in, and all the rest is nothing ; it is the only good we posseſs ; but then it is fleeting, and the firſt comer robs us of it. Men are ſo weak, that they think they oblige by giving of trifles, and yet reckon that time as nothing for which the moſt grateful perſon in the world can never make amends. Let us therefore conſider time as the moſt valuable of all things ; and every moment ſpent, without ſome improvement in virtue or ſome advancement in goodneſs, as the greateſt ſublunary loss.</p><p><hi rend="italic">St Paul’s Speech before Agrippa and Festus.</hi></p><p>I think myſelf happy, king Agrippa, that I ſhall anſwer for myſelf this day before thee, touching all things whereof I am accuſed of the Jews : eſpecially becauſe I know thee to be expert in all cuſtoms and queſtions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beſeech thee to hear me patiently. My manner of life from my youth, which was at firſt among mine own nation at Jeruſalem, know all the Jews, which knew me from the beginning (if they would teſtify), that, after the ſtraiteſt ſect of our religion I lived a Phariſee. And now I ſtand and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made by God unto our fathers : unto which promiſe our twelve tribes inſtantly ſerving God day and night hope to come ; for which hope’s ſake, king Agrippa, I am accuſed of the Jews. Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead, when God himſelf has given assurance of it unto all men, in that he hath raised Chriſt from the dead ? As for my own part, moſt noble Feſtus, I own I once verily thought that even I myself ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth. Which thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem. I puniſhed the ſaints oft in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme; and being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange cities. In purſuit of which, as I went to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief prieſts: At midday, O king, I ſaw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining about me, and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice ſpeaking unto me, and laying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me ? It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And I ſaid, Who art thou, Lord ? And he ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. But riſe, and ſtand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a witneſs both of theſe things which thou hast ſeen, and of thoſe things in which I will appear unto thee. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion : but ſhewed firſt unto them of Damaſcus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God. For theſe cauſes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great; saying none other things than thoſe which the prophets and Moses did ſay ſhould come : That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhow light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. This is the real truth : Believe me, I am no peſtilent fellow, nor mover of ſedition ; but always endeavour all that lies in me to preſerve a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man : nor can the Jews prove the things whereof they now accuſe me. Neither am I, Feſtus, beſides myſelf ; but ſpeak thus freely before the king, becauſe he knows theſe things to be fact ; yea, I am fully perſuaded the king knows them all to be fact ; for they were not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believeſt thou the prophets? I know that thou believeſt. And would to God that not only thou but alſo all that hear me this day, were altogether ſuch as I am except theſe bonds. <hi rend="italic">Holmes’s Rhetoric.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Ροpe to Atterbury.</hi></p><p>Once more I write to you as I promiſed, and this once I ſear will be the laſt ; the curtain will ſoon be drawn between my friend and me, and nothing left but to wiſh you a long good night ; may you enjoy a ſtate of repoſe in this life not unlike that sleep of the ſoul which ſome have believed is to ſucceed it, where we lie utterly forgetful of that world from which we are gone, and ripening for that to which we are to go. If you retain any memory of the paſt, let it only image to you what has pleaſed you beſt ; ſometimes preſent a dream of an abſent friend, or bring you back an agreeable converſation. But, upon the whole, I hope you will think leſs of the time paſt than the future ; as the former has been leſs kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do not envy the world your ſtudies : They will tend to the benefit of men, againſt whom you can have no complaint ; I mean, of all poſterity : and, perhaps, at your time of life, nothing elſe is worth your care. What is every year of a wife man’s life but a cenſure or critic on the paſt ? Thoſe w hoſe date is the ſhorteſt, live long enough to laugh at one half of it; The boy deſpiſes the infant, the man the boy, the philoſopher both, and the Chriſtian all. You may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility ; and you will never ſuffer your age to be but a ſecond infancy. The toys and baubles of your childhood are hardly now more below you than thoſe toys of our riper and our declining years ; the drums and rattles of ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of avarice. At this time, when you are cut off from a little ſociety, and made a citizen of the world at large, you ſhould bend your talents not to ſerve a party, or a few, but all mankind. Your genius ſhould mount above that miſt, in which its participation and neighbourhood with earth hath long involved it : To ſhine abroad, and to heaven, ought to be the busineſs and the glory of your preſent ſituation. Remember it was at ſuch a time that the greateſt lights of antiquity dazzled and blazed the moſt; in their retreat, in their exile, or in their death. But why do I talk of dazzling or blazing? it was then that they did good, that they gave light, and that they became guides to mankind. Thoſe aims alone are worthy of ſpirits truly great, and ſuch I therefore hope will be yours.

Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a ſpirit entered into another life, as one just upon, the edge of immortality, where the paſſions and affections muſt be much more exalted, and where you ought to deſpiſe all little views and all mean retroſpects. Nothing is worth your looking back ; and therefore look forward, and make (as you can) the world look after you ; but take care it be not with pity, but with eſteem and admiration.
