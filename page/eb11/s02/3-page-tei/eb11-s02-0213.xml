In 1904-1905, 14,188 workmen were employed in the mines of the province of Cagliari. The following table (from the consular report of 1905) shows the amount and value of the minerals extracted, the whole amount being exported:</p><table><row><cell>Zinc—</cell><cell>Tons.</cell><cell>Value £.</cell></row><row><cell>Calamine .</cell><cell>99,749</cell><cell>466,070</cell></row><row><cell>Blende</cell><cell>26,051</cell><cell>I35,569</cell></row><row><cell>Lead	</cell><cell>24,798</cell><cell>140,534</cell></row><row><cell>Silver	</cell><cell>167</cell><cell>5,012</cell></row><row><cell>Manganese .</cell><cell>2,362</cell><cell>3,360</cell></row><row><cell>Antimony</cell><cell>1,005</cell><cell>4,700</cell></row><row><cell>Lignite ....</cell><cell>15,429</cell><cell>8,778</cell></row><row><cell>Anthracite</cell><cell>577</cell><cell>586</cell></row><row><cell>Copper ....</cell><cell>98</cell><cell>445</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>170,236</cell><cell>765.054</cell></row></table><p>The chief mines are those of Gennamare and Ingurtosu and others of the group owned by the Pertusola Company, Monteponi and Montevecchio. The mining and washing plant is extremely good and largely constructed at Cagliari. The most important minerals are lead and zinc, obtained in lodes in the forms of galena and calamine respectively. In most cases, owing to the mountainous character of the country, horizontal galleries are possible. The Monteponi Company smelts its own zinc, but the lead is almost all smelted at the furnaces of Pertusola near Spezia. Silver has also been found in the district of Sarrabus, iron at S. Leone to the west of Cagliari, and antimony and other metals near Lanusei, but in smaller quantities than in the Iglesias district, so that comparatively little mining has as yet been done there. Lignite is also mined at Bacu Abis, near Gonnesa, and Anthracite in small quantities near Seui.</p><p>The salt-pans at Cagliari and of Carloforte are of considerable importance; they are let by the government to contractors, who have the sole right of manufacture, but are bound to sell the salt necessary for Sardinian consumption at 35 centesimi (3½d.) per cwt.; the government does not exercise the salt monopoly in Sardinia any more than in Sicily, but in the latter island the right of manufacture is unrestricted. The total production in 1905 was 149,431 tons; the average price of salt for the island in 1905 was 2½d. per cwt. (unground), and is. per cwt. ground; whereas for Italy, where the government monopoly exists, the price is £1, 12s. the cwt.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi>The total exports of the province of Cagliari in 1905 attained a value of £1,388,735, of which £550,023 was foreign trade, while the imports amounted to £1,085,514, of which £360,758 was foreign trade. Among the exports may be noticed minerals, wines and spirits, tobacco, hides, live animals; and among the imports, groceries, cotton and cereals. The tonnage of the shipping entering and clearing the ports of the province in 1905 was 1,756,866, of which 352,992 was foreign.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Communications.—</hi>The railway system of Sardinia is in the hands of two companies—the Compagnia Reale delle Ferrovie Sarde, and the Compagnia delle Ferrovie Secondarie della Sardegna. The former company’s lines (of the ordinary gauge) run from Cagliari, past Macomer, to Chilivani (with a branch at Decimomannu for Iglesias and Monteponi). From Chilivani the line to Sassari and Porto Torres diverges to the N.W., and that to Golfo degli Aranci to the N.E. The latter company owns narrow-gauge lines from Cagliari to Mandas (whence lines diverge N. to Sorgono and E. to Tortoli, the latter having a short branch from Gairo to Ierzu), from Macomer E. to Nuoro and W. to Bosa, from Sassari S.W. to Alghero, from Chilivani S. to Tirso (on the line between Macomer and Nuoro), and from Monti (on the line from Chilivani to Golfo degli Aranci) N.W. to Tempio. In the south-western portion of the island are several private railways belonging to various mining companies, of which the lines from Monteponi to Portoscuso, and from S. Gavino to Montevecchio, are sometimes available for ordinary passengers. There is also a steam tramway from Cagliari to Quartu S. Elena. The trains are few and the speed on all these lines is moderate, but the gradients are often very heavy.</p><p>Communication is thus most wanted with the northern and south-eastern extremities of the island, and between Tortoli and Nuoro, and Nuoro and Golfo degli Aranci. The main road system, which dates from 1828, previous to which there were only tracks, is good, and the roads well engineered; many of them are traversed daily by post vehicles. Some road motor services have been instituted. The total length of the railways is 602 m., and of the roads of all classes 3101 m., <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 596 yds. per sq. m.</p><p>There is daily steam communication (often interrupted in bad weather) with Civitavecchia from Golfo degli Aranci (the mail route), and weekly steamers run from Cagliari to Naples, Genoa (via the east coast of the island), Palermo and Tunis, and from Porto Torres to Genoa (calling at Bastia in Corsica and Leghorn) and Leghorn direct. A fortnightly line also runs along the west coast of the island from Cagliari to Porto Torres. All these lines (and also the minor lines from Golfo degli Aranci to La Maddalena and from Carloforte to Porto Vesme and Calasetta) are in the hands of the Navigazione Generale Italiana, there being no Sardinian steamship companies. There is also a weekly French service between Porto Torres and Ajaccio in Corsica.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi>Sardinia is divided into two provinces— Cagliari and Sassari; the chief towns of the former (with their communal population in 1901) are: Cagliari (53,057); Iglesias (20,874); Quartu S. Elena (8510), really a large village; Oristano (7107); Fluminimaggiore (9647); Lanusei (3250); and the total population of the province is 486,767: while the chief towns of the latter are Sassari (38,053); Alghero (10,741); Ozieri (9555); Nuoro (7051); Tempio Pausania (14,573); Terranova Pausania (4348); Porto Torres (4225); and the total population of the province 309,026. The density of population is 85∙38 per sq. m. (294∙55 for the whole of Italy), by far the lowest figure of any part of Italy.</p><p>The archiepiscopal sees of the island are: Cagliari (under which are the suffragan sees of Galtelli-Nuoro, Iglesias and Ogliastra), Oristano (with the suffragan see of Ales and Terralba) and Sassari (under which are the suffragan sees of Alghero, Ampurias and Tempio, Bisarchio and Bosa). The number of monastic institutions in the island is very small.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi>The number of scholars in the elementary schools for 1901-1902 was 59·09 per 1000 (Calabria 42∙27, Tuscany 67∙09, Piedmont 118·00); the teachers are 1∙34 per 1000, a total of 1084 of both sexes (among whom only one priest) (Calabria 1∙18, Tuscany 1∙29, Piedmont 2∙0), while the rural schools are not buildings adapted for their purpose. In some of the towns, however, and especially at Iglesias, they are good modern buildings. Still, the percentage of those unable to read and write is 72∙8, while for the whole of Italy it is 56∙0. The male scholars at the secondary schools amounted in 190o to 2∙74 per 1000 inhabitants. The university of Cagliari, which in 1874-1875 had only 60 students, had 260 in 1902-1903. At Sassari in the same year there were 162. There are besides in the island 10 gymnasia, 3 lycées, 6 technical and nautical schools and institutes (including a school of mines at Iglesias), and 9 other institutes for various branches of special education. A tendency is growing up towards the extension of technical and commercial education in place of the exclusively classical instruction hitherto imparted. To the growth of this tendency the excellent results of the agricultural schools have especially contributed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Crime.—</hi>For the years 1897-1901 statistics show that Sardinia has more thefts and frauds than any other region of Italy (1068·15 for Sardinia and 210·56 per 100,000 inhabitants per annum for the rest of Italy). This is no doubt accounted for by the extreme poverty which prevails among the lower classes, though beggars, on the other hand, are very few, the convictions being 8∙95 per 100,000 against 258·15 per 100,000 for the province of Rome. Sardinia has less convictions for serious crimes than any other <hi rend="italic">compartimenta</hi> of south Italy. Public security is considerably improved, and regular brigandage (as distinct from casual robbery) hardly exists. The vendetta, too, is now hardly ever heard of.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi>In 1887 a severe banking crisis occurred in Sardinia. Though harmful to the economic condition of the island, it left agriculture comparatively unaffected, because the insolvent institutions had never fulfilled the objects of their foundation. Agricultural credit operations in Sardinia are carried on by the Bank of Italy, which, however, displays such caution that its action is almost imperceptible. An agricultural loan and credit company has been formed on the ruins of the former institutions, but hitherto no charter has been granted it. Institutions possessing a special character are the <hi rend="italic">monti frumentarii,</hi> public grain deposits, founded for the purpose of supplying peasant proprietors with seed corn, debts being paid in kind with interest after harvest. But they, too, lack funds sufficient to assure extensive and efficient working, even after the law of 1906. Meantime much evil arises from usury in the poorer districts. It is estimated that Sardinia pays, in local and</p></body></text></TEI>
