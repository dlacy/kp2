<p><span class="font0">underſtanding. Being a great admirer of Shakeſpeare, he gave the public an edition of his plays ; to which&nbsp;he prefixed an account of that great man’s life. But&nbsp;the moſt conſiderable of Mr Rowe’s performances was&nbsp;a tranſlation of Lucan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">PharſaHa,</span><span class="font0"> which he juſt lived&nbsp;to finiſh, but not to publiſh ; for it did not appear in&nbsp;print till r728, ten years after his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile, the love of poetry and books did not make him unfit for buſineſs ; for nobody applied cloſer&nbsp;to it when occaſion required. The Duke of Queen ſ-berry, when ſecretary of ſtate, made him ſecretary for&nbsp;public affairs. After the Duke’s death, all avenues&nbsp;were ſtopped to his preferment ; and during the reſt of&nbsp;Queen Anne’s reign he paffed his time with the Muſes&nbsp;and his books. A ſtory, indeed, is told of him, which&nbsp;ſhows that he had ſome acquaintance with her miniſters.&nbsp;It is ſaid, that he went one day to pay his court to the&nbsp;lord treaſurer Oxford, whβ aſked him, “If he under-ftood Spaniſh well ?” He anſwered, “ No but thinking that his Lordſhip might intend to ſend him into&nbsp;Spain on ſome honourable commiſſion, he preſently&nbsp;added, “ that he did not doubt but he could ſhortly be&nbsp;able both to underſtand and to ſpeak it.” The earl approving what he ſaid, Rowe took his leave ; and, retiring a few weeks to learn the language, waited again&nbsp;on the Earl to acquaint him with it. His Lordſhip&nbsp;aſking him, “ If he was ſure he underſtood it thoroughly ?” and Rowe affirming that he did, “ How happy are&nbsp;you, Mr Rowe,” ſaid the Earl, “ that you can have the&nbsp;pleaſure of reading and underſtanding the Hiſtory of Don&nbsp;Quixote in the original!” On the acceſſion of George I.&nbsp;he was made poet laureat, and one of the land ſurveyors&nbsp;of the cuſtoms in the port of London. The prince of&nbsp;Wales conferred on him the clerkſhip of his council ;&nbsp;and the Lord Chancellor Parker made him his ſecretary&nbsp;for the preſentations. He did not enjoy theſe promotions long ; for he died Dec. 6. 1718, in his 45th year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Rowe was twice married, had a ſon by his firſt wife, and a daughter by his ſecond. He was a handſome, genteel man ; and his mind was as amiable as his&nbsp;perſon. He lived beloved ; and at his death had the&nbsp;honour to be lamented by Mr Pope, in an epitaph&nbsp;which is printed in Pope’s works, although it was not&nbsp;affixed on Mr Rowe’s monument in Weſtminſter'ab-bey, where he was interred in the poet’s corner, oppoſite to Chaucer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rowe (Eliſabeth), an Engliſh lady, eminent for her excellent writings both in proſe and verſe, born at&nbsp;Ilcheſter in Somerſetſhire in 1647, was the daughter&nbsp;of worthy parents, Mr Walter Singer and Mrs Eliſabeth&nbsp;Portnel. She received the firſt ſerious impreſſions of&nbsp;religion as ſoon as ſhe was capable of it. There being&nbsp;a great affinity between painting and poetry, this lady,&nbsp;who had a vein for the one, naturally had a taſte for&nbsp;the other. She was alſo very fond of muſic ; chiefly&nbsp;of the grave and ſolemn kind, as beſt ſuited to the&nbsp;grandeur of her ſentiments and the ſublimity of her&nbsp;devotion. But poetry was her favourite employment,&nbsp;her diſtinguiſhing excellence. So prevalent was her genius this way, that her proſe is all poetical. In 1696,&nbsp;a collection of her poems was publiſhed at the deſire of&nbsp;two friends. Pier paraphraſe on the xxxviiith chapter&nbsp;of Job was written at the requeſt of biſhop Ken. She&nbsp;had no other tutor for the French and Italian languages&nbsp;than the honourable Mr Thynne, who willingly </span><span class="font1">took&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the taſk upon himſelf. Her ſhining merit, with the&nbsp;charms oſ her perſon and converſation, had procured&nbsp;her a great many admirers. Among others, it is ſaid,&nbsp;the famous Mr Prior made his addreſſes to her. But Mr&nbsp;Thomas Rowe was to be the happy man. This gentleman was honourably deſcended : and his ſuperior genius, and ſhſatiable thirſt after knowledge, were con-ſpicuous in his earlieſt years. He had formed a defm∙n&nbsp;to compile the lives of all the illuſtrious perſons in antiquity omitted by Plutarch ; which, indeed, he partly&nbsp;executed. Eight lives were publiſhed ſince his deceaſe.&nbsp;They were tranſlated into French by the abbs Bellen-geτ in j 734. He ſpoke with eaſe and fluency ; had a&nbsp;frank and benevolent temper, an inexhauſtible fund of&nbsp;wit, and a communicative diſpoſition. Such was the&nbsp;man who, charmed with the perſon, character, and&nbsp;writings, of our authoreſs, married her in 17 1 o, and&nbsp;made it his ſttidy to repay the felicity with which </span><span class="font1">ſhe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">crowned his life. Too intenſe an application to ſtudy,&nbsp;beyond what the delicacy of his frame would bear, broke&nbsp;his health, and threw him into a conſumption, which&nbsp;put a period to his valuable life in May 1 715, when he&nbsp;was but juſt paſt the 28th year of his age. Mrs Rowe&nbsp;wrote a beautiful elegy on his death ; and continued to&nbsp;the laſt moments of her life to expreſs the higheſt veneration and affection ſor his memory. As ſoon after his&nbsp;deceaſe as her affairs would permit, ſhe indulged her inclination for ſolitude, by retiring to Frome, in Somerſetſhire, in the neighbourhood of which place the&nbsp;greateſt part of her eſtate lay. In this receſs ſt was&nbsp;tlιat ſhe compoſed the moſt celebrated of her works,&nbsp;Friendſhip in Death, and the Letters Moral and Entertaining. In 1736, ſhe publiſhed, the Hiſtory of&nbsp;Joſepli ; a poem which ſhe had written in her younger&nbsp;years. She did not long ſurvive this publication ; for&nbsp;ſhe died of an apoplexy, as was ſuppoſed, Feb. 20.&nbsp;1736-7. In her cabinet were found letters to ſeveral of&nbsp;her friends, which ſhe had ordered to be delivered immediately after her deceaſe. The Rev. Dr Iſaac Wâtts,&nbsp;agreeably to her requeſt, reviſed and publiſhed her devotions in 1737, under the title of Devout Exerciſes&nbsp;oſ the Heart in Meditation and Soliloquy, Praiſe and&nbsp;Prayer; and, in 1739, her Miſcellaneous Works, in&nbsp;proſe and verſe, were publiſhed in 2 vols 8vo, with an&nbsp;account oſ her life and writings prefixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As to her perſon, ſhe was not a regular beauty, yet poſſeſſed a large ſhare of the charms of her ſex. She&nbsp;was of a moderate ſtature, her hair of a fine colour,&nbsp;her eyes of a darkiſh grey inclining ta blue, and full of&nbsp;fire. Her complexion was very fair, and a natural bluſh&nbsp;glowed in her cheeks. She ſpoke gracefully ; her voice&nbsp;was exceedingly ſweet and harmonious ; and ſhe had a&nbsp;ſoftneſs in her aſpect which inſpired love, yet not witl&gt;-out ſome mixture of that awe and veneration which di^&nbsp;ſtinguiſhed ſenſe and virtue, apparent in the countenance, are wont to create.</span></p>
