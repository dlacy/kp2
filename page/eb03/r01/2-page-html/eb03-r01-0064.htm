<p><span class="font2">an iſland, and every two or three iſlands become an harbour. Οη the ends of the principal of theſe harbours the people have piled up great heaps of ſtones&nbsp;to ſerve as ſignals : &quot; and it is in theſe (ſays Mr Bruce)&nbsp;that the large veffels from Cairo to Jidda, equal in ſize&nbsp;to our large 74 gun-ſhipe (but from the ciſterns of ma-ſon-work built within for holding water, I ſuppoſe&nbsp;double their weight), after navigating their portion of&nbsp;the channel in the day-time, come ſafely and quietly to&nbsp;ut four o’clock in the afternoon ; and in theſe little harbours paſs the night, to ſail into the channel again next&nbsp;morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The weſtern channel of the Red Sea was choſen, in the days of the Ptolemies, for the track of the Indian&nbsp;and African. Theſe monarchs erected a great number&nbsp;of cities all along the weſtern coaſt ; and notwithſtand-ing the dangers of the navigation, we do not hear&nbsp;that it was ever abandoned on account of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the obſervations made by our author on the navigation of the Red Sea, he undertakes to point out&nbsp;a ſafe paſſage for large ſhips to the gulph of Suez, ſo&nbsp;that they may be able to judge of the propriety of their&nbsp;own courſe themſelves, without truſting implicitly to&nbsp;the pilots they meet with, who are often very ignorant&nbsp;of their profeſſion. This ſea, according to Mr Bruce,&nbsp;may be divided into four parts, of which the channel&nbsp;©ccupies two, till near the latitude of 26<sup>j</sup>, or that of&nbsp;Coſſair. Οη the weſt it is deep water, with many&nbsp;recks ; and on the eaſt it is full of iſlands, as has been&nbsp;already mentioned. Between theſe iſlands there are&nbsp;channels and harbours of deep water, where ſhips may&nbsp;be protected in any wind ; but a pilot is neceſſary io&nbsp;failing among theſe ſrom Mocha to Suez, and the voyage beſides can be continued only during part of the&nbsp;day. Ships bound to Suez without the conſent of the&nbsp;ſheriſſe of Mecca, that is, without any intention of felling their cargo at Jidda, or paying cuſtom there, ought&nbsp;to take in their freſh water at Mocha ; or it there be&nbsp;any reaſon againſt this, a few hours will carry them to&nbsp;Azab or Saba on the Abyffinian coaſt, where they may&nbsp;be plentifully ſupplied : but it muſt be remembered,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ that the people here are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Galla,</span><span class="font2"> the moſt treacherous and villanous wretches on earth.” Here not only&nbsp;•water may be procured, but plenty of ſheep, goats,&nbsp;with ſome myrrh, and incenſe in the proper ſeaſon.·—&nbsp;Great caution, however, muſt be uſed in dealing with&nbsp;the people, as even thoſe of Mocha, who are abſolutely&nbsp;neceſſary to them in their commercial dealings, cannot&nbsp;truſt them without ſurety or hoſtages. Not many years&nbsp;ago, the ſurgeon and mate of the Elgin Eaſt India-man, with ſeveral other ſailors, were murdered by theſe&nbsp;ſavages as they went aſhore to purchaſe myrrh, though&nbsp;they had a letter of ſafe conduit from the ſhekh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To ſuch as do not want to be known, our author recommends a low black iſland on the coaſt of Arabia,&nbsp;named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Camaran,</span><span class="font2"> in latitude 15<sup>0</sup> 30'. It is diſtinguiſhed by a white houſe or fortrefs on the weſt end of it ;&nbsp;where water is to be had in ſtill greater plenty than at&nbsp;Azab ; but no proviſions, or ſuch only as are very bad,&nbsp;can be procured. If it is neceſſary not to be ſeen at</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">all on the coaſt, the iſland of Fooſht is recommended by our author as having excellent water, with a ſaint&nbsp;or monk, whofe office is to keep the wells clean. This&nbsp;is one of the chain of iſlands which ſtretches almoſt&nbsp;acroſs the gulph from Loheia to Maſuah, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">aad from ac</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">tual obſervation by Mr'Bruce, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">found </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">be fituated in N. Lat. 15<sup>0</sup> 59' 43 '. E. Long. 42<sup>0</sup> 47'. From&nbsp;this to Yambo there is a ſaſe watering-place ; and there&nbsp;is an abſolute neceſſity for having a pilot before you&nbsp;come to Ras Mahomet ; becauſe, over the Ælanitic&nbsp;gulph, the mountains of Aucha, and the Cape itſelf,&nbsp;there is often a thick haze which laſts for many days&nbsp;together, and a number of ſhips are loſt by miſtaking&nbsp;the eaſtern bay or Ælanitic gulph for the entrance of&nbsp;the gulph of Suez ? the former has a ridge of rocks&nbsp;nearly acrofs it. Aſter reaching Sheduan, a large&nbsp;iſlancl, about three leagues farther in a north by weſt&nbsp;direction, there is a bare rock diſtinguiſhed by no particular name ; but ſo ſituated that ſhips ought not to&nbsp;come within three leagues of it. This rock is to be&nbsp;left to the weſtward at the diſtance juſt mentioned ; after paſſing which you meet with ſhoals forming a&nbsp;pretty broad channel, with foundings from 15 to 30&nbsp;fathoms; and again, on ſtanding directly for Tor, there&nbsp;are two other oval ſands with ſunk rocks in the channel, between which you are to ſteer. Tor may be&nbsp;known at a diſtance by two hills that ſtand near the&nbsp;water ſide ; which, in clear weather, may be ſeen ſix&nbsp;leagues off. Juſt to the ſouth-eaſt of theſe is the town&nbsp;and harbour, where there are ſome palm-trees about the&nbsp;houſes, the more remaιkable, as being the firſt that are&nbsp;ſeen on the coaſt. The foundings in the way to Tor&nbsp;harbour are clean and regular ; &quot; and, by giving the&nbsp;beacon a ſmall birth on the larboard hand, you may&nbsp;haul in a little to the northward, and anchor in five or&nbsp;fix fathom.” In ſpring-tides, it is high water at Tor&nbsp;nearly about 12 o’clock : in the middle of the gulph&nbsp;there is no perceptible tide, but at the ſides it runs at&nbsp;the rate of more than two knots in the hour. Tor itſelf is but a ſmall village, with a convent of monks belonging to thoſe of Mount Sinai. It was taken by&nbsp;Don John de Caſtro, and fortified ſoon after its diſcovery by the Portugneſe ; but has never ſince been a&nbsp;place of any confideration ; ſerving now only for a watering place to the ſhips trading to or from Suez.—&nbsp;From this place there is a diſtinct view of mounts Ho-reb and Sinai, which appear above and behind the&nbsp;others, with their tops frequently covered with ſnow in&nbsp;the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mr Bruce next proceeds to confider ſome queſtions which may be reckoned matters of curiofity rather than&nbsp;any thing elſe. Οηε of theſe is concerning the level of&nbsp;the water of this ſea itſelf, which has been ſuppofed ſeveral feet above that of the Mediterranean. &quot; To this&nbsp;(ſays our author) I anſwer, that the fact has been ſup-poſed to be ſo by antiquity, and alleged as a reaſon.&nbsp;why Ptolemy’s canal was made from the bottom of thc&nbsp;Heroopolitic gulph rather than brought due north&nbsp;acroſs the iſthmus of Suez ; in which laſt caſe it was&nbsp;feared it would ſubmerge a great part of Afia Minor..&nbsp;But who has ever attempted to verify this by experiment ? or who is capable of ſettling the difference of levels, amounting, as ſuppofed, to ſome feet and inches,&nbsp;between two points 120 miles diſtant from each other,&nbsp;over a deſert that has no fettled ſurface, but is chan-ging its height every day ? Beſides, ſince all ſeas are in&nbsp;fact but one, what is it that hinders the Indian ocean&nbsp;to flow to its level ? what is it that keeps the Indian&nbsp;ocean up ? Till this laſt branch of the queſtion is reſol-vcd, I ſhall take it for granted that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font2"> ſuch difference</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
