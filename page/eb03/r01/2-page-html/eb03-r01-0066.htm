<p><span class="font3">the moſt .eaſy is by means of the pentagraph, or paral-klogram ; but this hath its defects. See the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pen-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAGRAPH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The beſt and moſt ufual methods of reduction are as follow: i. To reduce a figure, as ABCDE (n<sup>0</sup>ι.),&nbsp;into a lefs compaſs. About the middle of the figure,&nbsp;as z, pitch on a point, and from this point draw lines&nbsp;to its feveral angles A, B, C, &amp;c. then drawing the&nbsp;line </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a b</span><span class="font3"> parallel to AB, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">b c</span><span class="font3"> parallel to BC, &amp;c. you will&nbsp;have the figure </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">αb e de</span><span class="font3"> fimilar to ABCDE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the figure </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">abode</span><span class="font3"> had been required to be enlarged, there needed nothing but to produce the lines from the&nbsp;point beyond the angles, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">z</span><span class="font3"> D, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ζ</span><span class="font3"> C, &amp;c. and to draw&nbsp;lines, viz. DC, CB, &amp;c. parallel to the ſides </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d c, cb,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce a figure by the angle of proportion,&nbsp;ſuppofe the figure ABCDE (n<sup>0</sup>2.) required to be diminiſhed in the proportion of the line AB to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a b&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(n<sup>0</sup>3.), draw the indefinite line GH (n<sup>0</sup>4.), and&nbsp;frofn G to H ſet off the line AB. Οη G defcribe&nbsp;the arch HI. Set off the line </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a b</span><span class="font3"> as a chord on HI,&nbsp;and draw GI. Then with the angle IGH, you have&nbsp;all the meafures of the figure to be drawn. Thus to&nbsp;lay down the point </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font3"> take the interval BC, and upon&nbsp;the point G deſcribe the arch KL. Alſo on the point&nbsp;G deſcribe MN ; and upon A, with the diſtance MN,&nbsp;deſcribe an arch cutting the preceding one in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font3"> which&nbsp;will determine the fide </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">b c.</span><span class="font3"> And after the ſame manner&nbsp;are the other ſides and angles to be deſcribed. The&nbsp;ſame proceſs will alſo ſerve to enlarge the figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce a figure by a ſcale. Meaſure all the&nbsp;fides of the figure, as ABCDE (n<sup>0</sup> </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.}</span><span class="font3"> by a ſcale,&nbsp;and lay down the ſame meafures refpectively from a&nbsp;fmaller fcale in the proportion required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce a map, defign, or figure, by ſquares.&nbsp;Divide the original into little fquares, and divide a freſh&nbsp;paper of the dimenfions required into the ſame number&nbsp;of ſquares, which are to be larger or leſs than the former, as the map is to be enlarged or diminiſhed. This&nbsp;done in every ſquare of the ſecond figure, draw what&nbsp;you find in its correſpondent one in the firſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reduction,</span><span class="font3"> in metallurgy, is the bringing back metalline fubſtances which have been changed into fcoriæ or aſhes, or· otherwiſe diverted of their metallic form,&nbsp;into their natural and original ſtate of metals again.&nbsp;See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Metallurgy, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I<sup>a</sup>Jfi<sup>m</sup> &gt;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chemistry,</span><span class="font3"> n<sup>0</sup> 140..&nbsp;and 320.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reduction,</span><span class="font3"> in ſurgery, denotes an operation whereby a diſlocated, luxated, or fractured bone, is reſtored to its former ſtate or place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REDUNDANCY, a fault in diſcourſe, conſiſting in the uſe of a ſuperfluity of words, words perfects&nbsp;ly fynonymous are redundant, and ought to be re-trenched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REDUNDANT, in muſic. what the French' call </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">we accordfuperflue,</span><span class="font3"> which we have tranſlated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a redundant chord</span><span class="font3"> in the article Music (from D’Alembert),&nbsp;has by others been rendered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a chord extremely ſharp,</span><span class="font3"> as&nbsp;in the tranſlation of Rameau’s Principle? of Compofi-tion. Their nature will be beſt underſtood by a few&nbsp;examples, and an account of the number of tones, ſemi-tones, or leſſer intervals, contained in each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ſecond redundant</span><span class="font3"> is compofed of a major tone, and a minor ſemitone; as </span><span class="font2">from <sub>t</sub>∕α to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fil</span><span class="font3"> ſharp. Its pro</span><span class="font2">portion is as 64 to 75«</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">third redundant</span><span class="font3"> confiſts of two tones and a ſemitone, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fa, la,</span><span class="font3"> ſharp. Its proportion is as 96 to 125.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fourth redundant</span><span class="font3"> is the ſame with the tritone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From theſe examples compared with the ſame inter-vals in their natural ſtate, the reader may form a general idea of what is meant by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">redundant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are two forts of reeds, ſays Haſſelquiſt, grow-ing near the Nile. Οηε of them has ſcarce any branches ; but is furniſhed with numerous leaves^ which are narrow, ſmooth, channelled on the upper ſurſace ; and&nbsp;the plant is about 11 feet high. The Egyptians make&nbsp;ropes ©f the leaves. They lay them in water like hemp,&nbsp;and then make them into good ſtrong cables. Theſe,&nbsp;with the bark of the date-tree, form almoit tlie only&nbsp;cable uſed in the Nile. The other fort is of great con-ſequence. It is a ſmall reed, about two or three feet&nbsp;high, full branched, with ſhort, ſharp, lancet-ſhaped&nbsp;leaves. The roots, which are as thick as the ſtem,&nbsp;creep and mat themſelves together to a conſiderable dr-ſtance. This plant ſeems uſeleſs in common life : but&nbsp;to it, continues the learned author, is the very foil of&nbsp;Egypt owing : for the matted roots have ſtopped the&nbsp;earth which floated in the waters, and thus formed, out&nbsp;of the ſea, a country that is habitable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reed,</span><span class="font3"> a term in the weſt of England for the ſtraw uſed by thatchers, which is wheat ſtraw finely combed,&nbsp;conſiſting of ſtiff, unbruiſed, and unbroken ſtalks of&nbsp;great length, carefully ſeparated from the ſtraw uſed&nbsp;for fodder by the threſher, and bound in ſheaves or&nbsp;nitches, each of which weighs 28 lb. and are fold from&nbsp;21 s. to 31 s. per hundred nitches, according to the&nbsp;ſeaſon. This is a great improvement in the art of&nbsp;thatching, as it gives a finiſh to the work which- cannot&nbsp;be attained by ſtraw, rough and tumbled together,&nbsp;without any ſeparation of the long and ſhort : it alſo&nbsp;is a readier mode of working.</span></p>
