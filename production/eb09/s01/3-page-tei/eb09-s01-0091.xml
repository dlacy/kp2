In the law of sale of personal property American law is also based upon English law. The principal differences are that the law of market overt (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Theft)</hi> is not recognized by the United States, and that an unpaid vendor is the agent of the vendee to resell on non-payment, and is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the price of resale. The law of Louisiana <hi rend="italic">{Civil Code,</hi> § 3194) gives the unpaid vendor a still greater right in his preferential claim for the price against the creditors of the purchaser, if the property still remains in the latter’s possession. Warranty of title is not carried as far as in England. United States decisions draw a distinction between goods in the possession and goods not in the possession of the vendor at the time of sale. There is no warranty of title of the latter. The Statute of Frauds has been construed in some respects differently from the English decisions. The differences will be found in Mr Benjamin’s work. As to unlawful sales, it has been held that a sale in a State where the sale is lawful is valid in a State where it is unlawful by statute, even though the goods are in the latter State.	(J. W†.)</p><p>SALEIYER (in Mancassarese <hi rend="italic">Silâyara,</hi> in Buginese <hi rend="italic">Silâja),</hi> also called <hi rend="italic">Tana-dowang</hi> (“ Land of Shrimps ”), is a Dutch island separated from the south coast of Celebes (East Indies) by a strait 8 miles wide, which in the west monsoon is used by vessels bound for the Moluccas, the Philippines, and China. With a length of 46 miles and general breadth of 9, the area is estimated at 315 square miles. Along the east side of the island is a belt of volcanic rock ; the west side is of limestone or coralline formation. The highest point seems to be Haru on the east coast, but estimates of its altitude vary from 1000 to 3000 feet. There are no navigable rivers, and many of the streams dry up in the west monsoon. Besides most of the ordinary tropical fruits, the cultivated plants comprise Indian corn, barley, potatoes, tobacco, coffee, and indigo, and among the trees are cocoanut and areng palms, <hi rend="italic">kanari, </hi>ebony, and teak (the last considered the property of the Dutch Government). Horses, buffaloes, goats, and sheep are kept, and pigs and deer exist in a wild state. The population of Saleiyer and dependencies, mainly a mixed race of Mancassars, Buginese, and natives of Luvu and Buton, was in 1869 55,147, and in 1880 66,276. They use the Mancassar language, are for the most part nominally Mahommedans (though many heathen customs survive), and support themselves by agriculture, fishing, seafaring, trade, the preparation of salt (on the south coast), and the weaving of clothing materials. Field work is largely performed by a servile class. Raw and prepared cotton, tobacco, trepang, tortoise-shell, cocoanuts and cocoanut oil, and salt are the principal articles of export.</p><p>The island is divided into nine regencies :—Tanette, Batammata (Batangmata; including the former regency of Onto), Buki, Mare- Mare, Bonêya—all five in the north—Bontobangung, Balla-bulo, Layolo, and Barambarang—in the south. Panggiliyang or Benteng on the west coast, often called also Saleiyer, is the capital of the island. It stands in 6° 3' 3" S. lat. and 120° 31' 48" E. long., and possesses the best harbour on the whole coast, being protected by Pulo Pasi or Hog Island (also Sariwa or Pulo Babi). To the Saleiyer group belong a variety of small islands, for the most part uninhabited—Tana Jampêya (the largest of all with a good anchorage at Maringi Bay), Gowang, Malimbu, &amp;c. Previous to the Dutch occupation the Saleiyers were subject to the king of Ternate.</p><p>SALEM, a British district of India, in Madras presidency, lying between 11° 1' and 12° 57' N. lat. and 77° 32' and 79° 5' E. long. It embraces an area of 7653 square miles, and is bounded on the N. by Mysore and North Arcot, on the S. by Coimbatore and Trichinopoly, on the E. by Trichinopoly and South and North Arcot, and on the W. by Coimbatore and Mysore. Except towards the south, the district is very hilly, with large plains lying between the several ranges. Salem is described as consisting of three distinct tracts of country, known as the Tálaghát, the Báramahál, and the Bálághát. The Talaghat is situated below the Eastern Ghats on the level of the Carnatic generally ; the Báramahál includes the whole Salem face of the Ghats and a wide tract of country at their base; and the</p><p>Bálághát is situated above the Ghats on the tableland of Mysore. The western part of the district is very mountainous, some of the ranges attaining an elevation of between 5000 and 6000 feet. Amongst the chief ranges are the Shevaroys, the Karáyans, the Melagiris, the Kollimalais, the Pachamalais, and the Yelagiris. The chief rivers are the Cauvery with its numerous tributaries, and the Pennar and Palar; the last, however, only flows through a few miles of the Tirupatúr <hi rend="italic">táluk,</hi> situated in the north-western corner of the district. The forests are of considerable value and their area is roughly estimated at 2251 square miles. The geological structure of the district is mostly gneissic, with a few irruptive rocks in the form of trap dykes and granite veins. Magnetic iron ore is common in the hill regions, and corundum and chromate of iron are also obtainable. The qualities of the soil differ very much ; in the country immediately surrounding the town of Salem a thin layer of calcareous and red loam generally prevails, through which quartz rocks appear on the surface in many places. The climate, owing to the great difference of elevation, varies considerably; on the hills it is cool and bracing, and for a great part of the year very salubrious ; the average rainfall is about 38 inches. Salem has about 1400 miles of road, and the length of railway line within the district is 134 miles.</p><p>In 1881 the population was 1,599,595 (males 778,483, females 821,112) ; Hindus numbered 1,531,855, Mohammedans 51,092, and Christians 16,567. Besides Salem (see below), the capital, the district contains three other towns with a population exceeding 10,000 each, viz., Daringambadi (15,426), Tirupatúr (14,278), and Shendamangalam (12,575). Of the total area of the district only 1,283,190 acres were under cultivation in 1883-84 ; but of these 137,403 acres were twice cropped. The staple crops are rice and ragi ; other important crops arc pulses and seeds. The chief industry is weaving, which is carried on in almost every large town and village. Carpets of great beauty and superior workmanship are made in the Salem jail. Good iron and steel are made, but only on a small scale. The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 was £260,364, the land-tax contributing £211,062 of the amount. Though Salem has no connected history, there are few parts of Southern India that contain more spots of interest for English students. As at present composed it was acquired by the treaty of peace with Tipu Sultan in 1792 and the partition treaty of Mysore in 1799. By the former the Talaghat and Baramahal were ceded, and by the latter the Bálághát, or what is now the Osúr <hi rend="italic">táluk.</hi></p><p>SALEM, chief town of the above district, situated in 11° 39' 10'' N. lat. and 78° 11' 47" E. long., is a busy trading place, with a considerable weaving industry. It is tolerably well built and is prettily situated on the river Tirumanimuttar, 900 feet above sea-level, in a long valley enclosed by the Shevaroy hills, which are 6 miles distant. The population of the town in 1881 was 50,667 (males 24,584, females 26,083).</p><p>SALEM, a city of the United States, capital of Essex county, Massachusetts, is built on a peninsula between North and South rivers, in 42° 31' 18" N. lat. and 70° 53' 53" W. long., 16 miles north by east of Boston, on the eastern division of the Boston and Maine Railroad. In the latter part of the 18th and the early part of the 19th century Salem was the seat of a flourishing foreign commerce, especially with the East Indies; but, its comparatively shallow harbour failing to accommodate the larger vessels of modern times, it has been supplanted by Boston and has to content itself with a good share of the coasting trade. Its industrial activity has, on the other hand, increased, and it now possesses steam cotton-mills, jute-factories, extensive tanneries, and various minor manufactories. The main interest, however, of Salem consists in its historical and literary associations and the institutions by which they are represented. Best known of these institutions is the Peabody Academy, founded in 1867 with funds provided by the well-known philanthropist. The academy at once purchased and refitted the East India Marine Hall, origin</p></body></text></TEI>
