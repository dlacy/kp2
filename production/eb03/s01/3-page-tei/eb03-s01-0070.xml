            <p>has had recourſe to the more expreſſive and energetic
                language of poetry: but</p>
            <p>Scarce the Muſe herſelſ</p>
            <p>Dares ſtretch her wing o’er this enormous maſs</p>
            <p>Of ruſhing waters; to whoſe dread expanſe,</p>
            <p>Continuous depth, and wond'rous length of courſe,</p>
            <p>Our floods are rills.</p>
            <p>"This ſtupendous object is the Burrampooter, a word which in Shanſcrit ſigniſies <hi
                    rend="italic">the ſon of Brahma; </hi>for no meaner origin could be aſſigned to
                ſo wonderful a progeny. This ſupreme monarch of Indian rivers derives its ſource
                from the oppoſite ſide of the ſame mountain from which the Ganges ſprings, and
                taking a bold ſweep towards the eaſt, in a line directly oppoſite to the courſe of
                that river, waſhes the vaſt country of Tibet, where, by way of diſtinction, it is
                denominated <hi rend="italic">Sanpoo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the river.</hi>
                Winding with a rapid current through Tibet, and, for many a league, amidſt dreary
                deſerts and regions remote from the habitations of men, it waters the borders of the
                territory of Laſſa, the reſidence of the grand Lama; and then deviating with a
                cometary irregularity, from an eaſt to a ſouth-eaſt courſe, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mighty wanderer</hi> approaches within 2OO miles of the weitem frontiers of the
                vaſt empire of China. From this point its more direct path to the ocean lay through
                the gulph of Siam; but with a deſultory courſe peculiar to itſelf, it ſuddenly turns
                to the weſt through Affam, and enters Bengal on the north-eaſt quarter. “Circling
                round the weſtern point of the Garrow mountains, the Burrampooter now takes a
                ſouthern direction; and for 6o miles before it meets the Ganges, its ſiſter in point
                of origin, but not its rival in point of magnitude, glides majeſtically along in a
                ſtream which is regularly from four to five miles wide, and but for its freſhneſs,
                Mr Rennel ſays, might paſs for an arm of the ſea. About 40 miles from the ocean
                theſe mighty rivers unite their ſtreams; but that gentleman is of opinion that their
                junction was formerly higher up, and that the accumulation of two ſuch vaſt bodies
                of water, ſcooped out the amazing bed of the Megna lake. Their preſent conflux is
                below Luckipoor; and by that confluence a body of freſh running water is produced,
                hardly equalled, and not exceeded, either in the old or the new hemiſphere. So
                ſtupendous is that body of water, that it has formed a gulph of ſuch extent as to
                contain iſlands that rival our Iſle of Wight in ſize and fertility; and with ſuch
                reſiſtleſs violence does it ruſh into the ocean, that in the rainy ſeaſon the ſea
                itſelf, or at leaſt its ſurface, is perfectly freſh for many leagues out. ”</p>
            <p>SANDWICH, a town of Kent, one of the cinque ports, and which has the title of an
                earldom. It conflits of about 1500 houſes, molt of them old, and built with wood,
                though there are a few new ones built with brick and flints. It has three long
                narrow ſtreets paved, and thirty croſs-ſtreets or alleys, with about 6000
                inhabitants, but no particular manufactory. The town is walled round, and alſo
                fortified with ditches and ramparts; but the walls are much decayed, on account of
                the harbour being ſo choaked up with fand that a ſhip of 100 tons burthen cannot get
                in. E. Long. I. 20. N. Lat. 51. 20.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Sandwich</hi><hi rend="italic"> Iſlands, </hi>a group of
                iſlands in the South Sea, lying near New Ireland, were among the laſt diſcoveries of
                captain Cook, who ſo named them in ho</p>
            <p>nour of the Earl of Sandwich, under whoſe adminiſtration theſe diſcoveries were made.
                They conſiſt of eleven iſlands, extending in latitude from 18. 54. to 22. 15. N. and
                in longitude from 150. 54. to 160. 24. W. They are called by the natives, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Owhykee Mowee, Ranai, </hi><hi rend="italic">Moretoi,</hi>
                <hi rend="smallcaps">Tahoorowa, Woahoo,</hi> ATOOI, <hi rend="italic">Neeheeheow,
                    Oreehoua, Morotinne,</hi> and TAHOORA, all inhabited except the two laſt. An
                account of the moſt. remarkable of which will be found in their alphabetical order,
                in their proper places in this work. The climate of theſe iſlands differs very
                little from that of the Weft Indies in the ſame latitude, though perhaps more
                temperate; and there are no traces of thoſe violent winds and hurricanes, which
                render the ſtormy months in the Weſt Indies ſo dreadful. There is alſo more rain at
                the Sandwich Iſles, where the mountainous parts being generally enveloped in a
                cloud, fucceſſive ſhowers fall in the inland parts, with fine weather, and a clear
                ſky, on the ſea ſhore. Hence it is, that few of thoſe inconveniences, to which many
                tropical countries are ſubject, either from heat or moiſture, are experienced here.
                The winds, in the winter months, are generally from eaſt-ſouth-eaſt to north-eaſt.
                The vegetable productions are nearly the ſame as thoſe of the other iſlands in thiſ
                ocean; but the taro root is here of a ſuperior quality. The bread-fruit trees thrive
                not in ſuch abundance as in the rich plains of Otaheite, but produce double the
                quantity of fruit. The ſugar-canes are of a very unuſual ſize, ſome of them
                meaſuring eleven inches and a quarter in circumference, and having fourteen feet
                eatable. There is alſo a root of a brown colour, ſhaped like a yam, and from ſix to
                ten pounds in weight, the juice of which is very ſweet, of a pleaſant taſte, and is
                an excellent ſubſtitute for ſugar. The quadrupeds are confined to the three uſual
                forts, hogs, dogs, and rats. The fowls are alſo of the common fort; and the birds
                are beautiful and numerous, though not various. Goats, pigs, and European ſeeds,
                were left by captain Cook; but the poſſeſſion of the goats ſoon gave riſe to a
                conteſt between two diſtricts, in which the breed was entirely deſtroyed. The
                inhabitants are undoubtedly of the ſame race that poſſeſſes the iſlands ſouth of the
                equator; and in their perſons, language, cuſtoms, and manners, approach nearer to
                the New Zealanders than to their leſs diſtant neighbours, either of the Society or
                Friendly Iſlands. They are in general about the middle ſize, and well made; they
                walk very gracefully, run nimbly, and are capable of bearing very great fatigue.
                Many of both ſexes have fine open countenances; and the women in particular have
                good eyes and teeth, with a ſweetneſs and ſenſibility of look, that render them very
                engaging, There is one peculiarity, characteriſtic of every part of theſe iſlands,
                that even in the handſomeſt faces there is a fulneſs of the noſtril, without any
                flatneſs or ſpreading of the noſe. They ſuffer their beards to grow, and wear their
                hair after various faſhions. The dreſs of both men and women nearly reſemble thoſe
                of New Zealand, and both ſexes wear necklaces of ſmall variegated ſhells. Tattowing
                the body is practiſed by every colony of this nation. The hands and arms of the
                women are alſo very neatly marked, and they have the ſingular cuſtom of tattowing
                the tip of the tongue. Like the New Zealanders, they have adopted the method of
                living together in villages, containing from an hundred to two hundred</p>
