<p><span class="font3">Lapideus, to distinguish it from the wooden Sublician bridge. The modern Ponte Rotto represents this bridge; but the existing arches&nbsp;are mainly medieval. An ancient basalt-paved road still exists,&nbsp;leading to the bridge from the Forum Boarium. The Pons Fabricius&nbsp;united the city and the island (Insula Tiberina).<sup>@@1</sup> The bridge&nbsp;derived its name from L. Fabricius, a curator viarum in 62 B.c; its&nbsp;inscription, twice repeated, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">d . fabricivs</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> . c .

Corbels to support centering were&nbsp;built in near the springing of the arches, so that they could be&nbsp;repaired or even rebuilt without a scaffolding erected in the&nbsp;river-bed. The well-preserved Pons Cestius, probably named&nbsp;after L. Cestius, praefeetus urbi in 46 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font3"> unites the island and&nbsp;the Janiculan side; on the marble parapet is a long inscription recording its restoration in 370 by Gratian, Valentinian, and Valens.<sup>@@2&nbsp;</sup>The next bridge, Ponte Sisto, is probably on the site of an ancient&nbsp;bridge called in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font3"> Pons Aurelius. Marliano gives an&nbsp;inscription (now lost) which recorded its restoration in the time of&nbsp;Hadrian. About 100 yards above this bridge have been found the&nbsp;remains of sunken piers, which are proved by an inscription </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(C.I.L.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">vi. 31545) to have belonged to the Pons Agrippae, not otherwise&nbsp;known. The Pons Aelius was built in 134 by Hadrian, to connect&nbsp;his mausoleum with the Campus Martius; it is still well preserved,&nbsp;and is now called the Ponte S Angelo (see Dante, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno,</span><span class="font3"> xviii.&nbsp;28-33). It had eight arches, of which the three in the centre were&nbsp;higher than the rest, so that the road sloped on both sides. The&nbsp;material is peperino, with travertine facings. Its inscription, now&nbsp;lost, is given in the Einsiedeln MS.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">imp . caesar . divi . tr aiani .&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PARTHICI .

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Regiones of Augustus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of the extensive growth of the city under the republic no addition was made to the four regiones of Servius till the&nbsp;reign of Augustus, who divided the city and its suburbs&nbsp;into fourteen regiones. The lists in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Curiosum</span><span class="font3"> are the chief aids in determining the limits&nbsp;of each, which in many cases cannot be done with any exactness (see Preller, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Die Regionen der Stadt Rom</span><span class="font3"> (1846) and Urlich’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Topographicus</span><span class="font3"> (Wurzburg, 1871)). Each regio was&nbsp;divided into vici or parishes, each of which formed a religious&nbsp;body, with its aedicula larum, and had magistri victorum.&nbsp;The smallest regio (No. II.) contained seven vici, the largest</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(No. XIV.) seventy-eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The list is as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Porta Capena,</span><span class="font3"> a narrow strip traversed by the Appian Way; it extended beyond the walls of Aurelian to the brook Almo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The walls of Aurelian (see fig. 7), more than 12 m. in circuit, enclosed almost the whole of the regiones of Augustus, the greater&nbsp;part of which were then thickly inhabited. This enormous&nbsp;work was begun in 271, to defend Rome against sudden&nbsp;attacks of the Germans and other northern races when the&nbsp;great armies of Rome were fighting in distant countries.<sup>@@5</sup> After the&nbsp;death of Aurelian the walls were completed by Probus in 280, and&nbsp;about a century later they were restored and strengthened by the&nbsp;addition of gate-towers under Arcadius and Honorius </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 103)/&nbsp;in place of the earlier gateways of Aurelian; this is recorded by&nbsp;existing inscriptions on three of the gates.<sup>@@6 </sup>At many periods these&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">walls suffered </span><span class="font3">much more from the attacks of the Goths (Procop.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Beil. Goth.</span><span class="font3"> iii. 22, 2^.), and were restored successively by Theodoric&nbsp;(about 500), by Belisarius (about 560), and by various popes during&nbsp;the 8th and 9th centuries, and in fact all through the middle ages.&nbsp;A great part of the Aurelian wall still exists in a more or less perfect&nbsp;state; but it has wholly vanished where it skirted the river, and a&nbsp;great part of its trans-Tiberine course is gone. The best-preserved&nbsp;pieces are between Porta Pinciana and Porta Salaria (in which&nbsp;breaches have lately been made for streets), and between the Lateran&nbsp;and the Amphitheatrum Castrense. The wall, of concrete, has the&nbsp;usual brick-facing and is about 12 ft. thick, with a guard’s passage&nbsp;formed in its thickness. Fig. 13 shows its plan: on the inside the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">passage has tall open arches, which look like those of an aqueduct, and at regular intervals of about 45 ft. massive square towers are&nbsp;built, projecting on the outside of the wall, in three storeys, the top&nbsp;storey rising above the top of the wall. The height of the wall varies&nbsp;according to the eontour of the ground; in parts it was about 60 ft.&nbsp;high outside and 40 inside. Necessaria, supported on two travertine&nbsp;corbels, projected from the top of the wall on the outside beside&nbsp;most of the towers. The Einsiedeln MS. gives a description of the&nbsp;complete circuit, counting fourteen gates, as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Porta S. Petri (at the Pons Aelius, destroyed); P. Flaminia (replaced by P. del Popolo); P. Pinciana (in use); P. Salaria (now&nbsp;P. Salara); P. Nomentana (replaced by P. Pia); P. Tiburtina&nbsp;(now P. S. Lorenzo); P. Praenestina (now P. Maggiore); P. Asinaria&nbsp;(replaced by P. San Giovanni); P. Metrovia or Metroni (closed);&nbsp;P. Latina (closed); P. Appia (now P. S. Sebastiano); P. Ostiensis&nbsp;(now P. S. Paolo). On the Janiculan side, P. Portuensis (destroyed); P. Aurelia (now Porta San Pancrazio). Besides these&nbsp;there was a gate, now closed (Porta Chiusa), to the south of the&nbsp;Castra Praetoria; and in all probability a gate on the right bank of&nbsp;the Tiber, replaced by the modern Porta Settimiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These existing gates are mostly of the time of Honorius; each is flanked by a projecting tower, and some are double, with a second&nbsp;pair of towers inside. Several have grooves for a portcullis </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(catara eta)</span><span class="font3"> in the outer arch. The handsomest gate is the P. Appia,&nbsp;with two massive outer towers, three stages high, the upper semicircular in plan. Many of the gates of Honorius have Christian&nbsp;symbols or inscriptions. The general design of all these gates is&nbsp;much the same—a central archway, with a row of windows over it&nbsp;and two flanking towers, some square, others semicircular in plan. In&nbsp;many of the gates older materials are used, blocks of tufa, travertine,&nbsp;or marble. The doors themselves swung on pivots, the bottom ones&nbsp;let into a hole in the threshold, the upper into projecting corbels.</span></p>
