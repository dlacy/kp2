<p><span class="font1">the English army in America, he has contrived without in the least knowing it to make a pathetic subject supremely ludicrous.&nbsp;But he seems to have been a very well meaning and harmless&nbsp;person, and he had one moment of remarkable inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROULERS, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rousselaere,</span><span class="font2"> a town of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders, on the Mandelbeke, a&nbsp;tributary of the Lys, 22</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2"> miles south of Ostend on the&nbsp;railway to Courtrai. From time immemorial it has been&nbsp;the seat of a great weaving industry, which now produces&nbsp;both cotton, union, and linen goods ; and it also manufactures in various other departments. The principal buildings are the town-house, the college, and the church of St&nbsp;Michel with its conspicuous Gothic tower. The population was 16,345 in 1874, and 17,219 in 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roulers is mentioned in 822 as Roslar and in 847 as Rollare. Baldwin VIII., count of Flanders, died in a house in the principal&nbsp;square of the town in 1120 on Iiisreturn from the battle of Angers.&nbsp;In 1794 Roulers was the scene of a conflict between the Austrians&nbsp;and the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROUM </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Rum)</span><span class="font2"> is the name by which the Arabs call the Romans, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ix.,</span><span class="font2"> all subjects of the Roman power. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bildd al-Rdm,</span><span class="font2"> “the lands of the Romans,” accordingly means the&nbsp;Roman empire. The parts of the old empire conquered by&nbsp;the Arabs were regarded as having ceased to be Roman,&nbsp;but the Western Christian lands were still called lands of&nbsp;the Rι'ιm, without reference to the fact that they had in&nbsp;great part ceased to pay any allegiance to the “ king of&nbsp;the Rιim,” t,β., the Byzantine emperor. &quot;When Ibn Jobair&nbsp;takes a passage in a Genoese vessel he speaks of the crew&nbsp;as Romans; and in Spain a “ Riimiya ” meant a “ Christian&nbsp;slave-girl.” Sometimes all Europe is included in the lands&nbsp;of the Riim ; at other times the northern nations are&nbsp;excluded ; sometimes again the word means the Byzantine&nbsp;empire ; and, finally, the kingdom founded by the Seljiiks,&nbsp;in lands won by them from Byzantium, is the kingdom of&nbsp;the Seljiiks of Rιim, so that Riim comes to take the&nbsp;restricted sense of Asia Minor. So Abulfeda uses the&nbsp;term. Roumelia and Roumania in like manner mean no&nbsp;more than the “Roman country” in a special limitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROUMANIA, a kingdom in the south-east of Europe between the Carpathians, the Pruth, the Black Sea, and the&nbsp;Danube. The Pruth and the Kilia mouth of the Danube&nbsp;now form the frontier with Russia. West of Silistria the&nbsp;Danube is the boundary between Roumania and Bulgaria,&nbsp;while to the east of that point the boundary is formed by&nbsp;an irregular line passing east by south to the coast about&nbsp;ten miles to the south of Mangalia. The territory thus&nbsp;shut off between tho Danube and the Black Sea is known&nbsp;as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dobrudja </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(g.v.),</span><span class="font2"> and differs in its physical features&nbsp;and products from the rest of the kingdom. It was&nbsp;given to Roumania at the close of the last Russo-Turkish&nbsp;War as a compensation for the territory of Bessarabia, east&nbsp;of the Pruth, which was then restored to Russia. The&nbsp;area of the kingdom is estimated at about 49,250 square&nbsp;miles, which is rather less than that of England without&nbsp;Wales. The greatest length of the kingdom is from east&nbsp;to west near the parallel of 45°, along which the length is&nbsp;about 350 miles. The line stretching from north-west to&nbsp;south-east between the extreme points of the kingdom is&nbsp;about fifteen miles shorter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The crescent-shaped portion of the kingdom lying between the Danube and Pruth and the Carpathians is&nbsp;tolerably uniform in its physical features. The southern&nbsp;part of the area is a plain continuous with that of&nbsp;southern Russia. Towards the interior the surface rises&nbsp;gradually but slowly until we come to the spurs of the&nbsp;Caqiathians. Tlie Roumanian frontier on this side runs&nbsp;for the most part along the very crest of the mountains,&nbsp;which have peaks rising to from 6000 to 8000 feet and&nbsp;upwards. The lowest part of this plain is that which&nbsp;stretches along the left bank of the Danube, and this also&nbsp;is the dreariest and least productive. Large tracts of it&nbsp;are marshy and subject to inundation, and even beyond&nbsp;the marshy districts the aspect of the country remains&nbsp;extremely uninviting. Agriculture is neglected ; coarse&nbsp;grasses occupy large areas; and the most conspicuous&nbsp;feature in the landscape is probably a rude well, such as&nbsp;is seen in tho pusstas of Hungary and some parts of&nbsp;southern Russia, where the general aspect of the country&nbsp;is so like what we find here. Farther inland, however,&nbsp;the appearance of the surface improves : agriculture&nbsp;becomes more general, trees (willows, alders, and poplars)&nbsp;more abundant ; on the still higher ground nearer the&nbsp;Carpathians the outward signs of comfort and prosperity&nbsp;become more and more apparent ; the vine clothes the&nbsp;hill slopes ; plums, peaches, and southern fruits are grown&nbsp;in profusion ; large forests of oak, beech, and elm reach&nbsp;to the hill tops, and various minerals form an important&nbsp;addition to the present and prospective resources of the&nbsp;country. At elevations too high for the foliage trees just&nbsp;mentioned these are succeeded by pines and firs, birches&nbsp;and larches, which ∙ crown the mountains to a height of&nbsp;5000 or 6000 feet. Extensive as the plains of Roumania&nbsp;are, 40 per cent, of the entire surface is more than a&nbsp;thousand feet above sea-level, while the greater part of the&nbsp;northern (or Moldavian) half of the crescent varies from&nbsp;300 to 1000 feet, almost all the rest of Moldavia being&nbsp;still more elevated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The superficial geology of Roumania, so far as it is known, is extremely simple, at least on the left bank of the&nbsp;Danube. Quaternary deposits are spread over all the&nbsp;plains. Among these the most important is the yellow&nbsp;loess, which covers such large areas in Hungary also, and&nbsp;which in Roumania attains in places a depth of 150 to 300&nbsp;feet. In certain parts the black soil of southern Russia&nbsp;extends into Roumania, and is important on account of&nbsp;its richness, though its depth is nowhere above 3 feet.&nbsp;Advancing inland one meets next with Miocene and&nbsp;Eocene deposits, until, in ascending the slopes of the&nbsp;Carpathians, Secondary, Primary, and crystalline rocks are&nbsp;seen to crop out in succession. The desolate plateau&nbsp;of the Dobrudja contrasts with the region on the left&nbsp;of the Danube in its geology as in other respects.&nbsp;Its basis consists of crystalline rocks, but these are&nbsp;covered with sedimentary formations of various ages.&nbsp;On the north this plateau, which is hilly and even&nbsp;mountainous, sinks down rather abruptly to the delta of&nbsp;the Danube, a congeries of alluvial marshes occupied&nbsp;chiefly by aquatic and marsh-loving birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the rivers of Roumania by far the most important is the Danube, which is navigable for large vessels&nbsp;throughout its Roumanian reach, the first obstruction to&nbsp;navigation, the celebrated Iron Gates, Occurringjust where&nbsp;it enters Roumanian territory. The breadth of the river&nbsp;is of some consequence in view of the fact that it is a&nbsp;frontier stream, and the marshes on the left bank have at&nbsp;least this advantage that they enable it to serve all the&nbsp;more effectually as a natural boundary. The plains on&nbsp;the left are traversed by numerous winding tributaries of&nbsp;the Danube, but of these the only one of importance as a&nbsp;means of communication is the Pruth, which is navigable&nbsp;for small grain-carrying vessels. The others—the Sereth,&nbsp;Jalomitza, Dambovitza, Olta—are sluggish streams, often&nbsp;half-dry, but yet at certain seasons subject to inundations,&nbsp;which unfortunately occur at a time when the crops are&nbsp;so far advanced as to be liable to be much damaged.&nbsp;In consequence of this the Government has bestowed much&nbsp;pains on the regulation of these streams, and the works&nbsp;for this purpose are rendered further serviceable by the&nbsp;fact that the Roumanian rivers can be turned to account&nbsp;for irrigation.</span></p>
