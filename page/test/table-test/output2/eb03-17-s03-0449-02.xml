 by ſome called <hi rend="italic">Upper,</hi> (to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi rend="italic">Lower</hi> Siam, under which are often included Laos, Cambodia, and Malacca), is bounded on the north by the kingdoms of Pegu and Laos; on the eaſt by Cambodia and Cochin-China ; on the ſouth by Malacca and the bay of Siam ; and on the west by the ocean. But as the opinions of geographers are extremely various concerning the ſituation and extent of moſt of the inland countries of Aſiaand Africa, neither the extent nor boundaries of Siam are yet accurately known. By ſome it is ſuppoſed to extend 553 miles in length, and 250 miles in breadth ; in ſome places it is not above 50 miles broad.</p><p>The winds blow here from the ſouth upon the coaſt of Siam, in March, April, and May ; in April the rains begin, in May and June they fall almoſt without ceasing. In July, Auguſt, and September, the winds blow from the west, and the rains continuing, the rivers overflow their banks nine or ten miles on each ſide, and for more than 150 miles up the ſtream. At this time, and more particularly in July, the tides are ſo ſtrong as to come up the river Menan as far as the city of Siam, which is ſituated 60 miles from its mouth ; and ſometimes as far as Louvo, which is 50 miles higher. The winds blow from the west and north in October, when the rain ceaſes. In November and December the winds blow dry from the north, and the waters being in a few days reduced to their ancient channels, the tides become ſo inſenſible, that the water is freſh at the mouth of the river. At Siam there is never more than one flood and one ebb in the ſpace of 24 hours. In January the wind blows from the eaſt, and in February from the eaſt and ſouth. When the wind is at eaſt, the current ſets to the west ; and, on the contrary, when the wind is at west, the currents run to the eaſtward.</p><p>As this country is ſituated near the tropic, it muſt neceſſarily be very hot ; but yet, as in other places nearly of the ſame latitude, when the ſun is vertical and ſhines with a moſt intenſe heat, the inhabitants are ſcreened by the clouds, and the air is ſo refreſhed by a deluge of rain that overflows the plains which the people chiefly inhabit, that the heat is very supportable. The cooleſt wind blows in December and January.</p><p>The vegetable produce of this country is chiefly rice and wheat, beſides tropical and a few European fruits. The Siameſe prepare the land for tillage as ſoon as the earth is ſufficiently moiſtened by the floods. They plant their rice before the waters riſe to any conſiderable height, and, as they riſe ſlowly, the rice keeps pace with them, and the ear is always above the water. They reap their corn when the water retires, and ſometimes go in boats to cut it while the waters are upon the ground. They alſo ſow rice in ſeveral parts of the kingdom that are not overflowed, and this is thought better taſted, and will keep longer, than the other ; but they are forced to ſupply theſe fields conſtantly with water, while the rice is growing, from baſins and ponds that lie about them.</p><p>They have no European fruits except oranges, lemons, citrons, and pomegranates. They have bananas, Indian figs, jaques, durions, mangoes, mangoſtans, tamarinds, ananas, and cocoa-nuts ; they have alſo abundance of pepper and ſugar-canes. The mountains are covered with trees which make good masts. The vegetable of greateſt uſe in the country is the bamboo, which grows chiefly in marſhy ſoils, and is often found of a prodigious ſize. Cotton trees are found in great numbers ; and others that yield <hi rend="italic">capoc,</hi> a very fine cotton wool, but ſo ſhort as to be unfit for spinning, though it anſwers very well for fluffing mattreſſes and pillows.</p><p>There is no country where elephants abound more than in Siam, or where they are held in greater veneration. They have a few horſes, sheep, and goats, beſides oxen and buffaloes ; but they have no good animal food except the fleſh of hogs, their beef and mutton being of a very indifferent quality.</p><p>The Siameſe are of ſmall flature, but well proportioned ; their complexions are ſwarthy : the faces of both the men and women are broad, and their foreheads, ſuddenly contracting, terminate in a point, as well as their chins. They have ſmall black eyes, hollow jaws, large mouths, and thick pale lips. Their teeth are dyed black, their noſes are ſhort and round at the end, and they have large ears, which they think very beautiful. Their hair is thick and lank, and both ſexes cut it ſo ſhort that it reaches no lower than their ears ; the women make it ſtand up on their foreheads ; and the men ſhave their beards.</p><p>People of diſtinction wear a piece of calico tied about their loins, that reaches down to their knees.— The men bring up this cloth between their legs, and tuck it into their girdles, which gives it the appearance of a pair of breeches. They have alſo a muſlin ſhirt without a collar, with wide ſleeves, no wriſtbands, and the boſom open. In winter they wear a piece of fluff or painted linen over their ſhoulders, like a mantle, and wind it about their arms.</p><p>The king of Siam is diſtinguiſhed by wearing a veſt of brocaded ſatin, with flraight ſleeves that reach down to the wriſt, under ſuch a ſhirt as we have juſt deſcribed, and it is unlawful for any ſubject to wear this dreſs unleſs he receives it from the king. They wear flippers with piked toes turned up, but no stockings. The king ſometimes preſents a military veſt to the generals ; this is buttoned before, and reaches to the knees ; but the ſleeves are wide, and come no lower than the elbows. All the retinue of the king, either in war or in hunting, are clothed in red. The king wears a cap in the form of a ſugar-loaf, encompaſſed by a coronet or circle of precious ſtones, and thoſe of his officers have a circle of gold, ſilver, or of vermilion gilt, to diſtinguiſh their quality ; and theſe caps are fattened with a flay under the chin ; they are only worn when they are in the king’s preſence, or when they preſide in courts of juſtice, and on other extraordinary occaſions. They have alſo hats for travelling ; but, in general, few people cover their heads notwithſtanding the ſcorching heat of the ſun.</p><p>The women alſo wrap a cloth about their middle, which hangs down to the calf of their legs. They cover their breaſts with another cloth, the ends of which hang over their ſhoulders. But they have no garment<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0456.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0450"/>
correſponding to a shift, nor any covering ſor their heads but their hair. The common people are almoſt naked, and wear neither ſhoes nor slippers. The women wear as many rings on the three last fingers of each hand as they can keep on, and bracelets upon their wriſts and ancles, with pendants in their ears ſhaped like a pear.</p><p>For an inferior to ſtand beſere a ſuperior is deemed inſolent ; and therefore slaves and people of inferior rank sit upon their heels, with their heads a little inclined, and their joined hands lifted up to their foreheads. In paſſing by a ſuperior they bend their bodies, joining their hands, and lifting them toward their heads in proportion to the respect they would show. When an inferior pays a visit, he enters the room ſtooping, proſtrates himſelf, and then remains upon his knees, sitting upon his heels without ſpeaking a word till he is addreſſed by the perſon whom he visits ; for he that is of the higheſt quality must always ſpeak firſt. If a perſon of rank vilits an inferior, he walks upright, and the maſter of the houſe receives him at the door, and waits on him ſo far when he goes away, but never farther.</p><p>The higheſt part of the houſe is eſteemed the moſt honourable, and no perſon cares to lodge under another’s feet. The Siameſe indeed have but one ſtory, but the rooms rise gradually, and the innermoſt, which are the higheſt, are always the moſt honourable. When the Siameſe ambaſſador came to the French court, some of his retinue were lodged in a floor over the ambaſſador’s head ; but they no ſooner knew it, than they were ſtruck with the greateſt conſternation, and ran down tearing their hair at the thoughts of being guilty of what they conſidered as ſo unpardonable a crime.</p><p>The Siameſe never permit ſuch familiarities as are practiſed by gentlemen in Europe. Eaſineſs of acceſs, and affability to inferiors, is in that part of the world thought a ſign of weakneſs, and yet they take no notice of ſome things which would be looked upon as ill breeding among us ; ſuch as belching in company, which <hi rend="italic">no</hi> man endeavours to prevent, or ſo much as holds his hand before his mouth. They have an extraordinary respect for the head, and it is the greateſt <hi rend="italic">affront to</hi> ſtroke or touch that of another perſon ; nay, their cap muſt not be uſed with too much familiarity ; for when a ſervant carries it, it is put on a ſtick and held above his head ; and when the maſter stands Rill the ſtick is ſet down, it having a foot to ſtand upon. They alſo ſhow their respect by lifting their hands to the head ; and therefore, when they receive a letter from any one for whom they have a great respect, they immediately hold it up to their heads, and ſometimes lay it upon their heads.</p><p>They are eſteemed an ingenious people, and though rather indolent than active in diſposition, they are not addicted to the voluptuous vices which often accompany a ſtate of eaſe, being remarkably chaſte and temperate, and even holding drunkenness in abhorrence.— They are, however, accounted inſolent towards their inferiors, and equally obſequious to thoſe above them ; the latter of which qualities appears to be particularly inculcated from their earliest youth. In general, their behaviour is extremely modeſt, and they are averſe to loquacity. Like the Chineſe, they avoid ſpeaking in the firſt perſon ; and when they addreſs a lady, it is always with ſome reſpectful epithet, inſinuating perſonal accompliſhments.</p><p>No man in this country learns any particular trade, but has a general knowledge of all that are commonly practiſed, and every one works six months for the king by rotation ; at which time, if he ſhould be found perfectly ignorant of the buſineſs he is ſet about, he is doomed to suffer the baſtinado. The conſequence of this burdensome service is, that no man endeavours to excel in his buſineſs, lest he ſhould be obliged to practiſe it as long as he lives for the benefit of the crown.</p><p>The government of this country is extremely oppreſſive, the king being not only ſovereign but proprietor of all the lands, and chief merchant likewiſe ; by which means he monopolizes almost the whole traffic, to the great prejudice of his ſubjects. The crown is said to be hereditary, but it is often transferred by revolutions, on account of the exorbitant abuſe of power in thoſe who exerciſe the royal office. In his palace, the king is attended by women, who not only prepare his food, and wait on him at table, but even perform the part of valets, and put on all his clothes, except his cap, which is conſidered as too ſacred to be touched, by any hand but his own. He ſhows himſelf to the people only twice a-year, when he diſtributes his alms to the talapoins or prieſts ; and on thoſe occaſions he always appears in an elevated ſituation, or mounted on the back of an elephant. When he takes the diverſion of hunting, he is as uſual attended by his women on foot, preceded by a guard of 200 men, who drive all the people from the roads through which they are to paſs ; and when the king stops, all his attendants fall upon their faces on the ground.</p><p>All their proceedings in law are committed to writing, and none is ſuffered to exhibit a charge againſt another, without giving ſecurity to proſecute it, and anſwer the damages if he does not prove the fact againſt the person accuſed. When a perſon intends to proſecute another, he draws up a petition, in which he ſets forth his complaint, and preſents it to the <hi rend="italic">nai,</hi> or heal of the band to which he belongs, who tranſmits it to the governor ; and if the complaint appears frivolous, the proſecutor, according to the laws of the country, ſhould be punished ; but the magiſtrates generally encourage proſecutions on account of the perquiſites they bring to their office.</p><p>Every thing being prepared for hearing, the parties are ſeveral days called into court, and persuaded to agree ; but this appears to be only a matter of form. At length the governor appoints a day for all parties to attend ; and being come into court, the clerk reads the proceſs and opinion of his associates, and then the governor examines upon what reaſons their opinions are founded ; which being explained to him, he proceeds to paſs judgment.</p><p>When ſuſſicient proofs are wanting, they have recourſe to an ordeal trial, like that of our Saxon anceſtors : both the plaintiff and the defendant walk upon burning coals, and he that eſcapes unhurt is adjudged to be in the right : ſometimes the proof is made by putting their hands in boiling oil ; and in both theſe trials, by ſome peculiar management, one or the other is ſaid to remain unhurt. They have alſo a proof by water,</p></div></body></text></TEI>
