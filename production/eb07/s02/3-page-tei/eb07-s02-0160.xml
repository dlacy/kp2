It breeds a small but handsome race of horses. The population is estimated by Sir George Staunton at twenty-seven millions.</p><p>SETH, the third son of Adam, the father of Enoch, was born 3874 before Christ, and lived 912 years.</p><p>SETHIANS, in <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> Christian heretics, who were so called because they paid divine worship to Seth, whom they looked upon as Jesus Christ the son of God, but who was made by a third divinity, and substituted in the room of the two families of Abel and Cain, which had been destroyed by the deluge. These heretics appeared in Egypt in the second century ; and as they were addicted to all sorts of debauchery, they did not want followers, and continued in Egypt above two hundred years.</p><p>SETON, in <hi rend="italic">Surgery,</hi> a few horse hairs, small threads, or large packthread, drawn through the skin, chiefly the neck, by means of a large needle or probe, with a view to restore or preserve health.</p><p>Experience shows that setons are useful in catarrhs, inflammations, and other disorders, and particularly those of the eyes ; to which may be added, severe headachs, with stupor, drowsiness, epilepsies, and even apoplexy itself.</p><p>SETTEE, in sea-language, a vessel very common in the Mediterranean, with one deck and a long sharp prow. They carry some two masts, and some of them three, without top-masts. They have generally two masts, equipped with triangular sails, commonly called lateen sails. The least of them are of sixty tons burden. They serve to transport cannon and provisions for ships of war, and the like. These vessels are peculiar to the Mediterranean Sea, and are usually navigated by Italians, Greeks, or Mahommedans.</p><p>SETTING, in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> the withdrawing of a star or planet, or its sinking below the horizon. Astronomers and poets make three different kinds of setting of the stars, viz. the cosmical, acronycal, and heliacal.</p><p>SETTING, in nautical language. To set the land or the sun by the compass, is to observe how the land bears on any point of the compass, or on what point of the compass the sun is ; also, when two ships sail in sight of each other, to mark on what point the chased bears, is termed <hi rend="italic">setting the chase by the compass.</hi></p><p>SETTLE, a town of the parish of Giggleswick, in the wapentake of Staincliff and Ewcross, in the west riding of the county of York, 253 miles from London. Its situation is very romantic, on the river Ribble, among the hills that separate the counties of York and Lancaster. There is a large market-place, well attended on Thursdays. Near the town is the curious phenomenon of an ebbing and flowing well. In the neighbourhood arc some curious Roman antiquities. The population amounted in 1821 to 1508, and in 1831 to 1627.</p><p>SETUVAL, or Sτ <hi rend="smallcaps">Ubes,</hi> as it is called by the English and Dutch sailors that repair to it. This city is a seaport in the province of Estremadura, and the corregimento of its own name, in the kingdom of Portugal. The harbour is five leagues to the eastward of Cape Espichel. It has a shoal-bar, which extends outwards to the distance of half a league. On the western side of the entrance is a peaked height, 1350 feet above the level of the sea. The eastern side is low, with a very narrow passage, so that no written notices can be sufficient to guide the mariner ; but the services of a pilot are indispensable, though when entered it is the best harbour in the whole kingdom.</p><p>The possession taken of this place by the fleet of the Emperor of Brazil, in the late war of succession in Portugal, led to the conquest of Lisbon, the capital, and then to the submission of the rest of the kingdom.</p><p>The chief article of export is salt, from the evaporation of the sea-water by the heat of the sun. There are more than 500 pits on the banks of the river Jabo, where this</p><p>salt is formed by the hand of nature. The quantity annually collected amounts to about 200,000 tons, nearly one half of which is sent to Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia. It is stated that from 400 to 500 foreign vessels enter the port annually. G∞d wine, to the extent of 1800 pipes, is made in the neighbourhood, one half of which is exported. Oranges and lemons also afford articles for foreign trade.</p><p>The city contained, a few years ago, five churches, eleven monasteries, a hospital, a poor-house, about 3000 dwelling- houses, and 14,820 inhabitants.</p><p>SEVASTOPOL, known formerly by the Turkish name Achtiar, an important naval arsenal and city belonging to Russia, in the peninsula of the Crimea. It is situated at the south-west point, has an extensive and commodious port, and its depth renders it secure at all seasons and during all winds. By a decree of 1804, it was declared that Sevastopol was to be considered thereafter as a port exclusively for the use of the imperial navy ; merchant-ships are therefore not admitted, unless forced in by stress of weather, or when requiring repairs from accidents. The fortifications do not surround the city, but it is defended by six strong batteries towards the sea, and has commonly a garrison of 4000 men.</p><p>The fleet, whose head-quarters is at this place, consisted in 1793 of eight ships of the line and twelve frigates and smaller vessels; in the year 1817 it had reached twelve ships of the line, carrying 918 guns, four frigates with 164 guns, seventeen brigs, and eighteen smaller vessels ; in 1823 it consisted of fourteen ships of the line, ten frigates, and a number of small craft ; and in 1838 it had been augmented to sixteen ships of the line, with a large number of frigates, gun-boats, &amp;c.</p><p>The city has the appearance of an amphitheatre on the south side of the port : its white walls and gaudy domes, rising amid green trees, give it a peculiarly lively look. The streets are wide and regular, and intersect each other at right angles, but none of them have any pavement. The houses have of late been increasing in number, and are built in the modern style of Italian architecture. A public garden, with terraces rising one above the other, has been lately formed upon a rising elevation in the middle of the town, and has a very pleasing effect.</p><p>The place is well supplied with the necessaries, and even the luxuries, of life ; but good water is not abundant, and fuel is scarce. The population, ten years ago, amounted to 22,000 persons; not more than one tenth were civil inhabitants. Since that period, with the increase of the marine, the numbers have probably been augmented. The lazaretto is situated in long. 33. 29. E. and lat. 44. 35. N.</p><p>SEVEN <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands,</hi> a cluster of very small isles, extending along the north coast of the island of Banca, from which they are separated by a navigable channel. Long. 105. 20. E. Lat. 1. 10. S.</p><p>SEVENOAKS, a town of the county of Kent, in the lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, and hundred of Codsheath, twenty- three and a half miles from London. It is pleasantly situated on the side and top of a hill. It has a good grammar- school. There is a good market on Saturdays. Adjoining to the town is the magnificent castle and park of Knowle, the ancient seat of the Dukes of Dorset, but now the property of the Earl of Plymouth. The population, including Riverhead and Weald, amounted in 1821 to 3942, and in 1831 to 4709.</p><p>SEVEN <hi rend="smallcaps">Stabs,</hi> a common denomination given to the cluster of stars in the neck of the sign Taurus, the bull, and properly called the <hi rend="italic">Pleiades.</hi> They are so called from their number, seven, which appear to the naked eye, though some eyes can discover only six of them ; but by the aid of telescopes there appears to be a great multitude of them.</p></body></text></TEI>
