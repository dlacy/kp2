<p><span class="font0">of the Caſpian ſea it bends to the ſouth-eaſt, traverſes weſtern Tartary, and paſſing between theTengis andZai-zan lakes, ſt then branches to the eaſt and ſouth. The&nbsp;eaſtern branch runs to the ſhores of Korea and Kamt-ſchatka. The ſouthern branch traverſes Turkeſtan and&nbsp;Thibet, ſeparating them from India, and at the head of&nbsp;the kingdom of Ava joins an arm ſtretching from the&nbsp;great eaſtern branch, and here forms the centre of a&nbsp;very ſtngular radiation. Chains of mountains iſſue from&nbsp;it in every direction. Three or four of them keep very&nbsp;cloſe together, dividing the continent into narrow flips,&nbsp;which have each a great river flowing in the middle,&nbsp;and reaching to the extreme points of Malacca, Cambodia, and Cochin-china. From the ſame central point&nbsp;proceeds another great ridge due eaſt, and paſſes a little&nbsp;north of Canton in China. We called this a ſingular&nbsp;centre : for though it fends off ſo many branches, it is&nbsp;by no means the moſt elevated part of the continent.&nbsp;In the triangle which is included between the firſt ſouthern ridge (which comes from between the lakes Tanges andZaizan), the great eaſtern ridge, and its branch&nbsp;which almoſt unites with the ſouthern ridge, lies the&nbsp;Boutan, and part of Tibet, and the many little rivers&nbsp;which occupy its ſurface, flow ſouthward and eaſtward,&nbsp;uniting a little to the north of the centre often mentioned, and then paſs through a gorge eaſtward into&nbsp;China. And it is farther to be obſerved, that theſe&nbsp;great ridges do not appear to be ſeated on the higheſt&nbsp;parte of the country ; for the rivers which correſpond&nbsp;to them are at no great diſtance from them, and receive&nbsp;their chief ſupplies ſrom the other ſides. This is remarkably the caſe with the great Oby, which runs almoſt parallel to the ridge from the lakes to Nova Zem-bla. It receives its ſupplies from the eaſt, and indeed&nbsp;it has its ſource far eaſt. The higheſt grounds (if we&nbsp;except the ridges of mountains which are boundaries)&nbsp;of the continent ſeem to be in the country of the Cal-mucs, about 95<sup>δ</sup> eaſt from London, and latitude 43° or&nbsp;4f<sup>0</sup> north. It is repreſented as a fine though ſandy&nbsp;country, having many little rivers which loſe themſelves&nbsp;in the fand, or end in little ſalt lakes. This elevation&nbsp;ſtretches north-eaſt to a great diſtance ; and in this&nbsp;track we find the heads of the Irtiſh, Selenga, and Tun-guikaia (the great feeders of the Oby), the Olenitz, the&nbsp;Lena, the Yana, and ſome other rivers which all go off&nbsp;to the north. On the other ſide we have the great river Amur, and many ſmaller rivers, whoſe names are&nbsp;not familiar. The Hoangho, the great river of China,&nbsp;riſes on the ſouth ſide of the great eaſtern ridge we have&nbsp;ſo often mentioned. This elevation, which is a continuation of the former, is ſomewhat of the ſame complexion, being very ſandy, and at preſent is a deſert of&nbsp;prodigious extent. It is deſcribed, however, as inter-ſperſed with vaſt tracks of rich paſture ; and we know&nbsp;that it was formerly the reſidence of a great nation,&nbsp;who came ſouth, by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Turks,</span><span class="font0"> and poſſeſſed&nbsp;themſelves of moſt of the richeſt kingdoms of Aſia. In&nbsp;tire ſouth-weſtern extremity of this country are found&nbsp;remains not only of barbaric magnificence, but even of&nbsp;cultivation and elegance. It was a profitable privilege&nbsp;granted by Peter the Great to ſome adventurers to&nbsp;ſearch theſe ſandy deſerts ſor remains of former opulence, and many pieces of delicate workmanſhip (tho<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>not in a ſtyle which we would admire) in go'14! and ſil</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ver were found. Vaults were found buried in the fand filled with written papers, in a character wholly unknown ; and a wall was diſcovered extending ſeveral&nbsp;miles, built with hewn ſtone, and ornamented with corniche and battlements. But we are forgetting ourſelves,&nbsp;and return to the conſideration of the diſtribution of the&nbsp;rivers on the ſurface of the earth. A great ridge of&nbsp;•mountains begins at the ſouth-eaſt corner of the Euxine&nbsp;Sea, and proceeds eaſtward, ranging along the ſouth&nbsp;ſide of the Caſpian, and ſtill advancing unites with the&nbsp;mountains firſt mentioned in Thibet, ſending off ſome&nbsp;branches to the ſouth, which divide Perſia, India, and&nbsp;Thibet. From the ſouth ſide of this ridge flow the Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Ganges, &amp;c. and from the north&nbsp;the ancient Oxus and many unknown ſtreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a remarkable circumſtance in this quarter of the globe. Although it ſeems to be neareſt to the&nbsp;greateſt elevations, it ſeems alſo to have places of the&nbsp;greateſt depreſſion. We have already ſaid that the&nbsp;Caſpian Sea is lower titan the ocean. There is in its&nbsp;neighbourhood another great baſon of ſalt water, the&nbsp;lake Aral, which receives the waters of the Oxus or&nbsp;Gihon, which were ſaid to have formerly run into the&nbsp;Caſpian Sea. There cannot therefore be a great difference in the level of theſe twobaſons; neither have they&nbsp;any outlet, tho’ they receive great rivers. There is another great lake in the very middle of Perſia, the Zare&nbsp;or Zara, which receives the river Hindemend, of near&nbsp;250 miles length, beſides other ſtreams. There is an«&nbsp;other ſuch in Aſia Minor. The ſea of Sodom and&nbsp;Gomorrah is another inſtance. And in the high countries we mentioned, there are many ſmall ſalt lakes, which&nbsp;receive little rivers, and have no outlet. The lake Zara in Perſia, however, is the only one which indicates a&nbsp;conſiderable hollow of the country. It is now aſcer- '&nbsp;tained by actual furvey, that the fest of Sodom is conſiderably higher than the Mediterranean. This feature&nbsp;is not, however, peculiar to Aſia. It obtains alſo in&nbsp;Africa, whoſe rivers we now proceed to mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of them, however, we know very little. The Nile indeed is perhaps better known than any river out of&nbsp;Europe ; and of its ſource and progreſs we have given&nbsp;a full account in a ſeparate article. See Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the regiſter of the weather kept by Mr Bruce at Gondar in 1770 and 177r, it appears that the greateſt&nbsp;rains are about the beginning of July. He ſays that at&nbsp;an average each month after June it doubles its rains.&nbsp;The caliſh or canal is opened at Cairo about the 9th&nbsp;of Auguſt, when the river has riſen 14 peeks (each 21&nbsp;inches), and the waters begin to decreaſe about the&nbsp;I oth of September. Hence we may form a conjecture&nbsp;concerning the time which the water employs in coming&nbsp;from Abyſſinia. Mr Bruce ſuppoſes it 9 days, which ſup*&nbsp;poſes a velocity not leſs than 14 feet in a ſecond; a thing&nbsp;paſt belief, and inconſiſtent with all our notions. The&nbsp;general ſlope of the river is greatly diminiſhed by ſeveral&nbsp;great cataraéts ; and Mr Bruce expreſsly ſays, that he&nbsp;might have come down from Sennaar to the cataraéts&nbsp;of Syene in a boat, and that it is navigable for boats&nbsp;far above Sennaar. He came ſrom Syene to Cairo&nbsp;by water. We apprehend that no boat would venture&nbsp;down a ſtream moving even fix feet in a ſecond, and&nbsp;none could row up if the velocity was three feet.&nbsp;As the waters begin to decreaſe about the 10th of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
