<p><label>REVERSAL</label> <hi rend="italic">oſ</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Judgment,</hi> inlaw. A judgment may be falſiſied, reverſed, or voided, in the firſt place; <hi rend="italic">without a writ of error,</hi> for matters foreign fo or <hi rend="italic">dehors</hi> the record, that is, not apparent upon the face of it ; ſo that they cannot be affigned for error in the ſuperior court, which can only judge from what appears in the record itſelf ; and therefore, if the whole record be not certified, or not truly certified, by the inferior court, the party injured thereby (in both civil and criminal cafes) may allege a diminution of the record, and cauſe it to be rectified. Thus, if any judgment whatever be given by perſons who had no good commiſſion to pro-ceed againſt the perſon condemned, it is void ; and may be falfified by ſhewing the ſpecial matter, without writ of error. As, where a commiſſion iffues to A and B, and twelve others, or any two of them, of which A or B ſhall be one, to take and try indictments ; and any of the other twelve proceed without the interpoſition or preſence of either A or B : in this cafe all proceedings, trials, convictions, and judgments, are void for want of a proper authority in the commiſſioners, and may be falſiſied upon bare inſpection, without the trouble of a writ of error ; it being a high miſdemeanour in the judges fo proceeding, and little (if any thing) ſhort of murder in them all, in caſe the perſon ſo attainted be executed and ſuffer death. So likewiſe if a man pur*</p><p>chafes land of another ; and afterwards the vender is <hi rend="sub">i</hi> either by outlawry or his own confeſſion, convicted and attainted of treaſon or felony previous to the ſale or alienation ; whereby ſuch land becomes liable to forfeit-ure or eſcheat : now, upon any trial, the purchaſer is at liberty, without bringing any writ of error, to falſify not only the time of the felony or treaſon ſuppofed, but the very point of the felony or treafon itſelf ; and is not concluded by the confeffion or the outlawry of the vender, though the vender himſelf is concluded, and not ſuffered now to deny the fact, which he has by confeſſion or flight acknowledged. But if ſuch attainder of the vender was by verdict, on the oath of his peers, the alienee cannot be received to falſify or contradict the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of the crime committed ; though he is at liberty to prove a miſtake in <hi rend="italic">time,οx</hi> that the offence was committed after the alienation, and not before..</p><p>Secondly, a judgment may be reverfed, <hi rend="italic">by writ of error,</hi> which lies from all inferior criminal juriſdictions to the court of king’s-bench, and from the king’s-bench to the hαufe of peers ; ,and may be brought for notorious miſtakes in the judgment or other parts of the record : as where a man is found guilty of perjury, and receives the judgment of felony, or for other leſs palpable errors ; fuch as any irregularity, omiffion, or want of form in the proceſs of outlawry, or proclama-tions ; the want of a proper addition to the defendant’s name, according to the ſtatute of additions ; for not properly naming the ſheriff or other officer of the court, or not duly deſcribing where his county-court was held: for laying an offence, committed in the time of the late king, to be done againſt the peace of the preſent ; and for many other ſimilar. causes, which (though allowed out of tenderneſs to life and liberty) are not much to the credit or advanv⅛meffΓ of the national juſtice.—-Theſe writs of error, i⅛ reverſe judgments in caſe of.</p><p>4</p>

<p>miſdemeanours, are not to be allowed of courſe, but on ſufficient probable cauſe ſhown to the attorney-general ; and then they are underſtood to be grantable of common right, and <hi rend="italic">ex debito jufitii&lt;e.</hi> But writs of error to reverſe attainders in capital cafes are only allowed <hi rend="italic">ex gratia ;</hi> and not without expreſs warrant under the king’s ſign-manual, or at leaſt by the conſent of the at· torney-general. Theſe therefore can rarely be brought by the party himſelf, eſpecially where he is attainted for an offence againſt the ſtate : but they may be brought by his heir or executor after his death, in more favourable times ; which may be fome conſolation to his fa∙ mily. But the eaſier and more effectual way is,</p><p>Laſtly, to reverſe the attainder by act of parliament. This may be and hath been frequently done upon mo-tives of compaffion, or perhaps the zeal of the times, after a fudden revolution in the government, without examining too cloſely into the truth or validity of the errors affigned. And fometimes, though the crime be univerſally acknowledged and confeffed, yet the merits of the criminal’s family ſhall after his death obtain a reſtitution in blood, honours, and eſtate, or ſome or one of them, by act of parliament ; which (ſo far as it ex-tends) has all the effect of reverfing the attainder, with-out caſting any reflections upon the juſtice of the preceding ſentence. See Attainder.</p><p>The effect of fallifying or reverſing an outlawry £¾ that the party ſtiali be in the ſame plight as if he had appeared upon the <hi rend="italic">capias :</hi> and, if it be before plea pleaded, he ſhall be put to plead to the indictment ; if, after conviction, he ſhall receive the ſentence of the law; for all the other proceedings, except only the proceſs of outlawry for his non-appearance, remain good and effectual as before. But when judgment, pronounced upon conviction, is falſified or reverſed, all former pro-ceedings are abſolutely ſet aſide, and the party ſtands as if he had never been at all accuſed ; reſtored in his cre-dit, his capacity, his blood, and his eſtates : with regard to which laſt, though they be granted away by the crown,, yet the owner may enter upon the grantee, with ■ as little ceremony as he might enter upon a diffeiſor.— But he ſtill remains liable to another proſecution for the ſame offence : for, the ſirſt being erroneous, he never was in jeopardy thereby.</p>
