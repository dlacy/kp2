Dr. Thomson of Glasgow examined the chemical constitution of hot-blast iron, and he gives the following as the result of his inquiry :</p><p>“ (1.) The specific gravity of hot-blast iron is greater than that of cold-blast.</p><p>“ The following are the specific gravities of eight specimens of cold blast iron :</p><p><ref target="TOC \o &#34;1-5&#34; \h \z">1st.

Clyde Iron Works	7·0028</p><p>“ The specific gravity of the	 Muirkirk iron is considerably less</p><p>than of that smelted at Carron and the Clyde Iron Works ; the mean of the eight specimens is 6·7034.</p><p>“ It has been hitherto supposed that the difference between cast- iron and malleable iron consists in the presence of carbon in the former, and its absence from the latter ; in other words, that cast iron is a carburet of iron. But in all the specimens of cast iron which we analysed we constantly found several other ingredients besides iron and carbon. Manganese is pretty generally present in minute quantity, though in one specimen it amounted to no less a quantity than 7 per cent. ; its average amount is 2 per cent. <hi rend="italic">Sili- con</hi> is never wanting, though its amount is exceedingly variable, the average quantity is about 1<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">5</hi> per cent. ; some specimens contained 31 per cent. of it, while others contain less than a half per cent. Aluminum is very rarely altogether absent, though its amount is more variable than that of silicon. Its average amount is 2 per cent. ; sometimes it exceeds 4<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> per cent., and sometimes it is not quite <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">1000</hi>th part of the weight of the iron.</p><p>“ Calcium and magnesium are sometimes present, but very rarely, and the quantity does not much exceed <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">5</hi>th per cent. In a specimen of cast iron which I got from Mr. Neilson, and which he had smelted from pyrites, there was a trace of copper, showing that the pyrites employed was not quite free from copper ; and in a specimen from the Clyde Iron-Works there was a trace of sulphur. The following table exhibits the composition of six different specimens of cast iron.

I examined only one specimen of cast iron, No. 2. It was an old specimen, said to have come from Sweden, but I have no evidence of the correctness of this statement. Its specific gravity was 7∙1633 higher than any specimens of cold-blast iron, No. 1. Its constituents were.</p><p>Iron,	 93·594</p><p>Manganese	 0∙708</p><p>Carbon,					 .3·080</p><p>Silicon,	 1·262</p><p>Aluminum,	 0·732</p><p>Sulphur			 0 038—99·414</p><p>“ The presence of sulphur in this specimen leads to the suspicion that it is not a Swedish specimen ; for as the Swedish ore is magnetic iron, and the fuel charcoal, the presence of sulphur in the iron is very unlikely.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>“ In this specimen, the atoms of iron and manganese are to those of carbon, silicon, and aluminum, in the proportion of 4<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> to one, instead of 3<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> to one, as in cast-iron No. 1.</p><p>“ The atoms of carbon, silicon, and aluminum, approach the proportions of 7, 2, and 1, so that in cast-iron, No, 2. judging from one specimen, there is a greater proportion of carbon, compared with the silicon and aluminum, than in cast-iron, No. 1.</p><p>“ Mr. Tennent analyzed a specimen of hot blast-iron, No. 2, from Gartsherry. Its specific gravity was 6·9106, and iu constituents, Atoms.</p><p>Iron	  90·542	 25·86</p><p><ref target="TOC \o &#34;1-5&#34; \h \z">Manganese,	 2·764	0·78	</ref></p><p>Carbon,	 3·094	4 05	</p><p>Silicon	 0·680 	0·68	</p><p>Aluminum,	 2'894	2·31	</p><p>Sulphur,	 0·023	0·011</p><p>99·997</p><p>So that it resembles cast-iron, No. 1, in the proportion of its constituents. The carbon is almost the same as in cold-blast iron, No, 2 but the proportion of aluminum is four times as great, while the silicon is little more than half as much. The atomic ratios are, carbon, 4; silicon, 0·67 ; aluminum, 2·28.</p><p>“3. Five specimens of hot-blast cast iron, No. 1, were analysed. Two of these were fromCarron,and three from the Clyde Iron- Works, where the hot-blast originally began ; and where, of course, it has been longest in use. The specific gravity of these specimens was found to be as follows :</p><p>1st.	From	Clyde Works	7·0028</p><p>2d.	From	Carron,	7·0721</p><p>3d.	From	Carron	 7·0721</p><p>4th∙	From	Clyde Works,.	7·1022</p><p>Mean,	 7·0623</p><p>“ It appears from this, that the hot-blast increases the specific gravity of cast-iron by about <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">22</hi>nd part. It approaches nearer the apecific gravity of east iron No. 2, smelted by cold air, than to that of No. 1.</p><p>“ The following table exhibits the constituents of these four specimens.</p><table><row><cell/><cell>Clyde.</cell><cell>Carron.</cell><cell>Carron.</cell><cell>Clyde.</cell><cell>Clyde.</cell></row><row><cell>Iron,	</cell><cell>97·096</cell><cell>95·422</cell><cell>96·09</cell><cell>94·906</cell><cell>94·345</cell></row><row><cell>Mangnnese,...</cell><cell>0∙332</cell><cell>0∙336</cell><cell>0∙4l</cell><cell>0·160</cell><cell>31·20</cell></row><row><cell>Carbon,	</cell><cell>2·460</cell><cell>2∙400</cell><cell>2∙48</cell><cell>l∙560</cell><cell>1·416</cell></row><row><cell>Silicon,	</cell><cell>0·280</cell><cell>1∙820</cell><cell>1∙49</cell><cell>1·322</cell><cell>0·520</cell></row><row><cell>Aluminum,...</cell><cell>0∙385</cell><cell>0·438</cell><cell>0∙26</cell><cell>1 374</cell><cell>0·599</cell></row><row><cell>Magnesium,..</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>0’792</cell><cell>...</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>100·55</cell><cell>100∙466</cell><cell>100·73</cell><cell>100∙174</cell><cell>100·</cell></row></table><p>The mean of these analyses gives u«,</p><p>Atom.</p><p>Iron	 95·584 or 27·31</p><p>Manganese,	 0·87l	or	0·249 } 6·5</p><p>Carbon	 2·099	or	2·79 </p><p>Silicon	 1∙086	or	1∙086</p><p>Aluminum	 0·422	or	0<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>337 }1·</p><p>101∙985</p><p>Or. in the proportion of 6<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> atoms of iron and manganese to I atom of carbon, silicon, and aluminum.
