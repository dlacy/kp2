<p><span class="font0">there had been no decisive battles. The Turks had been defeated owing to the incapacity of their leaders, none of whom&nbsp;had previously commanded an army organized according to&nbsp;modem ideas. They were ignorant of strategic principles.&nbsp;Then, again, the interference with the generals in the field by&nbsp;the authorities at Constantinople had in each case resulted&nbsp;in the disasters which invariably follow the attempt of civilian&nbsp;amateurs to control warlike operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the Russian side, the enemy had been at first despised, and consequently the forces originally employed were inadequate,&nbsp;which meant subsequent delays, losses and expense. The&nbsp;command of the sea had proved of little value to the Turks.&nbsp;Their flotilla rendered them no assistance. In the early stages&nbsp;it could have materially assisted by landing reconnoitring&nbsp;parties N. of the Danube, and by interfering with the Russians&nbsp;when crossing the river. The Russian bridge offered a tempting objective throughout the campaign, but commanders&nbsp;with the requisite dash and initiative were not forthcoming.&nbsp;The defeat of the Turks was due in the first place to the failure&nbsp;of their politicians to ensure the adequate organization and training of the army during peace time, in the second place to the want&nbsp;of a commander who had educated himself to undertake the&nbsp;responsibilities entrusted to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. H. V. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A separate, campaign had been waged, as before, in Asia Minor. Here the Turks under Mukhtar Pasha had 57,000 men in two corps,&nbsp;the one on the side of Batoum and Ardahan, the other between&nbsp;Erzerum and Kars. His opponent, Loris Melikov, had at first only&nbsp;some 28,000 infantry, but a disproportionate number of Cossack&nbsp;Sotnias. The Russians advanced in three weak columns. On the&nbsp;17th of May after bombardment the right column stormed Ardahan.&nbsp;The right and centre columns then closed inwards upon Kars, which&nbsp;they besieged, but the siege was given up in July, after Mukhtar,&nbsp;advancing to its relief with 35,000 men, had repulsed Melikov’s&nbsp;attack at Zivin (June 26th). The left column occupied Bayazid&nbsp;without difficulty, but when it had proceeded thence on the&nbsp;Erzerum road the Russian garrison was blockaded by the Turks&nbsp;and the column retraced its steps to relieve the place. After this&nbsp;it halted at Igdir in the Araxes valley. Meanwhile the Turks on&nbsp;the coast had advanced, in concert with their fleet, and raised&nbsp;an insurrection amongst the Mahommedans of the littoral. They&nbsp;were eventually repulsed, but the insurrection was not completely&nbsp;suppressed until the summer of 1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In August Mukhtar, who had followed up Melikov’s retreat from Kars, and won the victory of Kizil-Tepe, led 30,000 men in front of&nbsp;this position, and behind them the Kars garrison of 10,000. Ismail&nbsp;on the Bayazid side had 40,000 Dervish, at Batoum 17,000. But&nbsp;after an interval of two months Melikov was reinforced, while drafts&nbsp;for the armies in Europe were taken from Mukhtar, and the grand-duke Michael, assuming command of the Russians, defeated his&nbsp;opponent completely in the battle of the Aladja Dagh (Oct. 15th).&nbsp;The remnants of Mukhtar’s army retreated on Erzerum, and while&nbsp;part of the Russian army besieged Kars, and part attempted to cut&nbsp;off the retreat of Ismail on the Bayazid road, while the corps from&nbsp;the Araxes valley followed the latter up. Ismail slipped past&nbsp;them, however, and rejoined Mukhtar at Erzerum. But the two&nbsp;together were no longer able to resist the superior numbers of the&nbsp;Russians, who defeated them in a last battle at Dexe Boyun&nbsp;(Nov. 4th). Kars was stormed on the night of the 1 ith of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUST (O.E. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rust,</span><span class="font0"> a word which appears in many Teutonic languages, cf. Du. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roest,</span><span class="font0"> Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rost}\</span><span class="font0"> in origin it is allied with&nbsp;“ ruddy ” and “red,” the reddish-brown powdery substance&nbsp;which forms on the surface of iron or steel exposed to atmospheric corrosion. Formerly the process was regarded as&nbsp;oxidation pure and simple, and, although it was known that iron&nbsp;did not rust in dry air, yet no attempt was made to explain&nbsp;why water was necessary to the action. F. Crace-Calvert in&nbsp;1871 showed that the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere was a&nbsp;factor; and in 1888 Crum Brown published the theory—&nbsp;termed the “ carbonic acid theory that water and carbon&nbsp;dioxide react with iron to form ferrous carbonate and hydrogen,&nbsp;the ferrous carbonate being subsequently oxidized by moist&nbsp;oxygen to ferric hydrate and regenerating carbon dioxide,&nbsp;which again reacts with more iron. This theory was controverted by Wyndham Dunstan, who attempted to prove that&nbsp;carbon dioxide was not necessary to rusting; and in place of&nbsp;the acid theory, he set up a scheme which involved the production of hydrogen peroxide. G. T. Moody has since shown that&nbsp;when all traces of carbon dioxide are removed (which is a matter&nbsp;of great experimental difficulty) iron may be left in contact&nbsp;with oxygen and water for long periods without rust appearing,&nbsp;but on the admission of carbon dioxide specks are rapidly&nbsp;formed. It also appears that rust changes in composition&nbsp;on exposure to the atmosphere, both the ferrous oxide and&nbsp;carbonate being in part oxidized to ferric oxide. Acids, other&nbsp;than carbonic, may promote rusting; this is particularly the&nbsp;case with ironwork exposed to the acids—sulphurous, nitric,&nbsp;&amp;c.—contained in smoke. It is probable that the action&nbsp;depends upon the presence of iron, oxygen and water, and some&nbsp;acid which makes the water an electrolyte.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Steel differs in many ways from iron in respect of atmospheric corrosion; the heterogeneous nature of steel gives occasion&nbsp;to a selective rusting, ferrite is much more readily attacked&nbsp;than the cementite and pearlite; moreover, the introduction&nbsp;of other elements may retard rusting; this is particularly the&nbsp;case with the nickel-steels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSTCHUK (Bulg. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Russe),</span><span class="font0"> the capital of the department of Rustchuk, Bulgaria, on the right bank of the Danube, where&nbsp;it receives the E. Lorn. Pop. (1906) 33,552. Rustchuk is the&nbsp;headquarters of a military division and of a naval flotilla&nbsp;stationed on the Danube. As a river-port and the terminus of&nbsp;railways from Varna and from Sofia via Tmovo, it has much&nbsp;commercial importance; and it possesses tobacco and cigarette factories, soap-works, breweries, aerated water factories,&nbsp;dyeworks, tanneries, sawmills, brick and tile works and a&nbsp;celebrated pottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the time of the Romans Rustchuk was one of the fortified points along the line of the Danube. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tabula Peutin-geriana</span><span class="font0"> it appears as Prisca, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antonine Itinerary</span><span class="font0"> as Seran-taprista, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font0"> as Seragintaprista and in Ptolemy as&nbsp;Priste Polis. Destroyed by barbarian invaders in the 7th&nbsp;century the town recovered its importance only in comparatively&nbsp;modern times. In 1810 it was captured by the Russians, who&nbsp;destroyed the fortifications. It played an important part in&nbsp;the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1828-29, 1853-54 and 1877-78. In&nbsp;1877 it was nearly destroyed by the Russian artillery stationed&nbsp;in the Rumanian town of Giurgevo, on the opposite bank of the&nbsp;Danube.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSTENBURG, a district and town of the Transvaal, South Africa. The district originally included all the N.W.&nbsp;part of the country, but is now of much smaller dimensions.&nbsp;Its S. border is marked by the Magaliesberg and other hills&nbsp;forming the N. escarpment of the high veld and the watershed&nbsp;between the Vaal and Limpopo. Several of the headstreams&nbsp;of the Limpopo rise within the district on the N. slopes of the&nbsp;Magaliesberg. The climate of the district is sub-tropical and&nbsp;the principal cultivation is that of tobacco, and fruit trees,&nbsp;notably oranges. The opening of the railway to Pretoria in&nbsp;1906 led to a marked development of trade. In an amphitheatre formed by the hills and 61 m. by rail W. of Pretoria is&nbsp;the town of Rustenburg with a population (1904) of 1815. The&nbsp;town is one of the oldest in the Transvaal, having been founded&nbsp;in 1850 by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Voortrekkcrs.</span><span class="font0"> It was at Rustenburg that the&nbsp;volksraad met in March 1852 to ratify the Sand River Convention granting independence to the Transvaal Boers. At the&nbsp;time it was feared that there would be civil war between Hendrik&nbsp;Potgieter and Andries Pretorius, but they were reconciled in&nbsp;Potgieteris tent. Later Rustenburg became the home of the&nbsp;Kruger family. It was occupied by the British under R. S.&nbsp;Baden Powell in June 1900.</span></p>
