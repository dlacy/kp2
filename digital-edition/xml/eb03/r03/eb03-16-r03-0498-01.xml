It has perhaps been ſo named by travelers who did not know that it was brought from Arabia Petræa. Roſe buſhes are frequently found in the fields about Jericho; but they are of a ſpecies much inferior to thoſe ſo much extolled in Scripture, the flowers of which ſome naturaliſts pretend to have in their cabinets.</p><p>“ The roſe ſhrub of Jericho (ſays Mariti) is a ſmall <hi rend="sup">,</hi> plant, with a buſhy root, about an inch and a half in' length. It has a number of Items which diverge from' the earth : they are covered with few leaves ; but it is loaded with flowers, which appear red when in bud, turn paler as they expand, and at length become white entirely. Theſe flowers appear to me to have a great reſemblaace to thoſe of the elder-tree ; with this difference, that they are entirely deſtitute of ſmell. The ſtems never riſe more than four or five inches from the ground. This ſhrub ſheds its leaves and its flowers as it withers. Its branches then bend in the middle, and becoming entwined with each other to the top, form a kind of globe. This happens during the great heats ; but during moiſt and rainy weather they again open and expand.</p><p>“ In this country of ignorance and ſuperſtſtſhn, people do not judge with a philoſophical eye of the alternate ſhutting and opening of this plant : it appears to them to be a periodical miracle, which heaven operates in order to make known the events of this world. The inhabitants of the neighbouring cantons come and examine theſe ſhrubs when they are about to undertake a journey, to form an alliance, to conclude any affair of importance, or on the birth of a ſon. If the ſtems of the plants are open, they do not doubt of fuc-ceſs ; but they account it a bad omen to ſee them ſhut, and therefore renounce their project if it be not too late.</p><p>“ This plant is neither ſubject to rot nor to wither. It will bear to be tranſplanted ; and thrives without degenerating in any kind of ſoil whatever.”</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Roses Otter</hi></hi> (or eſſential oil of), is obtained from roſes by ſimple diſtillation, and may be made in the following manner : A quantity of freſh roſes, for example 40 pounds, are put in a ſtill with 60 pounds of water, the roſes being left as they are with their calyxes, but with the ſtems cut cloſe. The maſs is then well mixed together with the hands, and a gentle fire is made under the ſtill ; when the water begins to grow hot, and fumes to riſe, the cap of the ſtill is put on, and the pipe fixed ; the chinks are then well luted with paſte, and cold water put on the refrigeratory at top ; the receiver is alſo adapted at thè end of the pipe ; and the fire is continued under the ſtill, neither too violent nor too weak. When the impregnated water begins to come over, aud the ſtill is very hot, the fire is leſſen-</p>

<p>ed by gentle degrees, and the diſtillation continued till 30 pounds of water are come over, which is generally done in about four or five hours ; this roſe-water is to be poured again on a freſſi quantity (40 pounds) of roſes, and from 15 to 20 pounds of water are to be drawn by diſtillation, following the ſame proceſs as before. The roſe-water thus made and cohobated will be found, if the roſes were good and freſh, and the diſtillation carefully performed, highly ſcented with the roſes. It is then poured into pans either of earthen ware or of tinned metal, and left expoſed to the freſh air for the night. The ottar or effence will be found in the morning congealed, and ſwimming on the top of the water ; this is to be carefully ſeparated and collected either with a thin ſhell or a ſkimmer, and poured into a vial. When a certain quantity has thus been obtained, the water and feces muſt be ſeparated from the clear effence, which, with reſpect to the firſt, will not be difficult to do, as the effence congeals with a flight cold, and the water may then be made to run off. If, after that, the effence is kept fluid by heat, the feces will ſubſide, and may be ſeparated ; but if the operation has been neatly performed, theſe will be little or rone. The feces are as highly perfumed as the effence, and muſt be kept, after as much of the effence has been ſkimmed from the roſe-water as could be. The remaining water ſhould be uſed for freſh diſtil-lations, inſtead of common water, at leaſt as far as it will go.</p><p>The above is the whole proceſs, as given in the Afia-tic Reſearches by lieutenant-colonel Polier ∙, of making genuine otter of roſes. But attempts (he ſays) are often made to augment the quantity, though at the ex-pence of the quality. Thus the raſpinga of ſandal-wood, which contain a deal of effential oil, are uſed ; but the impoſition is eaſily diſeovered, both by the ſinell, and becauſe the effential oil of ſandal-wood will not congeal in common cold. In other places they adulterate the otter by diſtiſting with the roſes a ſweet-ſcented graſs, which colours it of a high clear green. This does not congeal in a flight cold. There are numerous other modes, far more palpable, of adulteration. The quantity of effential oil to be obtained from roſes is very precarious, depending on the ſkill of the diſtil. 1er, on the quality of the roſes, and the favourableneſs of the ſeaſon. The colour of the otter is no criterion of its goodneſs, quality, or country The calyxes by no means diminiſh the quality of otter, nor do they impart any green colour to it. They indeed augment the quantity, but the trouble neccffary to ſtrip them is ſuch as to prevent their being often uſed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ross,-Nobιe,</hi> an ancient Engliſh gold coin, firſt ftruck in the reign of Edward III.
