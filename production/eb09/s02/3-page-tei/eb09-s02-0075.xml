Though weak in paintings of Giotto and his school, it possesses many early Sienese pictures of great interest and exceptional importance (see fig. 1), and a collection unrivalled out of Italy of the works of the best Florentine painters of the 15th century, as Paolo Uccello, Lippo Lippi, Pollaiuolo, Signorelli, Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, and others (see fig. 6). Of the very few existing easel pictures by Pisanello @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> the National Gallery contains one (signed), St George and St Anthony. The portrait by Andrea del Sarto is one of his finest works,—full of life and expression and rich in tone. In addition to a large painting on canvas of the school of Michelangelo—Leda and the Swan @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>—the National Gallery possesses two unfinished pictures, a Madonna and Angels and an Entombment of Christ, both of which, in spite of many adverse criticisms, appear to be genuine works of Michelangelo, the former in his early, the latter in his later manner—a very remarkable possession for one gallery, seeing that the only other genuine easel painting by him is the circular panel of the Madonna in the tribune of the Uffizi (Florence). No four pictures could better represent Raphael’s highly varied manners than the miniature Knight’s Dream, the Ansidei Madonna, the St Catherine, and the Garvagh Madonna, which in the dates of their execution</p><p>cover nearly the whole of his short working life. In the Venetian school the National Gallery is almost unrivalled : it contains a large number of fine examples of Crivelli (see fig. 14),—Venice not possessing one ; two rare panels by Marziale, both signed and dated (1500 and 1507); the finest specimens of Giovanni Bellini (see fig. 15) and his school which exist out of Venice ; one of Titian’s noblest works,—the Ariadne and Bacchus, finished in 1523 for the duke of Ferrara, together with two other fine pictures of earlier date ; and the masterpiece of Sebastiano del Piombo, his Raising of Lazarus, partly designed by Michelangelo. The smaller schools of Ferrara and Cremona are well represented by examples of nearly all their chief painters. Of the Umbrian school the gallery possesses two or rather three important, though much injured, panels by Piero della Francesca (see fig. 10), a fine picture by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, as well as one of Perugino’s best works, the triptych from the Certosa near Pavia (see fig. 12), and other paintings by him. Correggio is represented by three fine pictures, classical and religious, specimens of unusual excellence (see fig. 21). Of the Bolognese school there are three works by Francia, one signed (see fig. 19), and specimens of the painters of the later school,— Annibale Caracci, Guido (see fig. 20), and others. Paul Veronese’s Dream of St Helena and the group of portraits of the Pisani family, arranged as the scene of the family of Darius before Alexander, are among his finest works. The three pictures by Lotto are excellent examples of his supreme talents in portraiture ; and no collection outside Brescia and Bergamo is so rich in the noble portrait pictures of Moretto and his pupil Moroni. Leonardo da Vinci (the rarest of the great masters) is represented by a very beautiful picture @@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> which appears to have been partly finished by</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi>	Some small panels attributed to Pisanello in Rome and elsewhere are of very doubtful genuineness.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@2</hi>	Not exhibited ; it is probably a pupil’s copy of the marble group of the same subject designed by Michelangelo.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@3</hi> In addition to the strong internal evidence in favour of this picture being at least in part a genuine work of Da Vinci, it is expressly mentioned as being by him in the <hi rend="italic">Trattatο della Pittura</hi> (ii. 17 and iv. 1), written by the Milanese Lomazzo before 1584. The painting was then in the church of 8. Francesco at Milan, where it remained till 1796.</p></body></text></TEI>
