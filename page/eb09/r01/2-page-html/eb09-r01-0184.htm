The purchase&nbsp;of a reversionary interest might formerly have been set aside in a&nbsp;court of equity on the ground of inadequacy of price. This rule of&nbsp;equity no longer exists. It was enacted by 31 Viet. c. 4 (which&nbsp;extends to the United Kingdom) that no purchase made </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bona fide&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of a reversionary interest in real or personal estate shall be set&nbsp;aside merely on the ground of under-value. The Act does not&nbsp;affect those cases in which the courts relieve against such purchases&nbsp;on the ground of fraud or duress—the cases, for instance, of exorbitant bargains made by money-lenders with expectant heirs. In&nbsp;Scotland reversion is generally used in a sense approaching that&nbsp;of the equity of redemption of English law. A reversion is either&nbsp;legal, as in an adjudication, or conventional, as in a wadset.&nbsp;Reversions are registered under the system established by the Act&nbsp;1617 c. 16 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Registration).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REMBRANDT (1607-1669). </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rembrandt Harmens van Rijn, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tlie chief of the Dutch school of painting&nbsp;and one of the greatest painters the world has seen, was&nbsp;born in Leyden on the 15th July 1607.@@<sup>1</sup> It is only&nbsp;within the past thirty years that we have come to know&nbsp;anything of the real history of the man. Up to that&nbsp;time we had but a tissue of fables connected with his&nbsp;name and representing him as ignorant, boorish, and&nbsp;avaricious. These fictions, resting on the loose assertions&nbsp;of Houbraken </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(JDe Groote Schouburgh,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1718), have been&nbsp;cleared away by the untiring researches of Scheltema&nbsp;and other Dutchmen, notably by C. Vosmaer, whose&nbsp;elaborate work (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rembrandt</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">set Vie et ses (Euvres</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, 1868,&nbsp;2d ed. 1877) will remain as the basis of our knowledge&nbsp;of the man and of the chronological development of the&nbsp;artist.@@<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rembrandt’s high position in European art</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">rests on the originality of his mind, the power of his imagination, his profound sympathy with his subjects,&nbsp;the boldness of his system of light and shade, the thoroughness of his modelling, his subtle colour, and above all on&nbsp;the intense humanity of the man. He was great in conception and in execution, a poet as well as a painter,&nbsp;an idealist and also a realist; and this rare union is the&nbsp;secret of his power. From his dramatic action and&nbsp;mastery of expression Rembrandt has been well called&nbsp;“ the Shakespeare of Holland.” To understand aright&nbsp;his position in art, we must consider rapidly his surroundings and note the influences which affected him; we&nbsp;shall thus find what he had in common with his time and&nbsp;understand better how far he was really a new power, an&nbsp;original genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It must be borne in mind that in the beginning of the 17tli century Holland had risen to great power. Though&nbsp;not yet formally free from the Spanish yoke, she had broken&nbsp;the fetters by the heroic efforts of the former generation, and&nbsp;had entered on her grand career of national enterprise.&nbsp;Science and literature flourished in her universities, poetry&nbsp;and the stage were favoured by her citizens, and art found&nbsp;a home not only in the capital but in the provincial towns.&nbsp;It was a time also of new ideas. Old conventional forms&nbsp;in religion, philosophy, and art had fallen away, and liberty&nbsp;was inspiring new conceptions. It is with those of art&nbsp;that we have to deal. Here there were no church&nbsp;influences at work to fetter the painter in the choice and&nbsp;treatment of his subject, no academies to prescribe rules.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Left to himself, therefore, the artist painted the life of the people among whom he lived and the subjects which&nbsp;interested them. It was thus a living history that he&nbsp;painted,—scenes from the everyday life and amusements&nbsp;of the people, often mean and vulgar it must be confessed,&nbsp;the civic rulers, the regents of the hospitals and the heads&nbsp;of the guilds, and the civic guards who defended their&nbsp;towns. So also with the religious pictures which were&nbsp;produced under the influence of these environments. The&nbsp;dogmas and legends of the Church of Rome were no longer&nbsp;of interest to such a nation ; but the Bible was read and&nbsp;studied with avidity, and from its page the artist drew&nbsp;directly the scenes of the simple narrative. The Old and&nbsp;New Testaments and the Apocrypha were the sources from&nbsp;which, without any interference of Jesuit inquisitors, he&nbsp;drew his inspiration. This change had been coming on&nbsp;steadily since the Reformation, a change that implied a&nbsp;growing freedom from trammels and a larger and more&nbsp;human view of the subjects treated. Perhaps the earliest&nbsp;trace of this new aspect of Bible story is to be found in the&nbsp;pictures painted in Rome about the beginning of the 17 th&nbsp;century by Adam Elsheimer of Frankfort, who had&nbsp;undoubtedly a great influence on the Dutch painters&nbsp;studying in Italy. These in their turn carried back to&nbsp;Holland the simplicity and the picturesque effect which they&nbsp;found in Elsheimer’s work. Among these, the precursors&nbsp;of Rembrandt, may be mentioned Moeyaert, Ravesteyn,&nbsp;Lastman, Pinas, Honthorst, and Bramer. Influenced doubtless by these painters, Rembrandt determined to work out&nbsp;his own ideas of art on Dutch soil, resisting apparently&nbsp;every inducement to visit Italy. Though an admirer of&nbsp;the great Italian masters, he yet maintained his own&nbsp;individuality in the most marked manner. It is strange&nbsp;that we have no evidence that he ever met his greatest&nbsp;Dutch rival, the brillant Frans Hals, his senior by some&nbsp;fifteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rembrandt was born in the house No. 3 Weddesteg, on the rampart at Leyden overlooking the Rhine. The&nbsp;house belonged to his father Gerrit Harmen van Rijn, a&nbsp;well-to-do miller, and still exists, but the windmill is no&nbsp;more. He was the fourth son, and, as the older boys had&nbsp;been sent to trade, his parents resolved that he should&nbsp;enter a learned profession. With this view he was sent&nbsp;to the High School at Leyden; but the boy soon manifested his dislike of the prospect and determined to be a&nbsp;painter. Accordingly he was placed for three years under&nbsp;Swanenburch, a connexion of the Van Rijn family.&nbsp;This master was a painter of no great merit, but he&nbsp;enjoyed some reputation from his having studied in Italy.&nbsp;His next master was Lastman of Amsterdam, a painter of&nbsp;very considerable power. In Lastman’s works we can&nbsp;trace the germs of the colour and sentiment of his greater&nbsp;pupil, though his direct influence cannot have been great,&nbsp;as it is said by Orlers that Rembrandt remained with him&nbsp;only six months, after which time he returned to Leyden,&nbsp;about 1623. During the early years of his life at Leyden&nbsp;Rembrandt seems to have devoted himself entirely to&nbsp;studies, painting and etching the people around him, the&nbsp;beggars and cripples, every picturesque face and form he&nbsp;could get hold of. Life, character, and above all light&nbsp;were the aims of these studies. His mother was a frequent model, and we can trace in her features the strong&nbsp;likeness to her son, especially in the portraits of himself&nbsp;at an advanced age. So far as we know there is no&nbsp;likeness of his father, who died about 1632. The last&nbsp;portrait of his mother is that of the Belvidere Gallery of&nbsp;Vienna, painted the year before her death in 1640. One&nbsp;of his sisters also frequently sat to him, and Bode suggests&nbsp;that she must have accompanied him to Amsterdam and&nbsp;kept house for him till he married. This conjecture rests</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is now generally accepted as the year of his birth, though&nbsp;some hold it should be 1606 or 1608.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vosmaer’s first volume, on the precursors and apprenticeship of&nbsp;Rembrandt, was published in 1863. New light has since been thrown&nbsp;on important points by Dr Bode </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Holländische Malerei,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1883), De&nbsp;Roever, De Vries, and others.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
