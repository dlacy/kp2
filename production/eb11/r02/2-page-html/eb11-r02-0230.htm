<p><span class="font0">a feeling of discontent at the company’s conduct of affairs. The company was willing on proper terms to hand over&nbsp;the administration to the colonists, and they secured the&nbsp;services of Sir George Goldie to examine the situation&nbsp;and report on what terms the transfer could be made. Sir&nbsp;George visited Rhodesia in 1903-4, and drew up a scheme&nbsp;which included the taking over by Rhodesia of the administrative liabilities incurred by the company, which would thus&nbsp;become a public debt. After consultation between leading&nbsp;Rhodesians and the directors of the company the scheme was&nbsp;abandoned, the Rhodesians considering the financial burden&nbsp;proposed too great for an infant colony. The company therefore&nbsp;continued the administration, devoting attention to the development of agriculture and mining. The two railway systems&nbsp;were linked together by a line from Bulawayo to Salisbury,&nbsp;and several short lines to mining properties were built. From&nbsp;Bulawayo the main line was continued to the Wankie coalfields, thence to the Zambezi, bridged in 1905 just below the&nbsp;Victoria Falls. From the Zambezi the line went north-east,&nbsp;so as to render accessible the mineral wealth of Barotse-Iand and that of Katanga on the Rhodesian-Congo frontier.&nbsp;Although Rhodesia was affected by the commercial depression&nbsp;which prevailed in South Africa for some years after the close&nbsp;of the war, its industries showed considerable vitality. In&nbsp;1906 the gold output exceeded 500,000 oz., and in the financial&nbsp;year 1905-6 the revenue of Southern Rhodesia slightly exceeded the expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Only once (1895-96) in the first fifteen years following the settlement of the country had the company’s annual revenue&nbsp;exceeded the amount expended in the same period. As a&nbsp;commercial undertaking, the company therefore was during&nbsp;this period of no pecuniary advantage to the shareholders.&nbsp;This was due in part to unforeseen and unavoidable causes,&nbsp;but it is also true that the founders of the company had other&nbsp;than commercial aims. Rhodes’s chief ambition was to secure&nbsp;the country for Britain and to open it up to the energies of&nbsp;her peoples, and he succeeded in this aim. He acted more&nbsp;quickly, and in<sub>;</sub> many ways more effectively, than the imperial&nbsp;government would have been able to act had it at the outset&nbsp;taken over the country. To the sturdy colonists Rhodes&nbsp;made available a land rich not only in gold, but in coal and&nbsp;other minerals, and with very great agricultural and pastoral&nbsp;resources, and all this was done without the cost of a penny&nbsp;to the imperial exchequer, Despite all drawbacks, an area&nbsp;(reckoning Southern Rhodesia only) considerably larger than&nbsp;that of the United Kingdom had in less than twenty years&nbsp;been endowed with all the adjuncts of civilization and made&nbsp;the home of thousands of settlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The progress made by the country in the five years 1906-10 demonstrated that the faith Rhodes and his colleagues had&nbsp;placed in it was not ill-founded. Although the white population increased but slowly, in all other respects healthy&nbsp;development took place, the element of speculation which&nbsp;had characterized many of the first attempts to exploit the&nbsp;land being largely eliminated. In 1906 Lord SeIborne (the&nbsp;high commissioner) visited Rhodesia. He inquired into the&nbsp;various grievances of the settlers against the Chartered Company; held an indaba with Matabele indunas in the Matoppo&nbsp;Hills, and at Bulawayo had a conference with Lewanika, the&nbsp;paramount chief of the Barotse. In 1907 Dr Jameson and&nbsp;other directors of the Chartered Company travelled through&nbsp;Rhodesia, and the result was to clear up some of the matters&nbsp;in dispute between the settlers and the company. Southern&nbsp;Rhodesia had become self-supporting, and the essentially&nbsp;temporary nature of the existing system of government was&nbsp;recognized. But the company held that the time was not yet&nbsp;ripe for Southern Rhodesia to become a self-governing colony.&nbsp;The directors, however, adopted a more liberal land policy,&nbsp;the increased attention given to agriculture being a marked&nbsp;and satisfactory feature of the situation. Mining and railway&nbsp;development were also pushed on vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The movement for the closer union of the British'South</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">African colonies excited lively interest in Southern Rhodesia. The territory, not possessing self-government, could not take&nbsp;part in the national convention which met at Durban in&nbsp;October 1908 on equal terms with the delegates of the Cape,&nbsp;&amp;c. It was, however, represented by three delegates on the&nbsp;understanding that Rhodesia would not, for the time being at&nbsp;least, be included in. any agreement which might be reached.&nbsp;The convention resulted in the union (on the 31st of May 1910)&nbsp;under one government of the Cape, Transvaal, Natal and&nbsp;Orange River colonies. The position of Rhodesia with respect&nbsp;to the Union </span><span class="font2">was </span><span class="font0">set forth in the South Africa Act 1909. It&nbsp;provides that “ the king, with the advice of the Privy Council,&nbsp;may on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the Union&nbsp;admit into the Union the territories administered by the&nbsp;British South Africa Company on such terms and conditions&nbsp;as to representation and otherwise in each case as are expressed in the addresses and approved by the king.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Rhodesia itself at this time there was a widespread feeling that there was no urgency as to the territory joining the Union,&nbsp;and the opinion was held by many that a separate existence&nbsp;as a self-governing community would be preferable. A section&nbsp;of the settlers were content for the present to remain under&nbsp;the government of the Chartered Company.</span></p>
