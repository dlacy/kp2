important discussions^on the American war. The former of these themes, in which Chatham stood forth as the champion of the people against the supposed usurpation of the House of Commons, drew from him some of his most electric flashes of passion and imagery. One is the speech in 1770, on the Marquis of Rockingham’s motion for an inquiry into the state of the nation ; in which occurs the splendid passage beginning with the bold prayer for the prevalence of discord, if freedom could not otherwise be preserved, thence passing to the parallel between the scriptural records and the charters of the English constitution, and ending with the stern allusion to the value which the Revolution of 1688 possessed as a warning to succeeding British monarchs. But it is to the American question that we owe his finest speeches ; and on this subject we have a series of harangues, exhibiting in admirable union the intellectual, the imaginative, and the passionate elements of oratory, and invaluable to the student, both for their high rank in these points of excellence, for the pointed nervousness of the style, and for the singular force and nature of the rhetorical figures,—indignant interrogation, sudden self-correction, and anxious and solemn repetition. The finest of all is undoubtedly the speech on the address to the throne in November 1777. But. no parliamentary speech whatever is more interesting, or more honourable to the speaker, than the extemporaneous address elicited from the old man in the same year, by the ministerial defence of the employment of the Indians in America. In the imperfectly reported speech wlâch he delivered on that memorable evening, his last in public life, when he fell down in convulsions, on rising to reply to the attacks of the Duke of Richmond, he related the whole history of the war with America ; he repeated the predictions which he had himself day after day pronounced as warnings to the state ; and, like a dying prophet reproaching an unbelieving generation, he followed his recital of every prediction by the words, “ And so it proved 1”
Burke’s speeches and political pamphlets compose by far the most valuable body of lessons in eloquence w hich our language possesses. They instruct us sometimes by those failures into which the orator was betrayed by his teeming, imaginative, and exciteable genius ; but they teach us at least as often by examples of the most signal and splendid success. As Burke, more than any other of our statesmen, nourished the ambition of rivalling ancient eloquence, so his works, in the variety of their oratorical qualities, and in the finish which they frequently exhibit, do unquestionably come nearer than any others to the ancient character. They are, it is true, in their prevailing manner, more like to the ornate and redundant elocution of Cicero, than to the severe simplicity of the great Athenian ; but some of their happiest images and thoughts are derived from Demosthenes, and some equally happy are not unworthy of him. Burke’s style, while it is highly argumentative, is distinguished, beyond that of any other political writer or speaker, for the continual distrust which it exhibits in the hearers’ ability or willingness to follow trains of pure argument : the imagination is constantly excited by illustration and imagery : and, to use our rhetorical terminology, the favourite argument is the example, instances real and fictitious being crowded upon each other, as if the speaker were resolutely determined to appropriate one to every individual who listened to him ; and the argument being at length usually closed by a strongly worded aphorism, sometimes true and as often erroneous, very seldom logically proved by the arguments which have preceded it, but always strikingly illustrated by them, and exhibited in the most conciliating and attractive light. Perhaps Burke’s oratorical skill and genius are not anywhere displayed so remarkably as in his Reflections on the Revolution of France, in which the writer, besides the prejudice to which he exposed himself by his sudden change of party, had another and stronger disadvantage
in 
his own mind; namely, that of defending and representing as paramount a series of principles in politics and legislation, which, if he had not substantively denied their truth, he had at least, in common with his party, always represented as subordinate to other principles which it was now his task to decry. But the man of genius did not shrink from the undertaking, and the powers of his remarkable mind bore him triumphantly through it ; for no discourse could have been more skilfully conducted, or better calculated to make a strong impression. He even labours again and again to enlist in his new cause those feelings in favour of constitutional freedom, which he had so long been accustomed to rally round him ; but he rests his hopes of success mainly on the excitement of other ideas and feelings, which he paints to the fancy in colours as bright as any in which his pencil was ever dipped. The horror of bloodshed, attachment to order, and fear of anarchy, now hold in the writer’s mind that prevailing place which had formerly belonged to the hatred of despotism and the love of freedom : the sentiment of chivalrous devotion to kings and ladies is aroused by that beautifully and pathetically romantic picture of the Queen of France as the morning star : the departure of the ancient days of knightly strength and honour is seriously and warmly deplored ; their very vices, it is declared, have given place to others worse, and their religious superstition is boldly preferred to the philosophical superstition of the modern sceptics. Among Burke’s speeches, the masterpieces are admittedly those on the impeachment of Warren Hastings, which compose a field too wide to be here surveyed. Of the minor speeches there is scarcely one that is not both characteristic and highly instructive. None of them possesses greater variety than the speech of 1775 for Conciliation with America ; the beauties of which it is not easy to select :—the vision of the guardian angel, who, drawing aside a curtain, displays the glories of Britain in sunshine, darkened but by one faint and distant spot (an image which, like many others of the same speaker, hovers on the very verge of poetry, and can scarcely have been successful in the House of Commons) ; the picturesque description of the kingdom of the backwoodsmen ; tlle animated appeals to English freedom and free habits, like that in which he tells his hearers, that if they preach unconstitutional doctrines to the Americans, their English speech will betray them ; the bold figures by which he introduces the resolutions which he was to move ; and the classical image of the temple of peace, with which the oration closes. The speech of 1780, on Economical Reform, is at once manly, practical, and well reasoned, and full of the most happily-conceived ridicule. The celebrated speech at Bristol, and that on Fox’s East India Bill, although possessing high oratorical merit, and abounding with fine passages, are yet less valuable to the student than to the politician. The speech on the Nabob of Arcot, s Debts exhibits Burke at once in his full strength, and with much of his weakness ; it is full of pertinent inferences from granted facts ; rich in picturesque oriental imagery ; and adorned by a profusion of oratorical figures, varying in character and success from the grand image of Hyder Ali and the cloud (after Demosthenes), down to the familiar one which represents the minister as sowing corruption broadcast, and the disgusting one in which one of the orator’s most disliked adversaries is compared to the most unclean of animals.
Of Canning we mean to say very little, besides recommending his speeches to the student as exceedingly instruc-l tive lessons. They are in the hands, and familiar to the 1  recollection, of every one ; and no estimate of their merits could be complete which should not analyse, by way of comparison, tlle oratory of one or more of his rivals who have not yet quitted the scene. In Canning’s speeches, the
