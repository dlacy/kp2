<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lollards in England and the Hussites in Bohemia, may be looked upon as the ancestors in faith of the Huguenots&nbsp;and the Puritans of after-times, and were all more or less&nbsp;characterized by an aversion to the Roman ritual, to&nbsp;splendid churches, to crosses and crucifixes, combined&nbsp;with a more definite denial of such doctrines as that of&nbsp;baptismal regeneration, of transubstantiation, of masses&nbsp;for the dead, and of the obligation to observe Lent. The&nbsp;ultimate fate of these different sects was singularly similar.&nbsp;Of their earlier history, indeed, we have but few memorials, for their records, if any existed, have mostly perished;&nbsp;and, as with their prototypes in the earlier Christian&nbsp;centuries, it became almost necessarily their policy to&nbsp;avoid all external demonstrations which would be likely&nbsp;to arrest the attention of the world. An inquisitor of&nbsp;the 13th century, when describing the Leonists (c. 1250),&nbsp;whom he speaks of as both the most ancient and the&nbsp;most widely spread of the sects then existing, represents&nbsp;them as by no means guilty, to all external appearance, of&nbsp;practices which could fairly be stigmatized as blasphemous,&nbsp;but as wearing a great semblance of piety, as being of good&nbsp;repute among their neighbours, and chiefly blamable as&nbsp;given to speaking against the Roman Church and its&nbsp;clergy and thus gaining, only too easily, the ears of the&nbsp;laity at large.@@<sup>1</sup> To such characteristics, however, the Albi-genses in the 12th century had presented a remarkable&nbsp;exception. At the commencement of the pontificate of&nbsp;Innocent III. (1198) his legates had found nearly the&nbsp;whole of the rich and prosperous territory extending from&nbsp;Carcassonne to Bordeaux dominated by this powerful&nbsp;heresy,—a form of doctrine associated, moreover, not with&nbsp;austerity but with voluptuousness of life, with a profound&nbsp;contempt for the priestly profession, and with a warm&nbsp;admiration for the conceptions of chivalry and the poetry&nbsp;of the troubadour,—a heresy enriched by the devotion of&nbsp;its adherents to an extent which made it far wealthier&nbsp;than the church itself in those regions, and before which&nbsp;the representatives of the Roman orthodoxy seemed&nbsp;threatened almost with extinction. The suppression of&nbsp;this heresy by Simon de Montfort is a well-known episode,&nbsp;and would seem to have formed the point of departure&nbsp;for a new and more rigorous policy on the part of the&nbsp;church in its dealings Avith like manifestations of disobedience. In the year 1229 the statutes of the council&nbsp;of Toulouse formulated, as it were, the code of persecution,&nbsp;and, aided by the Inquisition, which probably took its rise&nbsp;about the same time, supplied a new machinery for the&nbsp;detection and suppression of heresy. To the terrorism&nbsp;thus established, after the sword of De Montfort had done&nbsp;its work, we may fairly refer the changed characteristics&nbsp;of the adherents of the heresies in France, as above described, in the middle of the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">! But, the suspicions of the church having once been thoroughly roused and the secular power incited and&nbsp;guided to its task, external conformity and inoffensive life,&nbsp;the mountain hamlet and the secluded valley, proved alike&nbsp;unavailing to avert the cruelty of the persecutor. The&nbsp;Cathari in Italy did not long survive the fall of the Holien-staufens, from whom they had received effective protection&nbsp;and support; and it added not a little to the offence of&nbsp;the doctrines proclaimed by the Spiritual Franciscans,&nbsp;whose tenets were condemned by the council of Vienne&nbsp;in 1311, that, while the order had taken its rise in a spirit&nbsp;of protest against the corruptions of the Curia, its members&nbsp;were known to be ready to favour and aid by all the&nbsp;means in their power the restoration of the imperial&nbsp;ascendency in Italy. The Spiritual Franciscans were the&nbsp;forerunners of the Apostolic Brethren, one of the most&nbsp;widely spread of the new sects, and must also be looked</span></p>
<p></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">upon as the precursors of the Lollards. The intimate connexion between theological doctrine and political opinion that existed among the latter sect is Avell known. We&nbsp;find, accordingly, that heresy, long before Reformation&nbsp;times, was regarded by the papal power as associated with&nbsp;hostile political interests, and that a new incentive to its&nbsp;rigorous suppression was thus supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">On the other hand, the popedom itself, during the long sojourn of the pontiffs at Avignon (1309-78), became&nbsp;involved in a political alliance, whereby it alienated&nbsp;the sympathies of Europe at large to an extent which it&nbsp;was never afterwards able to regain. During that long&nbsp;and humiliating episode in its history the office was filled&nbsp;almost exclusively by Frenchmen, whose policy was conceived in complete subservience to that of the reigning&nbsp;French monarch; and the pontiff at Avignon thus came&nbsp;to be regarded both by the empire and in England as&nbsp;the pliant ally of a hostile pqwer. During the following&nbsp;century it recovered much of its influence in Germany,&nbsp;where its pretensions were sometimes regarded not unfavourably by the electors as an equipoise to the too&nbsp;despotic sway of the emperor. Somewhat later we find&nbsp;it receiving the most efficient support from Spain. But&nbsp;it could never again command the same universal deference in Western Christendom; and the apparently genuine&nbsp;devotion to its interests which may from time to time be&nbsp;discerned manifesting itself, now in one nation and now&nbsp;in another, was largely inspired by political considerations,&nbsp;and often dearly purchased at the expense of a corresponding hostility provoked among another people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">To the manner in which theological tenets, often purely speculative in their origin and innocuous in their bearing&nbsp;upon practice, thus came to be regarded as identified&nbsp;with secular questions of grave import and pressing for an&nbsp;immediate solution, we must partly attribute the jealousy&nbsp;with which the first symptoms of heresy were now watched&nbsp;for by Rome. Early in the 14th century the Fraticelli&nbsp;and the Apostolic Brethren, with other heretical sects,&nbsp;were anathematized. In the year 1324 Pope John XXII.&nbsp;demanded of the emperor the suppression of the Waldenses,@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>who had reappeared in Lombardy; and, ably as Marsilius&nbsp;of Padua assailed the pretensions of the papacy, his protest seemed ineffectual amid the supreme humiliation of&nbsp;his patron, Louis of Bavaria. Driven alike from Italy&nbsp;and from France, the persecuted sect took refuge in Savoy&nbsp;and in Switzerland, and in the year 1489 the papal legate&nbsp;reported that their numbers were not less than 50,000.&nbsp;Lollardism was suppressed with unsparing hand in England;&nbsp;and John Sawtrey, the first of Wikliffe’s followers to suffer&nbsp;martyrdom, was burnt to death in 1401, for refusing to&nbsp;worship the cross and for denial of the doctrine of&nbsp;transubstantiation. Fifteen years later John Huss and&nbsp;Jerome of Prague suffered the same fate at Constance, and&nbsp;the indignation excited among their fellow-countrymen,&nbsp;intensified as this feeling was by differences of race, gave&nbsp;rise to a memorable resistance, which eventually won&nbsp;religious freedom for the land. At the diet of Kutna&nbsp;Hora (Kuttenberg) in 1485 a truce was made between&nbsp;the Utraquists and the Catholics for thirty-two years, and&nbsp;the complete religious equality then established was made&nbsp;permanent at the diet of 1512. In England, on the&nbsp;other hand, the Lollard movement was almost completely&nbsp;extinguished. The political doctrines with which it had&nbsp;become associated made it the object of suspicion alike&nbsp;to the ecclesiastical and to the civil power ; and Sir John</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
