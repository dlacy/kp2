He had the satisfaction to see it translated into all the languages of Europe ; to bear his opinions quoted in the House of Commons ; to be consulted by the minister; and to observe that the principles which he had expounded were beginning to produce a material change in the public opinion, and in the councils of this and other countries ; and he must have enjoyed the full conviction that the progress of events would ensure their ultimate triumph, by showing that they were productive of signal advantage, not only to the general mass of mankind, but to the inhabitants of every country which should have good sense enough to adopt them.</p><p>Mr. Hume died very soon after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations.</hi> Dr. Smith, with whom he had long lived on the most intimate terms, was most assiduous in his attentions to his illustrious friend during his illness ; and he gave <hi rend="italic">a</hi> brief account of the circumstances connected with his death, together with a sketch of his character, in a letter addressed to Mr. Strahan of London, which was soon after published as a supplement to Mr. Hume’s autobiography. The unqualified eulogium pronounced in this letter on Mr. Hume’s character excited the indignation of those who took offence at his religious opinions. Dr. Horne, bishop of Norwich, in an anonymous letter, attacked Dr. Smith on this ground ; and very naturally ascribed to him the same sceptical opinions that had been entertained by his deceased friend. But he took no notice of this attack ; and wisely declined entering upon a controversy that could have led to no useful result.</p><p>Dr. Smith resided principally in London during the two years immediately subsequent to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations ;</hi> caressed by the most distinguished persons in the metropolis, who were justly proud of his acquaintance, and who, though they could not always subscribe to the justice of his remarks, were equally delighted with the goodness of his heart, the simplicity of his manners, the vigour of his understanding, and the variety of his attainments. In 1788 he was appointed, through the unsolicited application of his old pupil and friend, the Duke of Buccleugh, a commissioner of customs for Scotland. In consequence of this appointment he removed to Edinburgh, where he continued afterwards to reside, possessed of an income more than equal to his wants, and in the enjoyment of the society of his earliest and most esteemed friends. His mother, then in extreme old age, and his cousin, Miss Douglas, accompanied him to Edinburgh, the latter superintending the domestic arrangements and economy of his family. But though his appointment to the customs reflects high credit on the nobleman by whose intervention it was procured, it may be doubted whether it was worthy of the country or of Dr. Smith. The philosopher who had produced a work in which the true sources of national wealth and prosperity were, for the first time, fully explored and laid open, deserved a different and a higher reward.</p><p>In 1787 Dr. Smith was elected Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow ; on which occasion he addressed a letter to that learned body, which strikingly evinces the high sense be felt of this honour, and his affectionate regard for those from which it emanated. “ No preferment,” says he, “could have given me so much real satisfaction. No man can owe greater obligations to a society than I do to the University of Glasgow. They educated me ; they sent me to Oxford. Soon after my return to Scotland, they elected</p><p>me one of their own members ; and afterwards preferred me to another office, to which the abilities and virtues of the never to be forgotten Dr. Hutcheson had given a superior degree of illustration. The period of thirteen years, which I spent as a member of that society, I remember as by far the most useful, and therefore as by far the happiest and most honourable, period of my life ; and now, after three and twenty years’ absence, to be remembered in so very agreeable a manner by my old friends and protectors, gives me a heartfelt joy which I cannot easily express to yap.”</p><p>His constitution, which had at no time been robust, began early to give way ; and his decline was accelerated by the grief and vexation he felt on account of the death of his mother, to whom he had been most tenderly attached, in 1784, and of Miss Douglas, in 1788. He survived the latter only about two years, having died in July 1790. His last illness, which was occasioned by a chronic obstruction of the bowels, was both tedious and painful : but he bore it with the greatest fortitude and resignation : his cheerfulness never forsook him ; and he had all the consolation that could be derived from the affectionate sympathy and attention of his friends.</p><p>His conduct in private life did not belie the generous principles inculcated in his works. He was in the habit pf allotting a considerable part of his income to offices of secret charity. Mr. Stewart mentions that he had been made acquainted with some very affecting instances of his beneficence. “ They were all,” he observes, “ on a scale much beyond what might have been expected from his fortune ; and were accompanied with circumstances equally honourable to the delicacy of his feelings and the liberality of his heart.”</p><p>Dr. Smith collected an exceedingly valuable and well- selected, though not a very extensive, library. He was very particular, not only with respect to the books themselves, but also with respect to the condition of the copies admitted into his collection. “ The first time,” says Mr- Smellie, “ I happened to be in his library, observing me looking at the books with some degree of curiosity and perhaps surprise, for most of the volumes were elegantly and some of them superbly bound, 'You must have remarked,’ said he, ‘ that <hi rend="italic">I am a beau in nothing but my books.’”@@* </hi>His library is still in the possession of Lord Reston’s widow.</p><p>Notwithstanding the apparent flow and artlessness of his style, and his great experience in composition, Dr. Smith stated, not long before his death, that he continued to compose as slowly, and with as great difficulty, as at first. He did not write with his own hand, but generally walked up and down his apartment, dictating to an amanuensis.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p><p>Dr. Smith had been long resolved that none of his manuscripts, except those which he himself judged fit for publication, should ever see the light ; and a few days before his death he carried this resolution into effect, by having all his papers committed to the flames, with the exception of the fragments of some essays, intended to illustrate the principles that lead and direct philosophical inquiries, which he left to the discretion of his friends to publish or not as they thought proper. The contents of the manuscripts that were destroyed are not exactly known; but they certainly contained the course of lectures on rhetoric delivered at Edinburgh in 1748, and the lectures on jurisprudence and natural religion, which formed a most important part of the course of moral philosophy delivered at Glasgow. The loss of the latter must ever be a subject of deep regret.
