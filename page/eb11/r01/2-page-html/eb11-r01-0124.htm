<p><span class="font0">RANELAGH, formerly a popular resort by the Thames in Chelsea, London, England. About 1690 the land lying east&nbsp;of Chelsea Hospital, and bordering the river about the point&nbsp;where Chelsea Bridge now stands, was acquired by Richard,&nbsp;Viscount Ranelagh, later earl of Ranelagh (d. 1711). He&nbsp;built a mansion and laid out fine gardens, which, in 1742,&nbsp;were thrown open as a proprietary place of entertainment.&nbsp;A building called the Rotunda was erected for concerts, and&nbsp;the gardens quickly became a favourite resort of fashionable&nbsp;society. Balls and masquerades, exhibitions of fireworks,&nbsp;regattas and many other forms of amusement were provided;&nbsp;but by the close of the 18th century Ranelagh was ceasing to&nbsp;attract the public, and in 1803 the Rotunda was closed. The&nbsp;buildings were removed, and the grounds became the property&nbsp;of Chelsea Hospital. They are still included in the pleasant&nbsp;gardens belonging to that foundation, but no traces of the&nbsp;popular Ranelagh are preserved. There is, however, a&nbsp;fashionable modern club of the same name.</span></p>

Usually it is a right-angled triangle, the length of the base of which is known, and&nbsp;one of the sides is the range it is desired to find. They are,&nbsp;in fact, goniometers, but the angle which they measure, whether&nbsp;it may be at the end of the measured base, or that subtended&nbsp;by it, is usually expressed as a function of the angle in terms&nbsp;of the measured base. Thus the range is recorded directly&nbsp;in metres or yards without calculation. It is proposed here</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">to describe principally the range-finding instruments in the British services (1) as used in the fleet; (2) by the army in&nbsp;the field; (3) in harbour defence; and (4) to refer briefly to&nbsp;range-finders, not under these heads, of English and foreign&nbsp;design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. The necessity for a range-finder afloat caused the British Admiralty in 1891 to issue an advertisement in the press&nbsp;inviting inventors to produce an instrument which would,&nbsp;amongst other conditions, record ranges with an accuracy of&nbsp;within 3% at 3000 yds. The resulting competition was de-clared in favour of a range-finder which is the joint invention&nbsp;of Professor Barr of the Glasgow University and Professor&nbsp;Stroud of the Yorkshire College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The naval range-finder consists of a tube@@<sup>2</sup> which contains two telescopes. It is carried on a frame by bearings, in which the tube&nbsp;is free to revolve about its longer axis. To the frame&nbsp;is attached a weight capable of movement within a tank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This weight balances the range-finder and frame upon knife-edges. By means of the handle on the left of the&nbsp;instrument and an altitude worm beneath it, the motion of&nbsp;the tube is governed, and the line of sight is directed on&nbsp;the objective. By partially filling the tank with water, the&nbsp;swinging of the weight in a seaway can be checked. The frame is&nbsp;supported on a pedestal and can rotate in azimuth upon it (fig. 1).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">A rubber guard is fitted round the eye-pieces. Its functions are to guide the eyes of the observer into the correct position, and to&nbsp;protect them from side light and the distressing effect of wind. It&nbsp;also guards the forehead against the jar occasioned by firing heavy&nbsp;guns. The upper portion of the field presented to the left eye is&nbsp;used as a finder, the lower portion is occupied by the scale upon&nbsp;which the ranges are engraved. The finder is a low-power telescope&nbsp;of large field, to the centre of which the objective is brought. When&nbsp;the telescope is thus correctly aligned, the objective will be seen&nbsp;with the right eye largely magnified, but as two partial images&nbsp;separated by a thin black horizontal line. When coincidence of the&nbsp;images is effected by means of the working head, the range can be</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
