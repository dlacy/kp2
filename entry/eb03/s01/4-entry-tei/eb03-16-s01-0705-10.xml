in philoſophy, denotes any doctrines deduced from ſelf-evident principles.</p><p>Sciences may be properly divided as follows, 1. The knowledge of things, their conſtitutions, properties, and operations: this, in a little more enlarged ſenſe of the word, maybe called φυσιχη, or <hi rend="italic">natural philoſophy;</hi> the end of which is ſpeculative truth. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophy</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics.</hi> —2. The ſkill of rightly applying theſe powers, πϱαχτιη: The moſt conſiderable under this head is ethics, which is the ſeeking out thoſe rules and meaſures of human actions that lead to happiness, and the means to practiſe them (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy)</hi>; and the next is mechanics, or the application of the powers of natural agents to the uſes of life (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics).</hi> —3. The doctrine of ſigns, ϲημειωτιχη; the moſt uſual of which being words, it is</p><p>aptly enough termed <hi rend="italic">logic.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic.</hi></p><p>This, ſays Mr Locke, ſeems to be the moſt general, as well as natural, diviſion of the objects of our underſtanding. For a man can employ his thoughts about nothing but either the contemplation of things themſelves for the diſcovery of truth; or about the things in his own power, which are his actions, for the attainment of his own ends; or the ſigns the mind makes uſe of both in the one and the other, and the right ordering of them for its clearer information, All which three, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> things as they are in themſelves know able, actions as they depend on us in order to happineſs, and the right uſe of ſigns in order to knowledge, being <hi rend="italic">toto caelo</hi> different, they ſeem to be the three great provinces of the intellectual world, wholly ſeparate and diſtinct one from another.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
