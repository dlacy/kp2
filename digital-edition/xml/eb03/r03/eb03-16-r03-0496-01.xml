(Salvator), an admirable painter, born at Naples in 1614. He was firſt inſtructed by Franceſco Francazano, a kinſman : but the death of his father reduced him to fell drawings ſketched upon paper for any thing he could get ; one of which happening to fall into the hands of Lanfranc, he took him under his protection, and enabled him to enter the ſchool of Spagnoletto, and to be taught moreover by Daniel Falcone, a diſtinguiſked painter of battles at Naples, Salvator had a fertile imagination. He ſtudied nature with attention and judgment ; and always repreſented her to the greateſt advantage ; for every tree, rock, cloud, or fituation, that enters into his compofition, ſhows an elevation of thought that extorts admiration. He was equally eminent for painting battles, animals, ſea or land ſtorms ; and he executed theſe different ſubjects in ſuch taſte as renders his works readily di-ſtinguiſkable from all others. His pieces are exceedingly ſcarce and valuable ; one of the moſt capital is that repreſenting Saul and the witch of Endor, which was preſerved at Verſailles. He died in 1673; and as his paintings are in few hands, he is more generally known by his prints; of which he etched a great number. He painted landſcapes more than hiilory ; but his prints are chiefly hiſtorical. The capital landſcape of this matter at Chiſwick is a noble picture. However, he is ſaid to have been ignorant of the management of light, and to have ſometimes ſhaded faces in a diſagreeable manned He was however a man of undoubted genius; of which he has given frequent ſpeciinens in hiε works. A roving diſpofition, to which he is ſaid to have given full ſcope, ſeems to have added a wildneſs to all his thoughts. We are told that he ſpent the early part of his life in a troop of banditti ; and that the rocky defolate ſcenes</p>

<p>ifι which he was accuſtomed to take refuge, furniſhed him with thoſe romantic ideas in landſcape, of which he ’is ſo exceedingly fond, and in the deſcription of which he ſo greatly excels. His <hi rend="italic">robbers,</hi> as his detached figures are commonly called, are ſuppoſed alſo to have been taken from the life.</p><p>Salvator Roſa is ſuſſiciently known as a painter ; but until now we never heard of him as a muſician. Among the muſical manuſcripts purchaſed at Rome by Dr Burney, was a muſic book of Salvator, in which are many airs and cantatas of different ιna-fters, and eight entire cantatas, written, ſet, and tranſcribed by this celebrated painter himſelf. From the ſpecimen of his talents for mufic here given, we make no ſcruple of declaring, that he had a truer genius for this ſcience, in point of melody, than any of his predeceſſors or cotemporaries : there is alſo a ſtrength of expreſſion in his verſes, which ſets him far above the middle rank as a poet. Like moſt other aitiſts of real original merit, he complains of the ill uſage of the world, and the difficulty he finds in procuring a bare fubſiſtence.</p>
