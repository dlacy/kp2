<p><span class="font1">Adapted from a 13th-century poem, it has been considered as the work of Huon de Villeneuve based upon earlier chansons. Aymon&nbsp;de Dordogne, brother of Beuves d’Aigremont and of Girard de Roussillon, brings his four sons to the court of Charlemagne. They&nbsp;are knighted by the emperor, who makes a present of the marvellous steed Bayard to the eldest, Régnault. This is the charger&nbsp;pictorially represented as bearing all the four champions on his&nbsp;back at once. Bertholais, the nephew of Charlemagne, plays one&nbsp;day a game of chess with Régnault, and, losing, petulantly strikes&nbsp;his adversary, who smites him dead with the board. All the four&nbsp;sons of Aymon are compelled to fly and war is immediately declared&nbsp;against them as outlaws, in which their unhappy father, as the&nbsp;feudal vassal of Charlemagne, is obliged to take an active part.&nbsp;Numerous incidents of deadly peril and adventure on both sides&nbsp;are recorded, and Régnault displays so much daring, skill, and&nbsp;magnanimity as to create in the reader’s mind a hatred of the&nbsp;ungenerous monarch who relentlessly pursues the brothers. It&nbsp;will be remarked how singularly the character of Charlemagne has&nbsp;deteriorated from the earlier type. The famous Bayard plays a&nbsp;notable part in the story. On one occasion, by the help of his&nbsp;cousin, the enchanter Maugis (son of Charlemagne’s assassinated&nbsp;enemy Beuves), Régnault captures the emperor, Roland, Ogier,&nbsp;Naimes of Bavaria, and Turpin. Although they are in his power,&nbsp;the chivalrous knight and his brothers merely kneel to Charlemagne&nbsp;and beg for peace and pardon. The monarch’s hatred is implacable ; but Régnault nobly sets his captives free, and the war begins&nbsp;again. Régnault, who is lord of Montauban, a castle given him&nbsp;by Yvon, sovereign of Gascony, for having repelled a Saracen&nbsp;invasion, retires from the strife and makes a pilgrimage to Palestine. On his return he goes as a simple mason to aid in the building of Cologne cathedral, and is there slain by the treachery of&nbsp;his fellow-workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Maugis J Aigremont.—The special romance bearing this title (first printed about 1520) is not the only one in which Maugis the&nbsp;enchanter plays a prominent part. He is originally derived from&nbsp;the 13th-century poem on the four sons of Aymon, to whom he&nbsp;furnished material assistance in the struggle against Charlemagne.&nbsp;He also appears as a comrade and helper of Renaud in the Conquest&nbsp;of Trebisond, and again in the romance of Mabrian (1530), in&nbsp;which he is elected pope, and finally perishes in a cave to which&nbsp;Charlemagne sets fire. These are all three of late origin ; and the&nbsp;Conqueste de Trebisonde (s.a., about 1520) is not even of French composition, but is adapted from the 14th-century Italian poem of&nbsp;Trabisοnda. The four sons of Aymon, especially Régnault (Tasso’s&nbsp;hero Rinaldo), and their kinsman Maugis seem to have been especially dear to the Italian imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gerard J Euphrate.—This, printed in 1549, and professedly translated from a metrical Walloon original, is an absurd tale of magic, containing nothing except names to connect it with the ancient&nbsp;poem on Girard de Fratte, one of the vassals who warred against&nbsp;the emperor. Although split into two personages in course of&nbsp;time, Girard de Fratte (not d’Euphrate) and Girard de Roussillon&nbsp;seem to have been originally identical. Girard was one of the&nbsp;sons of Doon of Mayence, and therefore brother to Aymon. Consequently this romance may be placed in connexion with the&nbsp;Four Sons of Aymon, and also serves to link it with Garin de&nbsp;Montglane, as it is evident that Girard· de Vienne in the latter&nbsp;romance is only another form of the older Girard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Huon of Bordeaux.—This interesting story was compiled in prose in 1454, from a late form of a poem which was current towards the&nbsp;end of the 12th century, and which has often been attributed to&nbsp;the trouvère Huon de Villeneuve, but without reason. Huon, duke&nbsp;of Guienne, one of the paladins of Charlemagne, is on his way to&nbsp;Paris to pay his respects to his liege lord, when he is attacked by&nbsp;the malicious and envious Chariot, whom he kills in self-defence.&nbsp;The emperor' grieves so much for his son’s death that he dooms&nbsp;the unlucky Huon to death also, notwithstanding the intercession&nbsp;of all the peers and councillors. At last Huon is pardoned, but&nbsp;only on condition that he shall make a journey to the East and&nbsp;bring back from Baghdad a part of the Saracen amir’s beard and&nbsp;four of his back teeth, after having slain one of the Saracen lords&nbsp;and kissed the amir’s daughter before his face. These impossible&nbsp;tasks he is enabled to accomplish by the help of the pretty dwarf&nbsp;Oberon, who presents him with a magical cup and horn. A loud&nbsp;blast upon the latter suffices to bring Oberon and 100,000 warriors&nbsp;to his aid. At the most critical instant his magic powers fail him,&nbsp;simply because he had been guilty of deceit in announcing himself&nbsp;as a Mohammedan in order to gain entrance. The princess Esclar-monde has, however, fallen in love with him and succours him.&nbsp;He is at length brought out to fight the giant Agrapard, who has&nbsp;invaded Baghdad ; he conquers him, and tries to persuade the amir&nbsp;to turn Christian. Again when he is in danger, Oberon saves him ;&nbsp;and the teeth and beard are taken from the dead Saracen. Then&nbsp;begins a series of adventures full of peril and distress. Huon overcomes strong temptations practised on his chastity and the deadly&nbsp;straits in which he is placed by Saracen foes and treacherous kinsmen, and at last makes Esclarmonde his lawful wife and justifies&nbsp;himself before Charlemagne. Oberon always makes his appearance&nbsp;when the needs are sorest, and in fact plays the best part in the&nbsp;narrative. This romance has no connexion with the actual history&nbsp;of Charlemagne ; but it is an attractive work of imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Valentin et Orson.—This well-known and charming story, first printed in 1489, relates the lives of two brothers exposed in infancy, one of whom is suckled by a bear. After many adventures,&nbsp;they regain their rightful position and each learns his relationship.&nbsp;The events are supposed to take place in France in the time of&nbsp;Pippin. It is a composition of the 15th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Oetarnen, or Florent et Lyon, is a similar story, never printed in French, although written in that language, probably in the 15th&nbsp;century, from an episode of the Reali di Franeiα.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beuve JHanstοne, or, as he is called in English, Bevis of Hampton, is the subject of an old French story which was embodied in the&nbsp;Reali, and is only connected with Charlemagne by the mention of&nbsp;King Pippin and the hero’s kinship with the sons of Aymon. As a&nbsp;French prose romance it was printed by Vérard about 1500. It&nbsp;had been printed separately in Italian at Bologna in 1480. An old&nbsp;English poem on Bevis was in the 15th or 16th century turned&nbsp;into a prose romance, and was printed about 1560.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Morgant le Géant is only a translation of Pulci’s poem Morgante Maggiore, and Guerin Mesquin is similarly translated from an&nbsp;Italian prose recomposition of an old Italian poem. Little more&nbsp;than the names was derived from the old Charlemagne chansons de&nbsp;geste·, and the same may be said of the famous poems of Boiardo,&nbsp;Berni, and Ariosto upon Roland (Orlando).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Arthur had become in Britain not only a national hero</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of romance but also a leading figure around whom might be grouped the adventures of subordinate knights. Charlemagne filled a similar place for French writers, but had&nbsp;the advantage of being a more distinct historical character&nbsp;than Arthur. In the Iberian peninsula, where we find the&nbsp;next great cycle of stories, the circumstances which produced the national hero (the Cid) were still progressive,&nbsp;and his history was too real to melt into such romantic&nbsp;fiction as dealt in France and England with remote and&nbsp;shadowy paladins and the wonders of fairyland. Therefore, while the Cid had an ever-present reality in ballads,&nbsp;the earliest appearance of prose romance in Spain was in&nbsp;an artificial imitation of the Franco-British cycle. As it&nbsp;was a work of great merit, its fictitious hero became, as&nbsp;it were, the central figure in the stories w<sup>τ</sup>hich followed and&nbsp;which bore to one another a strong family likeness. Most&nbsp;of the chief heroes are illegitimate, like Amadis ; the adventures of two brothers are told ; and there is much similarity&nbsp;of incident and character. Many of the scenes are laid in&nbsp;Constantinople. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis de Gaula</span><span class="font2"> is the poetical sire of&nbsp;an extraordinary series of romances, which in the words&nbsp;of Cervantes</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> form an “inumerable linaje,” and is itself&nbsp;the most interesting and remarkable of them. Although&nbsp;its reputation is due to the Spanish redaction of Montalvo, there was an earlier Portuguese version by Vasco de&nbsp;Lobeira (d. 1403), a gentleman of the court of Joâo I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> Under Amadis of Gaul (vol. i. p. 650) may be seen the different references in Don Quixote to the romance.</span></p>
