<p><span class="font0">Billaud-Varenne, who were not afraid of blood, and who dared to look facts in the face and take the responsibility&nbsp;of doing while others were talking, were the men who&nbsp;made the 10th of August and took the Tuileries. The&nbsp;Girondins, however, were quite ready to take advantage of&nbsp;the accomplished fact ; and Robespierre, likewise, though&nbsp;shocked at the shedding of blood, was willing to take his&nbsp;seat on the commune of Paris, which had overthrown&nbsp;Louis XVI., and might check the Girondins. The strong&nbsp;men of the commune were glad to have Robespierre’s&nbsp;assistance, not because they cared for him or believed in&nbsp;him, but because of the help got from his popularity, his&nbsp;reputation for virtue, and his influence over the Jacobin&nbsp;Club and its branches, which spread all over France. He&nbsp;it was who presented the petition of the commune of&nbsp;Paris on lβth August to the legislative assembly, demanding the establishment of a revolutionary tribunal and the&nbsp;summons of a convention. The massacres of September&nbsp;in the prisons, which Robespierre in vain attempted to&nbsp;stop, showed that the commune had more confidence in&nbsp;Billaud than in him. Yet, as a proof of his personal&nbsp;popularity, he was a few days later elected first deputy&nbsp;for Paris to the national convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the meeting of the convention the Girondins immediately attacked Robespierre ; they were jealous of his popularity and knew that his single-hearted fanaticism&nbsp;would never forgive their intrigues with the king at the&nbsp;end of July, and would always be opposed to their plans&nbsp;for raising the duke of Orleans to the throne. As early&nbsp;as 26th September the Girondin Lasource accused him of&nbsp;aiming at the dictatorship ; afterwards he was informed&nbsp;that Marat, Danton, and himself were plotting to become&nbsp;triumvirs ; and eventually on 29th October Louvet attacked&nbsp;him in a studied and declamatory harangue, abounding in&nbsp;ridiculous falsehoods and obviously concocted in Madame&nbsp;Roland’s boudoir. But Robespierre had no difficulty in&nbsp;rebutting this attack (5th November). All personal disputes, however, gave way by the month of December&nbsp;1792 before the great question of the king’s trial, and&nbsp;here Robespierre took up a position which is at least&nbsp;easily understood. These are his words spoken on 3d&nbsp;December : “ This is no trial ; Louis is not a prisoner at&nbsp;the bar ; you are not judges ; you are—you cannot but&nbsp;be statesmen, and the representatives of the nation. You&nbsp;have not to pass sentence for or against a single man, but&nbsp;you have to take a resolution on a question of the public&nbsp;safety, and to decide a question of national foresight. It&nbsp;is with regret that I pronounce the fatal truth ; Louis&nbsp;ought to perish rather than a hundred thousand virtuous&nbsp;citizens ; Louis must die, that the country may live.”&nbsp;This great question settled by the king’s execution, the&nbsp;struggle between Robespierre and the Girondins entered&nbsp;upon a more acute stage, and the want of statesmanship&nbsp;among the latter threw upon the side of the fanatical&nbsp;Robespierre Danton and all those strong practical men&nbsp;who cared little for personal questions, and whose only&nbsp;desire was the victory of France in her great struggle&nbsp;with Europe. Had it been at all possible to act with that&nbsp;group of men of genius whom history calls the Girondins,&nbsp;Danton, Carnot, Robert Lindet, and even Billaud-Varenne&nbsp;would have sooner thrown in their lot with them than with&nbsp;Robespierre, whom they thoroughly understood ; but the&nbsp;Girondins, spurred on by Madame Roland, refused to&nbsp;have anything to do with Danton. Government became&nbsp;impossible; the federalist idea, which would have broken&nbsp;France to pieces in the very face of the enemy, grew and&nbsp;flourished, and the men of action had to take a decided&nbsp;part. In the month of May 1793 Camille Desmoulins,&nbsp;acting under the inspiration of Robespierre and Danton,&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire des Bmssotins</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bmssot devoile ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Isnard declared· that Paris must be destroyed; Robespierre preached insurrection at the Jacobin Club; and on 3lst&nbsp;May and 2d June the commune of Paris destroyed the&nbsp;Girondin party. For a moment it seemed as if France&nbsp;would avenge them ; but patriotism was stronger than&nbsp;federalism. The defence of Lyons only exasperated the&nbsp;men who were working for France, and the armies who&nbsp;were fighting for her, and on 27th July 1793, when the&nbsp;struggle was practically decided, the convention elected&nbsp;Robespierre to the committee of public safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This election marks an important epoch, not only in the life of Robespierre, but in the history of the Revolution.&nbsp;Danton and the men of action had throughout the last&nbsp;two years of the crisis, as Mirabeau had in the first two&nbsp;years, seen that the one great need of France, if she was&nbsp;to see the end of her troubles without the interference of&nbsp;foreign armies, was the existence of a strong executive&nbsp;government. The means for establishing the much-needed&nbsp;strong executive were found in the committee of public&nbsp;safety. The success of this committee in suppressing&nbsp;the Norman insurrection had confirmed the majority of&nbsp;the convention in the expediency of strengthening its&nbsp;powers, and the committee of general security which sat&nbsp;beside it was also strengthened and given the entire&nbsp;management of the internal police of the country. When&nbsp;Danton, who had been a member of the committee from&nbsp;April to lθth July 1793, left it Robespierre was elected;&nbsp;and it was not until then that he became one of the actual&nbsp;rulers of France. Indeed the committee was not finally&nbsp;constituted until the l3th of September, when the last&nbsp;two of the “great” twelve who held office until July 1794&nbsp;were elected. Of these twelve at least seven, Carnot,&nbsp;Billaud-Varenne, Collot d’Herbois, Prieur (of the Marne),&nbsp;Prieur (of the Côte d’Or), Jean Bon Saint-André, and&nbsp;Robert Lindet, were essentially men of action, all of whom&nbsp;despised rather than feared Robespierre owing to his supposed timidity, and were entirely free from his influence.&nbsp;Of the other four Hérault de Séchelles was a professed&nbsp;adherent of Danton ; Barère was an eloquent Provençal,&nbsp;who was ready to be the spokesman to the convention of&nbsp;any view which the majority of the committee might&nbsp;adopt ; and only Couthon and Saint-Just shared Robespierre’s political enthusiasm for the regeneration of France&nbsp;by the gospel of Rousseau. It is necessary to dwell upon&nbsp;the fact that Robespierre was always in a minority in the&nbsp;great committee in order to absolve him from the blame&nbsp;of being the inventor of the enormities of the Terror, as&nbsp;well as to deprive him of the glory of the gallant stand&nbsp;made against Europe in arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After this examination of Robespierre’s position it is not necessary to investigate closely every act of the great&nbsp;committee during the year which was pre-eminently the&nbsp;year of the Terror ; the biographer is rather called upon&nbsp;to examine his personal position with regard to the establishment of the Terror and the fall of the Hébertists and&nbsp;Dantonists, and then to dwell upon the last three months&nbsp;in which he stood almost alone trying to work up an&nbsp;effective counterbalance to the power of the majority of&nbsp;the great committee. The Terror was the embodiment of&nbsp;the idea of Danton, that it was necessary to have resort&nbsp;to extreme measures to keep France united and strong at&nbsp;home in order to meet successfully her enemies upon the&nbsp;frontier. This idea was systematized by the committee of&nbsp;public safety, or rather by two members of it acting for&nbsp;the majority, Billaud-Varenne and Collot d’Herbois, without much consideration as to who were to be the victims.&nbsp;With the actual organization of the Terror Robespierre had&nbsp;little or nothing to do ; its two great engines, the revolutionary tribunal and the absolute power in the provinces of&nbsp;the representatives on mission, were in existence before he</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
