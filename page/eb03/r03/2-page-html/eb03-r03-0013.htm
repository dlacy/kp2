<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Root, in algebra and arithmetic, denotes any num-. ber which, multiplied by itſelf once or oſtener, produces any other number ; and is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſquare, cube,&nbsp;biquαdrαte,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">root,</span><span class="font1"> according to number of multiplication?. Thus, 2 is the ſquare-root of 4 ; the cube-root of 8 ; the biquadrate-root of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">16, See.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROPE, is a word too familiar to need a definition ; and w<sup>r</sup>e need ſay no more than that it is only applied. to a conſiderable collection of twilled fibres.&nbsp;Smaller bands are called lines, ſtrings, cords ; and it is&nbsp;not applied with great propriety even to thoſe, unleſs&nbsp;they are compoſed of ſmaller things of the ſame kind&nbsp;twiſted together. Two hay bands twiſted together&nbsp;would be called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rope.</span><span class="font1"> All the different kinds of this&nbsp;manufacture, from a ſiſhing-line or whip cord to the&nbsp;cable of a firſt rate ſhip of war, go by the general name&nbsp;of Cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ropes are made of every ſubſtance that is ſuſſiciently fibrous, flexible, and tenacious, but chiefly of the barks&nbsp;of plants. The Chineſe and other orientals even make&nbsp;them of the ligneous parts of ſeveral plants, ſuch as certain bamboos and reeds,<sub>x</sub> the Items oſ the aloes, the fibrous covering of the cocoa nut, the filaments of the&nbsp;cotton pod, and the leaves of ſome graſſes, ſuch as the&nbsp;ſparte </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Lygeum,</span><span class="font1"> Linn.) The aide </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Agave,</span><span class="font1"> Linn.)&nbsp;and the ſparte exceed all others in ſtrength. But the&nbsp;barks of plants are the moſt productive oſ fibrous matter&nbsp;fit for this manufacture. Thoſe of the Linden tree.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Teloa),dl</span><span class="font1"> the willow, the bramble, the nettle, are&nbsp;frequently uſed : but hemp and flax are of all others&nbsp;the beſt ; and of theſe the hemp is preferred, and employed in all cordage exceeding the lize of a line, and&nbsp;even in many of this denomination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hemp is very various in its uſeſul qualities. Theſe are great ſtrength, and the length and ſineneſs oſ the&nbsp;fibre. Being a plant oſ very greedy growth, it ſucks&nbsp;up much of the unaltered juices of the foil, and therefore difi⅛rs greatly according to its toil, cljmate, and&nbsp;culture. The beſt in Europe comes to us through&nbsp;Riga, to which port it is brought from very diſtant&nbsp;places to the fouthw∙ard. It is known by the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riga rein</span><span class="font1"> (that is, clean) hemp. Its fibre is not the&nbsp;longeſt (at leaſt in the dreſſed ſtate in which we get it)&nbsp;of all others, but it is the ſineſt, moſt flexible, and&nbsp;ſtrongeſt. The next to this is ſuppoſed to be the Pe-terſhurgh braak hemp. Other hemps are eſteemed&nbsp;nearly in the following * der :—Riga outſhot, Peterſ-burgh outſhot, hemp from Koningſhurgh, Archangel,&nbsp;Sweden, Memel. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chucking</span><span class="font1"> is a name given to a hemp&nbsp;that comes from various places, long in the fibre, but&nbsp;coarſe and harſh, and its ſtrength is inferior to hemps&nbsp;which one would think weaker. Its texture is ſuch,&nbsp;that it does not admit ſplitting with the hatchet ſo as&nbsp;to be more completely dreſſed. It is therefore kept in&nbsp;its coarſe form, and uſed for inferior cordage. It is&nbsp;however a good and ſtrong hemp, but wall not make&nbsp;fine work. There are doubtleſs many good hemps in&nbsp;the ſouthern parts of Europe, but little of them is&nbsp;brought to our market. Codilla, half clean, &amp;c. are&nbsp;portions of the above-mentioned hemps, ſeparated by&nbsp;the dreffiπg, and may be conſidered as broken fibres oſ&nbsp;thoſe hemps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Only the firſt qualities are manufactured for the rigging of the royal navy and for the flιips of the Eaſt India company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rop5-.∙.!Λ~ing is an art of very great importance; and there are few that better deſerve the attention of&nbsp;the intelligent obſerver. Hardly any art can be carried on without the aſſiſtance oſ the rope-maker. Cordage makes the very ſinevvs and muſcles of a ſhip; and</span><span class="font1"><sup>,&nbsp;</sup>every improvement which can be made in its prépara-'&nbsp;tiυn, either in reſpect to ſtrength or pliablenefs, muſt&nbsp;be of immenſe ſervice to the mariner, and t√ the commerce and the defence of nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We ſhall give a very ſhort account of the manufacture, which will not indeed fully inſtruct the artificers, but will give ſuch a view of the proceſs as ſhall enable&nbsp;the reader to judge, from principle, of the propriety of&nbsp;the different parts of the manipulation, and perceive its&nbsp;defects, and the means ſor removing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The aim oſ the rope-maker is to unite the ſtrength of a great number oſ fibres. This would be done in&nbsp;the completed manner by<sup>r</sup> laying the fibres parallel to J&nbsp;each other, and faltening the bundle at the two ends : <sub>1&nbsp;</sub>but this would be of very limited uſe, becauſe the fibres are ſhort, not exceeding three feet and a half at an&nbsp;average. They muſt therefore be entangled together,&nbsp;in ſuch a manner that the ſtrength of a fibre ſhall not&nbsp;be able to draw<sup>r</sup> it out from among the reſt of the bundle. This is done by twilling or twining them together, which cauſes them mutually to compreſs each&nbsp;other. When the fibres are ſo diſpoſed in a long&nbsp;, ſkain, that their ends ſucceed each - other along its&nbsp;length, without many of them meeting in one place,&nbsp;and this ſkain is twiſted round and round, we may cauſe&nbsp;them to compreſs each other to any degree we pleaſe,&nbsp;and the friction on a fibre which we attempt to pull&nbsp;out may be more than its coheſion can overcome. It&nbsp;will therefore break. Conſequently, if we pull at this&nbsp;twiſted ſkain, we will not ſeparate it by drawing&nbsp;one parcel out from among the </span><span class="font0">reſt, </span><span class="font1">but the whole&nbsp;fibres will break ; and if the diſtribution of the fibres&nbsp;has been very equable, the fi&lt;ain will be nearly of the&nbsp;ſame ſtrength in every part. If there is .any part&nbsp;where many ends of fibres meet, the ſkain will break</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in that part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know very well that w-e can twiſt a ſkain of fibres ſo very hard, that </span><span class="font0">it </span><span class="font1">will break with any attempt&nbsp;to twiſt it harder. In this ſtate all the fibres are already ſtrained to the utmoſt of their ſtrength. Such a&nbsp;ſkain of fibre· can have no ſtrength. It cannot carry a&nbsp;weight, becauſe each fibre is already ſtrained in the&nbsp;ſame manner as if loaded with as much weight as it is&nbsp;able to bear. What we have ſaid of this extreme caſe&nbsp;is true in a certain extent of every degree of twiſt that&nbsp;we give the fibres. Whatever force is actually exerted&nbsp;by a twuſted fibre, in order that it may ſuſſiciently compreſs the reſt to hinder them from being drawn out,&nbsp;muſt be conſidered as a weight hanging on that fibre,&nbsp;and muſt be deduced from its abſolute ſtrength of coheſion, before we can eſtimate the ſtrength of the ſkain.&nbsp;The ſtrength </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the ſkain is the remainder of the abſolute ſtrength of the fibres, after we have deduced the&nbsp;force employed in twuſting them together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this obſervation may be deduced a fundamental principle in rope-making, that all twiſting, beyond what is neceſſary ſor preventing the fibres from being&nbsp;drawm out without breaking, diminiſhes the ſtrength of&nbsp;the cordage, and ſhould be avoided when in our power.&nbsp;It is of importance to keep this in mind.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
