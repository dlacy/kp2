<p><span class="font1">over which there is a less depth than either above or below it. The lowering of such a bar forms one of the main&nbsp;objects of river improvement, as upon the depth that can&nbsp;be obtained over the bar depend the class of vessels that&nbsp;can enter the river, and, in tidal rivers, the period of time&nbsp;during which the entrance can be navigated. A bar may&nbsp;result from the action of the sea, which tends to form a&nbsp;continuous beach across any inlet, and would obliterate&nbsp;the mouths of rivers if the channels were not maintained&nbsp;by the ebb and flow of the tide and the fresh-water discharge ; or it may be formed by the conflict of the sea&nbsp;and river water, which checks the current at the mouth&nbsp;and causes the river to deposit the sediment which it held&nbsp;in suspension. The bars at the mouths of the Mersey, the&nbsp;Liffey, and the Adour are due to the first cause; whilst the&nbsp;bars at the mouths of tideless rivers, such as the Mississippi, the Danube, and the Rhone, are mainly due to the&nbsp;second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Improvement of Tidal Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tidal rivers differ greatly in their natural characteristics, owing to the variety in the different conditions which affect them. Thus the Mersey, with an extreme&nbsp;tidal rise of 30 feet at its mouth, is only tidal for 46&nbsp;miles, whilst the Seine, with a rise of 22 feet, is tidal for&nbsp;91 miles, and the Scheldt, with a rise of only 13 J feet, is&nbsp;tidal up to Ghent, a distance of 105 miles. These differences are mainly due to the different falls of the riverbeds, but they are also affected by the facility of entry&nbsp;afforded to the flood tide, and the form of the channel up&nbsp;which it flows. The tidal capacity of a river depends on&nbsp;the rise of the tide and the configuration of the banks.&nbsp;The tidal flow into the Mersey amounts to 710,000,000&nbsp;cubic yards at a high spring tide, whilst the flow into the&nbsp;Scheldt at Flushing, with less than half the tidal rise,&nbsp;reaches 475,000,000 cubic yards. The tidal capacity of&nbsp;the Seine, together with its estuary, formerly exceeded&nbsp;that of the Mersey, but it has been greatly reduced by the&nbsp;training works which have been carried out on it since&nbsp;1848.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tidal ebb and flow passing and returning through the entrance channels of a river twice a day exercise a&nbsp;very important influence on its maintenance. The effect&nbsp;of tidal scour is manifested in the history of the harbours&nbsp;of Calais and Ostend,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> which in old times possessed deep&nbsp;outlet channels, but were injured by reclamation, and in&nbsp;the deterioration of the outfalls of the Fen rivers as soon&nbsp;as the tidal flow was curtailed by the erection of sluices.&nbsp;The power of the tidal scour necessarily varies with the&nbsp;volume of water producing it, and therefore one of the&nbsp;first principles of tidal river improvement is that the tide&nbsp;should be admitted as far up a river as possible, and all&nbsp;obstructions to its flow removed. If, however, the maintenance of an estuary depended solely upon the tidal ebb&nbsp;and flow, the estuary would gradually silt up, for the&nbsp;flood tide brings in matter in suspension which it washes&nbsp;from the adjacent shores and sandbanks, especially during&nbsp;rough weather, when the waves stir up the sand and silt.&nbsp;The impetus of the tide running up the rising bed of an&nbsp;estuary is gradually checked, till at last slack water&nbsp;occurs, and the silt begins to deposit, which the ebb tide,&nbsp;enfeebled by the friction of the tidal water in its passage&nbsp;up and down the estuary, would of itself be unable completely to remove. The erection of any obstructions to&nbsp;the tidal flow, such as sluices and weirs, increases the&nbsp;period of slack tide, and consequently not only reduces the&nbsp;volume of ebb and flow but also promotes the deposit of&nbsp;silt, to the further detriment of the estuary. The maintenance of estuaries is secured by the aid of their freshwater discharge, which, being penned up during the flood&nbsp;tide, reinforces the ebb and preserves an equilibrium.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> L. F. Vernon-Harcourt, Harbours and Docks, pp. 149 and 155.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The fresh-water discharge of a river, depending upon the area of the basin and the available rainfall, naturally&nbsp;varies greatly in different rivers—being, for instance, greater&nbsp;in the Tyne and the Clyde than in the Mersey, though&nbsp;these rivers have little more than one-thirteenth of the&nbsp;tidal capacity of the Mersey. The Seine, with a drainage&nbsp;area of 30,500 square miles, nearly six times the size of&nbsp;the Thames basin, has a discharge of 28,000,000 cubic&nbsp;yards, on the average, each tide (about twenty-eight times&nbsp;that of the Mersey), though this volume sinks into insignificance when compared with the flow of the Danube with&nbsp;a basin of ten times the size, or still more of the Mississippi with a basin forty times as large. A large freshwater discharge is of great value to the maintenance of an&nbsp;estuary, especially when, as in the case of the Seine, it&nbsp;carries little silt in suspension; whilst a small discharge in&nbsp;proportion to the size of an estuary, of which the Mersey&nbsp;is a notable instance, renders the state of the estuary very&nbsp;delicate, and necessitates great vigilance in maintaining its&nbsp;tidal capacity, to which its existence is almost wholly due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The silt brought down by tidal rivers, instead of being carried to their mouths and there deposited, is met by the&nbsp;incoming tide at points varying daily with the states of&nbsp;the tides ; and, moreover, except during slack tide, it is&nbsp;maintained in constant motion up and down the estuary,&nbsp;till at length it gets to the sea. Accordingly, though the&nbsp;sediment of tidal rivers is more or less deposited wherever&nbsp;the velocity of the current is checked, it does not tend to&nbsp;accumulate in one particular part, as in the case of tideless&nbsp;rivers, and therefore the formation of a bar at the mouth&nbsp;is mainly due to the drift by waves along the beach. A&nbsp;flood also, though more largely charged with silt, by giving&nbsp;additional power to the ebb, scours the channel and lowers&nbsp;the bar. The Humber, whose waters are densely burdened&nbsp;with mud which is readily deposited in still water, is&nbsp;nevertheless free from a bar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best form of estuary for a tidal river is when it enlarges gradually as it approaches the sea, thus affording&nbsp;an increasing capacity for the admission of the tide, and&nbsp;promoting a regular flow. The estuaries approximating to&nbsp;such a form are generally free from bars—as, for instance,&nbsp;the Thames, the Severn, and the Scheldt. When, however, a river expands abruptly into a wide estuary on a&nbsp;sandy coast, it winds through the enlarged estuary in an&nbsp;unstable shallow channel, owing to the reduced velocity of&nbsp;the ebb in expanding out, and the checking of the flood&nbsp;tide on reaching the head of the wide estuary. Thus the&nbsp;Seine, with a deep stable channel from Rouen to La&nbsp;Mailleraye, had formerly a shallow shifting dangerous&nbsp;channel from thence to the sea ; the Ribble, with a good&nbsp;depth at Preston, has a shoal irregular channel towards&nbsp;its mouth ; and the Dee, with a moderate channel at&nbsp;Chester, is almost barred to vessels, except at high tide,&nbsp;below Connah’s Quay. These estuaries do not possess a&nbsp;well-defined bar, but their long shallow winding channels&nbsp;offer a still more serious impediment to navigation. The&nbsp;worst form is a very irregular estuary with abrupt expansions and contractions, of which the Mersey is a prominent example, for, in spite of its large rise of tide, it&nbsp;possesses a shallow, irregular, and shifting channel above&nbsp;Liverpool, and is encumbered by a wide bar below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are three obstructions to which tidal rivers are subject, namely, a bar, a shifting channel, and inadequacy&nbsp;of depth ; and there are three general methods which may&nbsp;be resorted to for their improvement, namely, jetties,&nbsp;training walls, and dredging, in addition to the regulation&nbsp;of their upper portion by longitudinal jetties, or banks, as&nbsp;previously mentioned.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
