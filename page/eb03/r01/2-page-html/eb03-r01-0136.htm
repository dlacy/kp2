<p><span class="font1">to the direction DC of their motion, they muſt deflect to both ſides equally, and in equal portions, becauſe&nbsp;no reaſon can be affigned why more ſhould go to either&nbsp;ſide. By this means the filament EF, which would&nbsp;have ſtruck the ſurface in G, is deflected </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">before it arrives&nbsp;at</span><span class="font1"> the ſurface, and deſcribes a curved path EFIHK,&nbsp;continuing its rectilineal motion to I, where it is inter-cepted by a filament immediately adjoining to EF, on&nbsp;the fide of the middle filament DC. The different particles of DC may be ſuppoſed to impinge in fucceſſion&nbsp;at C, and to be deflected at right angles ; and gliding&nbsp;along CB, to eſcape at B. Each filament in ſucceſſion,&nbsp;outwards from DC, is deflected in its turn ; and being&nbsp;hindered from even touching the ſurface C B, it glides&nbsp;off in a direction parallel to it ; and thus EF is deflected in I, moves parallel to CB from Ito H, and is again&nbsp;deflected at right angles, and deſcribes H K parallel to&nbsp;DC. The ſame thing may be ſuppoſed to happen on&nbsp;the other ſide of DC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And thus it would appear, that except two filaments immediately adjoining to the line DC, which bifects&nbsp;the ſurface at right angles, no part of the fluid makes&nbsp;any impulſe on the furface AB. All the other filaments&nbsp;are merely preffed againſt it by the lateral filaments&nbsp;without them, which they turn aſide, and prevent from&nbsp;ſtriking the ſurface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In like manner, when the fluid ſtrikes the edge of a priſm or wedge ACB (fig. 7.), it cannot be ſaid-that&nbsp;any real impulfe is made. Nothing hinders us from&nbsp;fuppoſing C a mathematical angle or indiviſible point,&nbsp;not fufceptibiè of any impulſe, and ſerving merely to di-vide the ſtream. Each filament EF is effectually pre-vented from impinging at G in the line of its. direction,&nbsp;and with the obliquity of incidence EGC, by the filaments between EF and DC, which glide along the furface CA ; and it may be ſuppoſed to be deflected when&nbsp;it comes to the line CF which bifects the angle DCA,&nbsp;and again deflected and rendered parallel to D C at I.&nbsp;The lame thing happens on the other ſide of DC ; and&nbsp;we cannot in this caſe affert that there is any impulſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we now ſee plainly how the ordinary theory muſt be totally unfit for furniſhing principles of naval architec-ture, even although a formula could be deduced from&nbsp;fueh a feri.es of experiments as thoſe. of the French Aca-demy. Although we ſhould know preciſely the im-pulſe, or, to ſpeak now more cautiouſly, the action, of&nbsp;the fluid on a furface G L (fig8.) of any obliquity,&nbsp;when it is alone, detached from all others, we cannot'&nbsp;in the ſmalleſt degree tell what will be the action of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">part</span><span class="font1"> of a ſtream of ſtuid advancing towards it, with the&nbsp;fame obliquity, when it is preceded by an adjoining fur-face CG, having a different inclination ; for the ſtuid&nbsp;will not glide along G L in the ſame manner as if it&nbsp;made part of a more extenfive furface having the ſame&nbsp;inclination. The previous deflexions are extremely different in theſe two caſes ; and the previous deflections&nbsp;are the only changes which we can obſerve in the motions of the fluid, and the only cauſes of that pfeffure&nbsp;which we obferve the body to ſuſtain* and which we&nbsp;call the impulfe on it. This theory muſt, therefore, be&nbsp;quite unfit for afcertaining the action on a curved furface, which may be confidered as made up of an indeſi-n∙ite number of ſucceſſive planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We now feewit⅛ equal evidence how it happens that</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the action of fluids </span><span class="font0">on </span><span class="font1">ſolid bodies may and muſt be oppoſed by preffures, and may be compared with and mea-ſured by the preffure of gravity, we are not compa-ring forces of different kinds&gt; percuſſions with-preffwesj but preffures with each other. Let us ſee whether&nbsp;this view of the ſubject will afford us any method ol&nbsp;compariſon or abſolute meafurement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when a filament cf fluid, that is, a row- of corpuſcles, are turned out of their courſe EF (ſig. 6. ), and forced&nbsp;to take another courſe IH, force is required to produce&nbsp;this change of direction. The filament is prevented&nbsp;from proceeding by other filaments which lie between it&nbsp;and the body, and which deflect it in the ſame manner&nbsp;as if it were contained in a bended tube, and it will&nbsp;prefs on the concave filament next to it as it would prefs&nbsp;on the concave ſide of the tube. Suppoſe ſuch a bend-ed tube ABE (ſig. 9.), and that a ball A is projected&nbsp;along it with any velocity, and moves in it without fric∙&nbsp;tron : it is demonftrated, in elementary mechanics, that&nbsp;the ball will move with undiminilhed velocity, and will&nbsp;preſs on every point, fuch as B, of the concave ſide of&nbsp;the tube, in a direction BF perpendicular to the plane&nbsp;CBD, which touches the tube in the point B* This&nbsp;preffure on the adjoining filament, on the concave ſide&nbsp;of its path, muſt be withſtood by that filament which&nbsp;deflects it ; and it muſt be propagated aeroſs that Alarment to the next, and thus augment the preffure upon&nbsp;that next filament already preffed by the deflection of&nbsp;the intermediate filament and thus there is a preffure&nbsp;towards the middle filament, and towards the body, ari-ſing from the deflection of all the outer filaments ; and&nbsp;their accumulated ſum muſt be conceived as immediate*&nbsp;ly exerted on the middle filaments and on the body, be*&nbsp;cauſe a perfect ſiuid tranſmits every preffure undimi»&nbsp;niſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The preffure BF is equivalent to the two BH, BG, one of which is· perpendicular, and. tlie other parallel,&nbsp;to the direction, of the original motion. By the ſirſt&nbsp;(taken in any point of the curvilineal motion of any filament), the two halves of the ſtream are preffed together ; and in the caſe of ſig. 6. and 7. exactly balance&nbsp;each other.. But the preffures, ſuch as BG, muſt be&nbsp;ultimately withſtood by the ſurface ACB ; and it is by&nbsp;theſe accumulated preffures that the ſolid body is urged&nbsp;down the ſtream ;.and it is theſe accumulated preffures&nbsp;which we obſerve and meafure in our experiments. WC&nbsp;ſhall anticipate a little, and ſay that ibis moſt eaſily de-monſtrated, that when a ball A (ſig. 9. ) moves with un-diminiſhed velocity in a tube ſo incurvated that its axis&nbsp;at E is at right angles to its axis at A, the accumulated&nbsp;action of the preii’ures, ſuch as&lt; B G-, taken for every&nbsp;point of the path, is preciſely equal to the force which&nbsp;would produce or extinguiſh the original motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This being the caſe, it follows moſt obvioufly, that if the. two motions oſ the filaments are ſuch as we have de-ſcribed and repreſented by fig. 6. the whole preffure in the&nbsp;direction of the ſtream, that is, the whole preffure which&nbsp;can be obſerved on the ſurface, is equal to the weight of a&nbsp;column of fluid having the ſarface for its baſe, and twice&nbsp;the fall productive of the velocity for its height, pre-ciſely as Newtcn deduced it from other conſiderations ;&nbsp;and it feems to make no odds whether the fluid be elaſ-tic or unelaſtic, if the deflections and velocities are the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">fame.
