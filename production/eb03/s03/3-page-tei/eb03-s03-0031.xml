All partialities, however, are prejudices, and prejudices of the worst kind. They ought therefore to be guarded againſt with the utmoſt care, by the ſame means which we have elſewhere recommended (ſee Prejudice and Metaphysics, n⁰ 98.); and he who is partial to his own virtue or his own knowledge, will do well to compare the former, not with the conduct of his neighbour, but with the expreſs rule of his duty ; and to conſider the latter as no farther valuable than as it contributes to the ſum of human happiness.</p><p>SELIM I. emperor of the Turks, was the second ſon of Bajazet II. He made war upon his father, and though defeated in 1511, he at laſt dethroned him and took him priſoner, and immediately diſpatched him by poison, together with his elder brother Achmet, and his younger Korkud, an amiable and enlightened prince. Having eſtabliſhed his throne by theſe crimes, he marched againſt Carnpſon-Gaury ſovereign of Egypt, gained a great victory at Aleppo, and flew their general. But though the ſultan periſhed in that battle, the Mameluks determined to oppoſe the emperor. Selim entering their country at the head of his army, defeated the Egyptians in two battles, and ordered Toumonbai, the new elected ſultan, who had fallen into his hands, to be hung on a gibbet. He then took Cairo and Alexandria, and in a ſhort time reduced all Egypt to ſubjection. Thus ended the dominion of the Mameluks in Egypt, which had continued for more than 260 years. He confirmed the ancient privileges of the Venetians in Egypt and Syria, by which they carried on their commerce with India, and formed a league with them to deſtroy the power of the Portugueſe in that country. (See India, n⁰ 37). Selim had before this gained a great victory over the Perſians, and ſtripped them of Tauris and Keman. He was preparing to attack Chriſtendom when he was ſeized with an ulcerous fore in the back. Thinking that the air of Adrianople would reſtore his health, he ordered himſelf to be conducted thither ; but he died at Clari in Thrace on his road to that city, in the year 1520, in the very ſpot where he had poiſoned his father. He reigned 8 years, and lived 54. He was a prince of great courage, sobriety, and liberality ; he was fond of hiſtory, and wrote ſome verſes. But theſe good qualities were obſcured by the moſt abominable crimes that ever diſgraced human nature : he made his way to the throne by ſhedding the blood of his father, and ſecured it by murdering his brothers and eight nephews, and every baſhaw who had been faithful to his duty.</p><p>SELINUM. in botany : A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 45th order, Urnbellatee.

He went from England, in</p><p>1703, in the capacity of ſailing-maſter of a ſmall vessel called the Cinque-Ports Galley, Charles Pickering captain, burthen about 90 tons, with 16 guns and 63 men ; and in September the ſame year sailed From Corke, in company with another ſhip of 26 guns and 120 men, called the St George, commanded by that famous navigator William Dampier, intending to cruize on the Spaniards in the South Sea. On the coaſt of Brazil, Pickering died, and was ſucceeded in his command by his lieutenant Thomas Stradling. They proceeded on their voyage round Cape Horn to the iſland of Juan Fernandes, whence they were driven by the appearance of two French ſhips of 36 guns each, and left five of Stradling’s men there on ſhore, who were taken off by the French. Hence they sailed to the coaſt of America, where Dampier and Stradling quarrelled, and ſeparated by agreement, on the 19th of May 1704. In September following, Stradling came again to the iſland of Juan Fernandes, where Selkirk and his captain had a difference, which, with the circumſtance of the ſhip's being very leaky, and in bad condition, induced him to determine on ſtaying there alone ; but when his companions were about to depart, his resolution was ſhaken, and he desired to be taken on board again. The captain, however, refuſed to admit him, and he was obliged to remain, having nothing but his clothes, bedding, a gun, and a ſmall quantity of powder and ball ; a hatchet, knife, and kettle ; his books, and mathematical and nautical inſtruments. He kept up his ſpirits tolerably till he ſaw the vessel put off, when (as he afterwards related) his heart yearned within him, and melted at parting with his comrades and all human ſociety at once.</p><p>“— Yet believe me, Arcas,</p><p>Such is the rooted love we bear mankind,</p><p>All ruffians as they were, I never heard A found so diſmal as their parting oars.”</p><p>Thomſon's Agamemnon.</p><p>Thus left sole monarch of the iſland, with plenty of the necessaries of life, he found himſelf in a ſituation hardly ſupportable. He had fiſh, goat’s flesh, turnips and other vegetables ; yet he grew dejected, languid, and melancholy, to such a degree as to he ſcarce able to refrain from doing violence to himſelf. Eighteen months pasſed before he could, by reaſoning, reading his bible, and ſtudy, be thoroughly reconciled to his condition. At length he grew happy, employing himſelf in decorating his huts, chasing the goats, whom he equalled in ſpeed, and ſcarcely ever failed of catching, He also tamed young kids, laming them to prevent their becoming wild ; and he kept a guard of tame cats about him, to defend him when aſleep from the rats, who were very troublesome. When his clothes were worn out, he made others of goats skins, but could not ſucceed in making ſhoes, with the uſe of which, however, habit, in time, enabled him to diſpenſe. His only liquor was water. He computed that he had caught 1000 goats during his abode in the iſland; of which he had let go 500, after marking them by flitting their ears. Commodore Anson’s people, who were there about 30 years after, found the firſt goat which they ſhot upon landing was thus marked, and as it appeared to be very old, concluded that it had been under the power of Selkirk. But it appears by captain Carteret’s account of his voyage in the Swallow ſloop, that other persons practiſed this mode of marking, as he found a</p></body></text></TEI>
