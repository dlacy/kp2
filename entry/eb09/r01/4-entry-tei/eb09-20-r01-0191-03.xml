                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rabbenu Eli'ezer</hi> B. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nathan</hi>
                    of Mainz—was one of the most famous Halakhic teachers of the 12th century. He
                    lived at Mainz and corresponded with Rashi’s son-in-law, Rabbenu Meir b.
                    Shemuel, and his three distinguished sons, <hi rend="smallcaps">Rashbam</hi>
                    (7.v.), Ribain (R. Yishak b. Meir, who died young and left seven orphans), and
                    Rabbenu Tham (R. Ya'akob). His great Halakhic work, צפנת פענח, or אבן העזר, is
                    commonly called by the combination of the author’s initials which heads this
                    article, the Book of Rābān, and was printed at Prague in 1610 fol. <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> The thanks of the
                        writer of these lines are due to the curators and librarian of the Bodleian
                        for the loan of this book. </note> Other Halakhic literature by him is to be
                    found in <hi rend="italic">Kol Bo,</hi> § 123 (without place or date, but
                    probably Naples, towards the end of the 15th century), and its reprints. More
                    lies in MS. in libraries ; thus the <hi rend="italic">Eben Haroshah,</hi> of
                    which no other copy is known, is preserved in the Cambridge University Library
                    (Add., 498). R. Eli'ezer was also a fine liturgical poet, vying both in
                    senti-ment and elegance with the poets of the Sèpharadic school, as appears, for
                    example, from the Ophan and other pieces designed for a Sabbath when there is a
                    circumcision. Rabbenu Eli'ezer died in the 12th century. The date 5007 ( = 1247)
                    which appears in the formulas of a bill of divorcement and a deed of manumission
                    of a slave is most assuredly due to a scribe of the 13th century, who in
                    transcribing Räbän’s book conformed the date to his own time—a practice often to
                    be met with.</p>                <p>Dr A. Jellinek of Vienna has published a <hi rend="italic">History of the First
                        Crusade</hi> (1קונטרס מרות תתנ״, Leipsic, 1854, 8vo)—a little book
                    interesting in more than one way—which bears the name of Râbân. It cannot,
                    however, be by the subject of this article, as one can see by comparing with his
                    genuine work the questionable poetic stuff which forms part of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Konteres.</hi> The author is no doubt Räbän of Cologne. Nor
                    does the commentary on אל אלהים (for Pentecost eve) under the title of מאמר
                    השכל, which has been often printed, and of which the Cambridge Library has an
                    old MS. (Add., 493, 1),</p>                <p>בדק לן and זבי לי מתנתא. The <hi rend="italic">Tosaphoth</hi> and printed
                    editions <hi rend="italic">(ll.ee.)</hi> put Rabb <hi rend="smallcaps">āh</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> for Rābā; but Rashi’s traditional reading (בך
                    שמעתי) must be right. For, in the first place, it would have been on the part of
                    the Talmud superfluous to state that Rabbāh and Abayye were of the house of Eli,
                    seeing that the latter was the son of the brother of the former. And secondly,
                    the story goes <hi rend="italic">(Rosh Hasshanah, l.c.)</hi> that he who only
                    studied the Law died at the age of forty (Abayye living to sixty), whereas the
                    synchronisms of Rabbāh’s life show that he must have lived to a much greater
                    age.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb09-20-r01-0192" facs="encyclopediabrit20newyrich_raw_0210.jp2"/>
                <p>belong to this Rābān, though it has been ascribed to him for 600 years. Its
                    writer was undoubtedly a Provençal. (S. M. S. - S. )</p>            </div>
