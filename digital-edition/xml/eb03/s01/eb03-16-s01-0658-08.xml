a concrete juice brought from Perſia and Arabia, in ſmall whitiſh-yellow grains, with a few of a reddiſh and ſometimes of a deep red colour mixed with them; the wſhiteſt tears are preferred, as being the freſheſt: its taſte is bitter, accompanied with a dull kind of ſweetneſs. This drug diſſolves in watery liquors, and appears chiefly to be of the gummy kind, with a ſmall admixture of reſinous matter. It is principally celebrated for conglutinating wounds and ulcers (whence its name σαρχοχολλα <hi rend="italic">flesh-glue);</hi> a quality which neither this nor any other drug has any juſt title to.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
