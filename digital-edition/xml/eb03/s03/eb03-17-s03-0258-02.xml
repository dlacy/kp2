 is a mineral water which ſprings up at Lower Seltzer, a village in the electorate of Triers, about 10 miles from Frankfort on the Mayne.</p><p>It is a very uſeful medicinal water. It contains, according to ſome, a very ſrnall portion of calcareous earth, of a native mineral alkali, and an acid ; but of theſe the quantity is too ſmall to attribute any medicinal virtues to ; but it contains alſo near 1.7th of its bulk of fixed air, which is more than is found in any other mineral water, and to this it owes its principal virtues. Others have ſaid that it is of the very same nature with Pyrmont water, and contains a ſubtile aqueous fluid, a volatile iron, and a predominant alkali, all joined together into one briſk ſpirituous water. The conſequence of theſe different opinions reſpecting its conſtituent parts is, that different methods have been recommended for imitating it.</p><p>According to the former analyſis, artificial Seltzer water may be prepared by adding one ſcruple of magneſia alba, six ſcruples of foſſil alkali, and four ſcruples of common ſalt, to each gallon of water, and ſaturating the water with fixed air or carbonic acid. According to the latter it may be imitated by adding to a quart of the pureſt and lighteſt water thirty drops of a ſtrong ſolution of iron made in ſpirit of ſalt, a drachm of oil of tartar per deliquium, and thirty drops of ſpirit of vitriol, or a little more or leſs as is found neceſſary, not to let the alkali of the oil of tartar prevail too ſtrongly, tho’ it must prevail a little. If the proportions be carefully obſerved, and the whole of theſe ingredients ſhaken briſkly together, the artificial Seltzer or Pyrmont water thus made will ſtrongly reſemble the natural, and have the ſame good effect in medicine.</p><p>But as fixed air is the only efficacious medicinal part of the compoſition of Seltzer water, the beſt method of imitating it is by impregnating common water with that acid by a proceſs for which we are indebted to Dr Prieſtley. The firſt idea of this kind occurred to him in 1767, when, having placed ſhallow veſſels of water within the region of fixed air, on the ſurface of the fermenting veſſels of a brewery, and left them all night in that ſituation, he found that the water had acquired a very ſenſible and pleaſant impregnation. He proceeded to accelerate the impregnation by pouring the water from one veſſel into another, while they were both held within the ſphere of the fixed air. The method of effecting this by air diſlodged from chalk and other calcareous ſubſtances did not occur to him till the year 1772, when he publiſhed his directions for this purpoſe, together with a drawing of the neceſſary apparatus, which he had before communicated to the Board of Admiralty. That apparatus has now given way to another invented by Dr Nooth, which is made of glaſs, and ſtands on a wooden veſſel <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> (fig 1.) reſembling a tea-board: the middle veſſel B has a neck which is inſerted into the mouth of the veſſel A, to which it is ground air-tight. The lower neck of the veſſel B has a glaſs ſtopper S, compoſed of two parts, both having holes ſufficient to let a good quantity of air paſs through them. Between theſe two parts is left a ſmall ſpace, containing a plano-convex lens, which acts like a valve, in letting the air paſs from below upwards, and</p><p>hindering its return into the veſſel A. The upper veſſel C terminates below in a tube <hi rend="italic">rt,</hi> which being crooked, hinders the immediate aſcent of the bubbles of fixed air into that veſſel, before they reach the ſurface of the water in the veſſel B. The veſſel C is alſo ground airtight to the upper neck or the middle veſſel B, and has a ſtopper <hi rend="italic">p</hi> fitted to its upper mouth, which has a hole through its middle. The upper veſſel C holds just half as much as the middle one B ; and the end <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the crooked tube goes no lower than the middle of the veſſel B.</p><p>For the uſe of this apparatus : Fill the middle veſſel B with ſpring or any other wholeſome water, and join to it the veſſel C. Pour water into the veſſel A (by the opening <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> or otherwiſe) ſo as to cover the riſing part of its bottom : for this about three-fourths of a pint will be ſufficient. Fill an ounce phial with oil of vitriol, and add it to the water, ſhaking the veſſel ſo as to mix them well together. As heat is generated, it will be beſt to add the oil by a little at a time, otherwiſe the veſſel may be broken. Put to this, through a wide glaſs or paper funnel, about an ounce of powdered raw chalk or marble. White marble being firſt granulated, or pounded like coarſe fand, is better for the purpoſe than pounded chalk, becauſe it is harder ; and therefore the action of the diluted acid upon it is flower, and laſts to a conſiderable time. On this account the ſupply of fixed air from it is more regular than with the chalk ; and beſides, when no more air is produced, the water may be decanted from the veſſel A, and the white ſediment waſhed off, and the remaining granulated marble may be employed again, by adding to it freſh water and a new quantity of oil of vitriol. The funnel in this proceſs is made uſe of, in order to prevent the powder from touching the inside of the veſſel’s mouth ; for if that happens, it will ſtick ſo ſtrongly to the neck of the veſſel B as not to admit of their being ſeparated without breaking. Place immediately the two veſſels B and C (fattened to each other) into the mouth of the veſſel A, as in the figure, and all the fixed air which is diſengaged from the chalk or marble by the oil of vitriol will paſs up through the valve in S into the veſſel B. When this fixed air comes to the top of the veſſel B, it will diſlodge from thence as much water as is equal to its bulk ; which water will be forced up through the crooked tube into the upper veſſel C.</p><p>Care muſt be taken not to ſhake the veſſel A when the powdered chalk is put in ; otherwiſe a great and ſudden efferveſcence will enſue, which wall perhaps expel part of the contents. In this cafe it may be necesſary to open a little the ſtopper p <hi rend="italic">,</hi> in order to give vent, otherwiſe the veſſel A may burſt. It will be proper alſo to throw away the contents and waſh the veſſel; for the matter will ſtick between the necks of the veſſels, and cement them together. The operation muſt then be begun afreſh. But if the chalk be put into the veſſel looſely wrapt up in paper, this accident will he ſtill better guarded againſt. When, the efferveſcence goes on well, the veffel C will ſoon be filled with water, and the veſſel B half filled with air ; which will eaſily be known to be the caſe by the air going up in large bubbles through the crooked tube r <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p><p>When this is obſerved, take off the two veſſels B and C together as they are, and ſhake them ſo that the water and air within them may be much agitated. A great<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0265.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0259"/>
part of the fixed air will be abſorbed into the water, as will appear by the end of the crooked tube being considerably under the ſurface of the water in the vessel. The ſhaking them for two or three minutes will be ſufficient for this purpoſe. Theſe veſſels must not be ſhaken while joined to the under one A, otherwiſe too great an efferveſcence will be occaſioned in the latter, together with the ill conſequence above mentioned. After the water and air have been ſufficiently agitated, looſen the upper veſſel C, ſo that the remaining water may fall down into B, and the unabſorded air pass out. Put theſe veſſels together, and replace them into the mouth of A, in order that B may be again half filled with fixed air. Shake the veſſels B and C, and let out the unabſorbed air as before. By repeating the operation three or four times, the water will be ſufficiently impregnated.</p><p>Whenever the efferveſcence nearly ceaſes in the veſſel A, it may be renewed by giving it a gentle ſhake, ſo that the powdered chalk or marble at the bottom may be mixed with the oil of vitriol and water, above it ; for then a greater quantity of fixed air will be diſengaged. When the efferveſcence can be no longer renewed by ſhaking the veſſel A, either more chalk muſt be put in, or more oil of vitriol ; or more water, if neither of theſe produce the deſired effect.</p><p>Mr Magellan has ſtill further improved this contrivance. He has two ſets of the vessels B and C. While he is ſhaking the air and water contained in one of theſe ſets, the other may be receiving fixed air from the vessel A. By this means twice the quantity of water may be impregnated in the same time. He has a wooden ſtand on which to fix the veſſels B, C, when taken off from A, which is very convenient. He has a ſmall tin trough for meaſuring the quantity of chalk or marble requisite for one operation, and a wide glaſs funnel for putting it through into the veſſel A, to prevent its flicking to the ſides, as mentioned before.</p><p>He has alſo contrived a ſtopper without a hole, to be uſed occasionally inſtead of the perforated one <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> It muſt be of a conical figure, and very looſe ; but ſo exactly and ſmoothly ground as to be air-tight merely by its preſſure. Its uſe is to compreſs the fixed air on the water, and thereby increaſe the impregnation. For by keeping the air on the water in this compreffed ſtate, the latter may be made to ſparkle like champaign. And if the veſſels are ſtrong, there will be no danger of their burſting in the operation.</p><p>The water thus impregnated may be drawn out at the opening <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> But if it is not wanted immediately, it will be better to let it remain in the machine, where it has no communication with the external air ; otherwiſe the fixed air flies off by degrees, and the water becomes vapid and flat. But it may be kept a long time in bottles well stopped, especially if they are placed with their mouths downwards.</p><p>Dr Withering of Birmingham has lately contrived a new apparatus for impregnating water with fixed air, which, he ſays, is preferable to that in common uſe, becauſe it can be made at less expence, and is more eaſily prepared ; becauſe the whole quantity of fixable air produced is converted to uſe, without any waste of the vitriolic acid ; becauſe it impregnates three times the quantity of water at one time more completely and with leſs trouble; and the impregnated water will al</p><p>ways retain its virtue, if the joints and cocks of the machine are made perfectly air-tight ; for which purpoſe they ſhould once a-year be ſupplied with a ſmall quantity of unſalted lard. This apparatus is exhibited by fig. 2. and consists of a glaſs veſſel A, about ten inches high in the cylindrical part, and six inches and a half in diameter ; another glaſs veſſel B, about twelve inches high in the conical part, one inch and a half in the neck, and five inches in diameter at the bottom ; a copper pipe C paſſing through the ſtopper of the veſſel B, and tied faſt in the flexible tube D, made of ſtrong leather, air-tight, and kept hollow by means of a ſpiral wire paſſing through its whole length ; a conical braſs pipe E, with a ſtop-cock fattened to the tube D ; another conical pipe F, with a ſtop-cock G, into which the end of the tube E is accurately ground ſo as to be air-tight, and cutting off all communication with the atmoſphere when the pipe E is removed ; two large hog’s bladders H, H, each of which ought to hold two quarts ; a ſtop-cock I to prevent the water riſing into the bladders when the veſſel A is agitated ; a bladder K tied to the crooked tube with the ſtop-cock L, which occaſionally opens or ſhuts the communication with the veſſel B ; a glaſs funnel M, accurately fitted with the glaſs ſtopper N ; an aperture O, fitted with a glaſs ſtopper or a ſilver cock, from which the impregnated water is to be drawn for uſe ; and, laſtly, the tube P opening into the veſſel A. When this apparatus is uſed, let the veſſel A be filled with pure water, and any other ingredients that are required, in a proper proportion ; into the veſſel B put as much marble or whiting, in ſmall lumps, as will cover its bottom to the height of about two inches, and pour in water to the height repreſented by the dotted line ; let the mouth of the veſſel A be well fitted with a cork, and through a hole in the cork paſs the tube P, putting upon the cork melted sealing-wax of the ſofteſt kind, or modelling-wax, ſo as to make the whole air-tight. Let the mouth of the veſſel B be flopped with a piece of mahogany, turned into a conical figure in a lathe, and of a ſize ſomewhat larger than the mouth of the glaſs will admit ; put this piece of wood into melted bees-wax, and heat the wax till the wood begins to grow black: when cool, turn it again till it fits the mouth of the veſſel : the tubes C, L, and M are fitted into holes and bored through the wooden ſtopper previous to its being immerſed in the wax ; puſh theſe tubes through the holes, and preſs the ſtopper into the orifice of the vessel B, and cement the whole with ſealing or modelling-wax ; ſhut the ſtop-cocks I and L, having previouſly preſſed the air out of the bladder K : open the ſtop-cocks G and E ; then ſqueeze the air out of the bladders H, H, and afterwards preſs the conical pipe E into the pipe F ; pour about a large ſpoonful of oil of vitriol through the funnel M, and ſtop it with its ſtooper N. The fixable air let looſe by the efferveſcence in the veſſel B, riſing through the tube C, paſſes into the bladders H, H, and diſtends them. In this caſe open the ſtop-cock I, and from the aperture O draw out about a quart of water ; and the ſpace before occupied by the water will be filled with fixable air, which ſoon begins to be abſorbed by the remaining water, and is ſtill ſupplied from the bladders H, H, and from the eſſerveicing mixture in the veſſel B. When the bladders are considerably collapſed, more vitriolic acid muſt be added through the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0266.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0260"/>
funnel M, ſo that they may be always kept pretty fully diſtended. When an impregnation is ſpeedily required, turn the ſtop-cocks at G and E, and open that at L ; then ſeparate the pipe E from the tube F, and agitate the veſſel A ; the fixable air will paſs into the bladder K, and may be preſſed into the two other bladders, when the parts of the apparatus are united. During the agitation, the ſtop-cock at I ſhould be cloſed, and opened only occasionally to ſupply out of the bladders H, H, the fixable air abſorbed by the water. If a ſtrong impregnation be required, this proceſs ſhould be carried on in a room, the heat of which docs not exceed forty-eight degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. Dr Withering obſerves, that the impregnated water receives no taſte from the bladders ; and that if the veſſel A with its impregnated water be ſeparated from the veſſel B at the conical parting E, F, it may be incloſed in a pyramidal mahogany caſe, out of the lower part of which the ſilver cock at O projects ; and thus ſerve for an ornamental as well as luxurious and ſalubrious addition to the ſide-board, particularly in the ſummer and autumnal ſeaſons.</p><p>The artificial mineral waters thus made, are more pleaſant to the taſte than the natural Pyrmont or Seltzer waters ; which, besides their fixed air, contain ſaline particles of a diſagreeable taſte, which are known to contribute little or nothing to their medicinal virtues, and may, in ſome cafes, be hurtful. They are likewiſe conſiderably ſtronger. According to Sir John Pringle, theſe waters may be made more nearly to reſemble genuine Pyrmont water, by adding to each pint of them from eight to ten drops of <hi rend="italic">tinctura martis cum sρiritu ſalis.</hi> Or this may be done, by adding to the water in the middle veſſel B (fig. ι.), in the proportion of about thirty grains of Epſom ſalt, ten grains of common ſalt, a ſcruple of magneſia alba, and a dram of iron filings or iron wire, clean and free from ruſt, to one gallon of spring water, and impregnating the whole with fixed air in the mariner already deſcribed. Let them remain, till the other ingredients and as much of the iron as is neceſſary are diſſolved ; which will be in two or three days : or the magneſia may be omitted, and then the operation will be finiſhed in leſs than half that time. Theſe waters may be rendered ferruginous or chalybeate very eaſily, by putting in the middle veſſel two or more ſlender phials, filled with cuttings of fine iron-binding wire, or with small iron nails ; becauſe the impregnated water will diſlblve the iron ſo faſt, as to become well ſaturated with it in a few hours, according to the experiments of Mr Lane. But the method of rendering theſe artificial waters chalybeate, uſed by Dr Hulme, is to add one grain of ſalt of ſteel to each pint (ſixteen ounces) of water already impregnated with fixed air.</p><p>But the ingenious Mr Bewley has invented a ſtill better method of exhibiting fixed air as a medicine. He directs a ſcruple of alkaline ſalt to be diſſolved in a ſufficient quantity (a quarter of a pint, or leſs) of water, which is to be impregnated with as much fixed air as it can imbibe : this is to be taken at one doſe. Mr Bewley directs it to be prepared in larger quantities at a time, and calls it his mephitic julep. If immediately after it a ſpoonful of lemon juice, mixed with two or three ſpoonfuls of water, and ſweetened with ſugar, be drunk, the fixed air will be extricated in the ſtomach ; and thus a much greater quantity of it may be given than the ſame quantity of water alone can be made to imbibe. Fixed air acts as a corroborant ; and therefore may be given with ſuceeſs in weakneſs of the ſtomach, and in vomitings ariſing from that cause. It has alſo been given with ſucceſs in the ſtone and in nephritic complaints. When the lungs are purulent, fixed air mixed with the air drawn into the lungs has repeatedly been found to perform a cure. The bark also may be given with advantage in water impregnated with fixed air, as they both coincide in their effect. Fixed air may be applied by means of a ſyringe, funnel, or otherwise, to inflamed breaſts, putrid ulcers, mortified parts, ulcerated ſore throats, and has been found in ſuch and similar caſes to have very remarkable efficacy. It may alſo be given internally at the same time. In putrid dyſenteries, and in putrid ſtools, fixed air may be given by way of clyſter. Fermenting cataplasms are of ſervice, chiefly as they ſupply fixed air to the part. In caſes of putridity fixed air has been ſucceſsfully applied to the ſurface of the body expoſed to ſtreams of it. It is alſo found an excellent cooling as well as ſtrengthening beverage in hot relaxing weather, and has the advantage of being pleaſant to the taſte.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
