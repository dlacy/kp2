<p><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">thin film of radioactive matter of one kind is taken, the particles which escape without absorption are found to be homo-geneous and consist of particles projected at an identical&nbsp;speed. Observations of the velocity and mass of the particle&nbsp;have been made by Rutherford. The general method employed&nbsp;for this purpose is similar to that used for the determination&nbsp;of the velocity and mass of the electron in a vacuum tube.&nbsp;The deflection of a pencil of rays in a vacuum is determined&nbsp;for both a magnetic and electric field. From these observations the velocity and value </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∣</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"> (the ratio of the charge carried&nbsp;by the particle to its mass) are determined. The value of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"> has been found to be the same for the particles from all&nbsp;the types of radioactive matter that have been examined,&nbsp;indicating that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particles from all radioactive substances&nbsp;are identical in mass. The value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"> found for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle&nbsp;is 5‧07 X 10<sup>3</sup>. Now the value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"> for the hydrogen atom set&nbsp;free in the electrolysis of water is 9660. On the assumption&nbsp;that the value of the charge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"> is the same for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle as&nbsp;for the hydrogen atom, the value would indicate that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">particle has about twice the mass of the hydrogen atom, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">has the same mass as the hydrogen molecule. If the charge&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle is twice that on the hydrogen atom, the value&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font2"> indicates that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle is a helium atom, for the&nbsp;latter has an atomic weight of four times that of hydrogen.&nbsp;It was difficult at first to decide between these and other hypotheses, but we shall show later that there is now no doubt&nbsp;that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle is in reality a helium atom carrying two&nbsp;elementary charges. We may consequently regard the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> rays&nbsp;as a stream of helium atoms which are projected from a radio-active substance with a high velocity. The maximum velocity&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particle from radium is 2×10<sup>9</sup>cms. per second, or one-fifteenth of the velocity of light. Although the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α </span><span class="font2">rays are the&nbsp;least penetrating of the radiations, it will be seen that they&nbsp;play an extremely important part in radioactive phenomena.&nbsp;They are responsible for the greater part of the ionization and&nbsp;heating effects of radioactive matter and are closely connected&nbsp;with the transformations occurring in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under ordinary experimental conditions the greater part of the ionization observed in a gas is due to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> particles.&nbsp;This ionization due to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> rays does not extend in air at&nbsp;atmospheric pressure for more than 7 cms. from radium, and&nbsp;8∙6 cms. from thorium. If a screen of aluminium about ‧01 cms.&nbsp;thick is placed over the active material, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> rays are completely absorbed, and the ionization above the screen is then&nbsp;due to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">γ</span><span class="font2"> rays alone. If a layer of lead about 2 mms.&nbsp;thick is placed over the active material, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> rays are stopped,&nbsp;and the ionization is then due almost entirely to the penetrating&nbsp;γ rays. By the use of screens of suitable thickness we are&nbsp;thus able to sift out the various types of rays. These three&nbsp;types </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">radiations all set up secondary radiations in passing&nbsp;through matter. A pencil of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> rays falling on matter is widely&nbsp;scattered in all directions. This scattered radiation is sometimes called the secondary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> rays. The 7 rays give rise to&nbsp;secondary rays which consist in part of scattered 7 rays and in&nbsp;part electrons moving with a high velocity. These secondary&nbsp;rays in turn produce tertiary rays and so on. The impact of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> rays on matter sets free a number of slow moving electrons&nbsp;which are very easily deflected by a magnetic or electric field.&nbsp;This type of radiation was first observed by J. J. Thomson,&nbsp;and has been called by him the δ rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Emanations or Radioactive Gases. —</span><span class="font2">In addition to their power of emitting penetrating radiations, the substances thorium,&nbsp;actinium and radium possess another very striking and im-portant property. Rutherford (15) in 1900 showed that thorium&nbsp;compounds (especially the oxide) continuously emitted a&nbsp;radioactive emanation or gas. This emanation can be carried&nbsp;away by a current of air and its properties tested apart from&nbsp;the substance which produces it. A little later Dorn showed&nbsp;that radium possesses a similar property, while Giesel and&nbsp;Debierne observed a similar effect with actinium. These&nbsp;emanations all possess the property of ionizing a gas and, if&nbsp;sufficiently intense, of producing marked photographic and&nbsp;phosphorescent action. The activity of the radioactive gases&nbsp;is not permanent but disappears according to a definite law&nbsp;with the time, viz. the activity falls off in a geometric progression with the time. The emanations are distinguished&nbsp;by the different rates at which they lose their activity. The&nbsp;emanation of actinium is very shortlived, the time for the&nbsp;activity to fall to half value, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> the period of the emanation,&nbsp;being 3∙7 seconds. The period of the thorium emanation is&nbsp;54 seconds and of the radium emanation 3*9 days. This property of emitting an emanation is shown in a very striking&nbsp;manner by actinium. A compound of actinium is wrapped in a&nbsp;sheet of thin paper and laid on a screen of phosphorescent&nbsp;zinc sulphide. In a dark room the phosphorescence, marked&nbsp;by the characteristic scintillation, is seen to extend on all sides&nbsp;from the active body. A puff of air is seen to remove the&nbsp;emanation and with it the greater part of the phosphorescence.&nbsp;Fresh emanation immediately diffuses out and the experiment&nbsp;may be repeated indefinitely. The emanations have all the&nbsp;properties of radioactive gases. They can be transferred from&nbsp;point to point by currents of air. The emanations can be&nbsp;separated from the air or other gas with which they are mixed&nbsp;by the action of extreme cold. Rutherford and Soddy (16)&nbsp;showed that under ordinary conditions the temperature of&nbsp;condensation of the radium emanation mixed was - 150<sup>0</sup> C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The emanations are produced from the parent matter and escape into the air under some conditions. Rutherford and&nbsp;Soddy (17) made a systematic examination of the emanating&nbsp;power of thorium compounds under different conditions. The&nbsp;hydroxide emanates most freely, while in thorium nitrate,&nbsp;practically none of the emanation escapes into the air. Most&nbsp;of the compounds of actinium emanate very freely. Radium&nbsp;compounds, except in very thin films, retain most of the emanation in the compound. The occluded emanation can in all&nbsp;cases be released by solution or by heating. On account of&nbsp;its very slow period of decay, </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font2">emanation of radium can be&nbsp;collected like a gas and stored, when it retains its characteristic&nbsp;properties for a month or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Induced Activity. —</span><span class="font2">Curie (18) showed that radium possessed another remarkable property. The surface of any body placed&nbsp;near radium, or still better, immersed in the emanation from&nbsp;it, acquires a new property. The surface after removal is&nbsp;found to be strongly active. Like the emanations, this induced&nbsp;activity in a body decays with the time, though at quite a&nbsp;different rate from the emanation itself. Rutherford (19)&nbsp;independently showed that thorium possessed a like property.&nbsp;He showed that the bodies made active behaved as if a thin&nbsp;film of intensely active matter were deposited on their surface.&nbsp;The active matter could be partly removed by rubbing, and&nbsp;could be dissolved off by strong acids. When the acid was&nbsp;evaporated the active matter remained behind. It was shown&nbsp;that induced activity was due to the emanations, and could not&nbsp;be produced if no emanation was present. We shall see that&nbsp;induced activity on bodies is due to a deposit of non-gaseous&nbsp;matter derived from the transformation of the emanations.&nbsp;Each emanation gives a distinctive active deposit which decays&nbsp;at different rates. The active deposits of radium, thorium and&nbsp;actinium are very complex, and consist of several types of&nbsp;matter. Several hours after removal from the emanation the&nbsp;active deposit from radium decays to half-value—26 minutes,&nbsp;for actinium half-value—34 minutes, for thorium half-value—&nbsp;10∙5 hours. The active deposits obtained on a platinum wire&nbsp;or plate are volatilized before a white heat, and are again de-posited on the cooler bodies in the neighbourhood. Rutherford&nbsp;showed that the induced activity could be concentrated on the&nbsp;negative electrode in a strong electric field, indicating that the&nbsp;radioactive carriers had a positive charge. The distribution&nbsp;of the active deposit in a gas at low pressure has been investigated in detail by Makower and Russ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Radioactive Transformations. —</span><span class="font2">We have seen that the radioactive bodies spontaneously and continuously emit&nbsp;a great number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font2"> particles. In addition, new types&nbsp;of radioactive matter like the emanations and active deposits</span></p>
