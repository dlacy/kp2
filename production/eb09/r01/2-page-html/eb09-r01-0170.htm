<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to what must be the final result of this historical as well as comparative study, a morphological classification of&nbsp;religions. Here the study of religions reaches its goal,&nbsp;and the task of the philosophy of religion, the other main&nbsp;branch of the so-called science of religion or general&nbsp;theology, begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It need scarcely be said that the basis of the comparative historical study of religions must be a patient and critical examination of the sources from which the knowledge of the various religions of the world is to be drawn,&nbsp;viz., written documents and traditions, monuments and&nbsp;works of art, sacred writings and heretical books, and,&nbsp;when we wish to inquire into the religions of the uncivilized tribes that have no history at all, an impartial&nbsp;weighing of the evidence brought by travellers and settlers&nbsp;from different parts of the globe,—in short, an unbiassed&nbsp;ascertaining of facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Genealogical Classification.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> —There is no difficulty in determining the descent and relationship of religions&nbsp;which have taken rise in historical times, such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, and some others of minor importance. But the&nbsp;great majority of ancient religions had their origin in prehistoric times, of which neither documents nor trustworthy&nbsp;traditions are extant. In that case their mutual relation&nbsp;has to be established by reasoning from the myths, ideas,&nbsp;rites, and characteristics common to them. Professor Max&nbsp;Müller (.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on tlie Science of Religion</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, pp. 154 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">suggests that, whatever classification has been found&nbsp;most useful in the science of language ought to prove&nbsp;equally useful in the science of religion. Now it may be&nbsp;true in general, at least for the most ancient times, that&nbsp;where the languages of a group of nations are proved to&nbsp;belong to one family their religions too most probably&nbsp;“hold together by the same relationship.” But this&nbsp;hypothesis requires proof, and that proof is not to be&nbsp;obtained otherwise than by the comparative study of the&nbsp;religions themselves. Only when the religions of two&nbsp;independent nations agree in doctrine and mode of worship, above all in the notion of the relation between God&nbsp;and man, between the divine and the human, to such a&nbsp;degree and in such a manner that this agreement cannot&nbsp;be accounted for by the universal aspirations and wants of&nbsp;human nature, then only may we feel sure that the one of&nbsp;these religions is the parent of the other, or that both&nbsp;have come from a common stock. If not only two but&nbsp;several religions agree in like manner, or nearly so, we get&nbsp;a family, of religions. At present we can go no farther.&nbsp;The mutual relations of the different families cannot be&nbsp;determined yet; the problem is too difficult and too complicated to be solved in the present state of science. That&nbsp;religions belonging to different families have borrowed&nbsp;myths and customs from one another and have been subjected to one another’s influence may easily be proved.&nbsp;But whether the families themselves are branches of one&nbsp;and the same old tree is an open question to which a&nbsp;satisfactory answer cannot be given now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be equally premature to venture on drawing up a complete genealogical table of religions. For some&nbsp;families of religions such a classification may be sketched&nbsp;with tolerable certainty; the genealogy of by far the&nbsp;greater number of them can be given in mere outlines&nbsp;only, leaving the fixing of details for further inquiry. We&nbsp;start from what may be held the most certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aryan or Indo-Germanic Family</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Comparative mythology and the history of religion leave no doubt that all the religions of the Aryan or Indo-Germanic nations, viz.,&nbsp;Eastern Aryans (or Indians, Persians, and Phrygians) and&nbsp;Western Aryans (or Greeks, Romans, Germans, Norsemen,&nbsp;Letto-Slavs, and Celts), are the common offspring of one</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">| primitive </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old-Aryan@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">religion. That the same name of the highest heaven-god, Dyaus, Zeus, Ju(piter), Zio (Ty),&nbsp;is met with among Indians, Greeks, Italiotes, Germans,&nbsp;and Norsemen, however great the difference of the attributes and dignity ascribed by each of them to the god&nbsp;thus named may be, is a fact now generally known.&nbsp;Where this name has been lost, as is the case with the&nbsp;Persians, the Slavs, and the Celts, there are other divine&nbsp;names which they have in common with their kindred&nbsp;nations. Still more important is the fact that most&nbsp;Aryans show a tendency to call their supreme god&nbsp;“father,” as is proved by the very common forms Dyaus&nbsp;pitar, Zeus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">TvaTTjp,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jupiter, Diespiter, Marspiter, AlfbcTr.&nbsp;The supreme god in the Avesta, Ahuramazda, is often&nbsp;called father. Moreover many divine names used by&nbsp;different Aryan nations, though varying in form, are&nbsp;derived from the same root,—which proves the original&nbsp;unity of their conception. Take as examples the root </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">di&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">div</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">), “to shine,” and its derivatives Dyaus, Deva, and&nbsp;their family, Diti, Aditi, Dione, Pandion, Dionysos, Diovis,&nbsp;Dianus (Janus), Diana, Juno ; or the root </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">man,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> “ to think ”&nbsp;(perhaps equally signifying originally “to shine”), and its&nbsp;derivatives Manu, Minos, Minerva, (Juno) Moneta; or the&nbsp;roots </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sur</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">svar), sar, mar, vas.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Especially startling is the&nbsp;use of the same general word for “ god ” among several&nbsp;Aryan nations, viz., Skr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deva,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Iran, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">daeva,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Lat. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Litth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dewas</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (deiwys), Old Norse </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tivar</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (plur.), to which&nbsp;belong perhaps also Greek </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6e6&lt;s,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Irish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dia,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cyinr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deiv.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Daeva and deiwys are used in a bad sense, but this cannot&nbsp;be original. So too the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">asura</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ahura),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which,&nbsp;though it too was used by the Indians in relatively modern&nbsp;times in a bad sense, was the name which the East-Aryans&nbsp;gave to their highest gods, and the Norse </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">asa,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> pi. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eesir&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(orig. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ans),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> are both to be derived from the root </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as, a?ih.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">If we add to this the remarkable conformity of the myths&nbsp;and customs in all Aryan religions,—if, above all, by comparing them with those of other races, especially of the&nbsp;Semites, we find that the leading idea embodied in these&nbsp;Aryan myths and rites is everywhere the same, however&nbsp;different the peculiar character of each religion may be,&nbsp;namely, the close relation between God and man, the real&nbsp;unity between the divine and the human economy,@@<sup>2</sup> so&nbsp;that we may call them the “ theanthropic ” religions,—if&nbsp;we remember this, there can be no doubt that all of them&nbsp;have sprung from one primitive </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old-Aryan</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">However, the degree in which the Aryan religions are mutually related is not always the same. None of them&nbsp;came directly from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old-Aryan</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">religion. They consist&nbsp;of five pairs, each of which must have been first a unity:—&nbsp;the Indo-Persian, the Graeco-Roman, the Letto-Slavic, the&nbsp;Norse-Teutonic, and the Gaelo-Cymric. The fact that the&nbsp;members of those pairs are more closely allied with one&nbsp;another than with the other members of the family obliges&nbsp;us to assume five prehistoric Aryan religions:—the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old&nbsp;East-Aryan,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old Pelasgic,@@<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old Win dig,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old German,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Old Celtic</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">religions, forming&nbsp;so many links between those historical religions and the&nbsp;common parent of all,—the primeval </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Ar yan</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Space forbids us to give the complete proof of this conclusion. We only mention that the Indian and Iranian religions have many gods in common, unknown to the Western&nbsp;Aryans, and therefore probably such as arose after the&nbsp;eastern and western branch of the family had separated, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Mitra—Mitlira, Ary am an—Airyaman, Bhaga—Bagha—&nbsp;Baga (comp, also Aramati—Armaiti, Sarasvati—Hara-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
