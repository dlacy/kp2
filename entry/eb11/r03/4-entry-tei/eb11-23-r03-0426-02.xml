               <p>                   <label>ROCHE, SIR BOYLE</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bart.</hi> (1743-1807),
                    Irish soldier and politician, famous for his “ bulls,” came of a branch of the
                    family of the Viscounts Fermoy. He served in the American War, and sat in the
                    Irish parliament from 1777 onwards, being created a baronet in 1782 for his
                    loyalty to the government. He supported the Union, and one of his recorded “
                    bulls ”—many, however, being only fastened on him—was his declaration that he
                    would have “ the two sisters ” (England and Ireland) “ embrace like one
                    brother.” Sir Boyle Roche was a characteristically witty and genial Irishman,
                    and was master of the ceremonies at Dublin Castle.</p>            </div>
