an agreement of affections and inclinations, or a conformity of natural qualities, humours, and temperaments. Sympathy also denotes the quality of being affected by the affection of another, and may subsist either between different persons or bodies, or between different parts of the same body. It is either similar or dissimilar ; similar when the affection or action in the sympathiser is similar to the affection or action in the sympathant, and dissimilar when these are different. Sympathy, too, is often an imitative faculty, sometimes involuntarily, frequently without consciousness. Thus we yawn when we see others yawn, and are made to laugh by the laughing of another.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
