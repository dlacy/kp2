<p><span class="font1">This looseness of the marriage bond, as was naturally to be expected, had its effect on the other family relations. The&nbsp;right of children to take their father’s inheritance began to&nbsp;be lightly esteemed. The law—or rather the interpretation&nbsp;put upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit</span><span class="font1"> of the XII. Tables—had empowered&nbsp;him testamentarily to disinherit them, or in instituting them&nbsp;to limit their right to a mere fraction of the inheritance; but&nbsp;it was assumed that this power would be exercised with&nbsp;discretion and only when justified by circumstances. But&nbsp;in the later days of the Republic, amid the slackened ties of&nbsp;domestic life, paternal as well as conjugal duty seems to have&nbsp;often been lost sight of, and children were disinherited or cut&nbsp;off with a nominal share of the inheritance in order that a&nbsp;stranger might be enriched. This led to the recognition by&nbsp;the centumviral court, without apparently any legislative&nbsp;enactment or praetor’s edict to warrant it, of what was called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">querela inafficiosi testamenti—</span><span class="font1">challenge of a testament&nbsp;by a child whose natural claims had been capriciously and&nbsp;causelessly disregarded. While the practice may for a time&nbsp;have been hesitating and uncertain, yet early in the empire,&nbsp;through means of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">querela,</span><span class="font1"> the rule came to be established&nbsp;that every child was entitled, notwithstanding the terms of&nbsp;his father’s testament, to at least a fourth </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pert io legilima,&nbsp;quarta legitima)<sup>@@2</sup> </span><span class="font1">of what would have come to him had his&nbsp;parent died intestate, unless it appeared that the latter had&nbsp;had adequate grounds for excluding him or limiting him to a&nbsp;smaller share. A parent might in like manner challenge an&nbsp;undutiful testament made by his child to his prejudice; and&nbsp;ultimately in certain cases so might brothers and sisters&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter se.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The decline of morals had an equally marked effect on the transactions of daily life, calling for precautions and remedies&nbsp;that had not been found requisite in the hey-day of the&nbsp;rtarts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">t&amp;v</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> ''Pctifudwv.</span><span class="font1"> Men no longer relied on each other’s&nbsp;good faith unless backed by stipulations, securities </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cautiones)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and guarantees. The Rutilian bankruptcy arrangements and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio Pauliana</span><span class="font1"> for setting aside alienations in fraud of&nbsp;creditors indicate a laxity in mercantile dealings that was&nbsp;perhaps an inevitable consequence of the growth of trade&nbsp;and commerce. But, that such remedies as, for example,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio rei venditae et traditae</span><span class="font1"> or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio non numeratae&nbsp;pecuniae</span><span class="font1"> should have been found necessary—the one an answer&nbsp;to a vendor (with the price in his pocket) who attempted to&nbsp;dispossess his vendee because some of the formalities of conveyance had been neglected, the other an answer to an action&nbsp;on a bond for repayment of money that by some accident&nbsp;had never been advanced—proves that the law had now to&nbsp;encounter fraud in all directions, and that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Graeca jides</span><span class="font1"> had tc&nbsp;a great extent displaced the old Roman probity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Factors of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legislation.—</span><span class="font1">It cannot be said that during the period of nearly two centuries and a half embraced within the present epoch the&nbsp;private law owed much to legislation. The vast majority&nbsp;of the enactments of the time referred to by the historians dealt with constitutional questions, municipal and&nbsp;colonial government, agrarian arrangements, fiscal policy, sumptuary&nbsp;prohibitions, criminal and police regulations, and other matters&nbsp;that affected the public law rather than the private.. Those of the&nbsp;latter class mentioned by Gaius and Ulpian in their institutional&nbsp;works barely exceed a score in number; and of these not above&nbsp;half a dozen can be said to have exercised a permanent influence&nbsp;on the principles (as distinguished from the details) of the law.&nbsp;Most of them were enactments of. the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis</span><span class="font1"> or of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of the tribes, to which ordinary legislation had passed as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">more readily convened and more easily worked than the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia </span><span class="font1">of the centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edicts of the Magistrates.<sup>@@3 </sup></span><span class="font1">The practice of propounding edicts was very ancient, and had been followed by kings and consuls long&nbsp;before the institution of the praetorship. It was one of&nbsp;the most obvious ways of exercising the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;which the supreme magistrate was invested—to lay an&nbsp;injunction upon a citizen and enforce his obedience, or to&nbsp;confer upon him some advantage and maintain him in its enjoyment.&nbsp;It was one of the ways in which public order was protected where&nbsp;there had been no invasion of wnat the law regarded as a right,&nbsp;and.where, consequently, there was no remedy by action. That the&nbsp;earlier edicts of trie praetors were of this character—issued, that is&nbsp;to say, with reference to particular cases, and.what afterwards came&nbsp;to be called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prout res incidit posita—</span><span class="font1">there is little&nbsp;reason to doubt. In time a new class of edicts.appeared which got&nbsp;the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta perpetua</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perpetuae jurisdictionis causa pro-posita)—</span><span class="font1">-announcements by the praetor, published on his album (as&nbsp;the white boards displayed for the purpose in the forum were called),&nbsp;of the remedy he would be prepared to grant on the application of&nbsp;any one alleging that the state of facts contemplated had arisen. The&nbsp;next year’s praetor was free to adopt the edicts of his predecessor&nbsp;or not; but it was usual for him to do so if they had tieen found&nbsp;beneficial in practice, he adding to them new provisions suggested&nbsp;by demands made upon past praetors for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina,</span><span class="font1"> but which&nbsp;tney had not generalized, or even proposing for acceptance some&nbsp;remedy entirely of his own devising. As each new praetor entered&nbsp;upon office he announced his jurisdictional programme—his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;annua,</span><span class="font1"> as it was called from this particular point of view, by far the&nbsp;greater part of it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tralaticium, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> transmitted from his predecessors,&nbsp;and only a few paragraphs, diminishing in number.as time progressed, representing his own contribution. And so it went on in&nbsp;the first years of the Empire, until the praetorian function was&nbsp;eclipsed by the imperial; and at last, after having, by instruction&nbsp;of Hadrian, been subjected to revision, and consolidated along with&nbsp;the Aedilian Edicts, by Salvius Julianus, it was, as will be noticed&nbsp;below, sanctioned as binding on the whole Empire. The term&nbsp;“ Edict ” is applied both to tne single edicts and also to the whole&nbsp;body of them together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is some reason for supposing that the edict attained considerable proportions in the time of Cicero; for he mentions that, whereas in his youth the XII. Tables had been taught to the boys&nbsp;in school, in his later years these were neglected, and young men&nbsp;directed instead to the praetor’s edicts for their first lessons in law.&nbsp;Of a few of them the date and authorship, are known with tolerable&nbsp;precision; but of the history of the majority, including some of the&nbsp;most important, such as those introducing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">restitutio in integrum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">on the ground of lesion through error, absence, minority ana the&nbsp;like, ana those revolutionizing the law of succession, we are to a&nbsp;great extent in the dark. It was one of the great advantages the&nbsp;edicts had over legislative enactments that they might be dropped,&nbsp;resumed or amended by a new praetor according to his judgment of&nbsp;public requirements. For the edict was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viva vox juris civilis—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">intended to aid, supplement and correct it in accordance with the&nbsp;ever-changing estimate of public necessities; and this would have&nbsp;been impossible had its provisions from the first been as stereotyped&nbsp;as they became by the consolidation in the time of Hadrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The edict seems to have contained two parts—the first what may be called the edicts proper, and the second styles of actions,&nbsp;&amp;c., whether derived from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> or from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus praetorium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The styles or formulae for civil actions were published without any&nbsp;corresponding edict; for praetorian actions styles were published&nbsp;appropriate to their corresponding edicts. There were also independent formulae for interdicts, processual stipulations, &amp;c. The&nbsp;contents of the edicts proper were in detail very various, but all&nbsp;devoted to an exposition of the ways in which the praetor meant to&nbsp;exercise his jurisdiction during his year of office. They were not&nbsp;didactic or dogmatic formulations of law, but rather announcements of what remedy he would grant in such and such circumstances,&nbsp;or direct orders to do or prohibitions against, doing certain things.&nbsp;A party claiming an action or whatever else it might be under any&nbsp;of them did so not of right, as he would have done had his claim&nbsp;had a statutory or customary foundation, but of grace—on the&nbsp;strength of the praetor’s promise to grant him what he claimed and&nbsp;make the grant effectual. That was why originally such an action&nbsp;had to be raised and concluded within the particular praetor’s year&nbsp;of office—a rule which in time, by abuse, was converted into the&nbsp;somewhat different one that a purely praetorian action </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font1"> not&nbsp;originally of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus. civile)</span><span class="font1"> had to be raised within a year of the&nbsp;occurrence to which it referred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As already observed, the praetor’s edicts proceeded upon lines of equity; that is to say, they were directed against the strictness&nbsp;and formalism of the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables. Such may&nbsp;be said to have been the general tendency of the edicts as a whole.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
