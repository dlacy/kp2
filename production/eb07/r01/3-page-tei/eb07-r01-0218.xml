A few common-place words of application would have wound up the discourse in the usual way ; and these accordingly Æs-chines does not fail to insert ; but not till, with the sound of his own magnificent exorcism still ringing in his ears, he has marred everything by a tragic invocation of the earth and the sun, and virtue, and intelligence, and instruction, conceived in the very worst taste of Euripides, all but non</p><p>sensical in itself, misplaced in any oration, and in this a most humiliating spectacle of incorrect judgment degrading and disarming genius.</p><p>Every one knows what was the issue of the contest.</p><p>Ctesiphon was acquitted ; and his accuser, having failed in gaining the number of votes which would have protected the charge from being considered frivolous and malicious, was fined, and compelled to go into exile. We do not possess such materials as enable us to judge of the relative strength of the two factions among the numerous judges who pronounced this decision ; but the splendid oration of Demosthenes for the defence, now perused by us under every possible disadvantage, would tempt us to believe that, in an audience so volatile and susceptible as the Athenians, who were confessedly on many occasions impelled hither and thither by the orators at their will, even party-spirit may for once have been compelled to deny its own nature, and to become silent and impartial.</p><p>The oration of Demosthenes, admirable though it be, will</p><p>not call for a more minute analysis than that of Æschines ; both because it is better known and more generally accessible, and because its strain may in part be anticipated from the outline which has just been given. Many of its most striking beauties we must pass unnoticed, and we can but indicate one or two others ; such as the skill of insinuation throughout, with which the orator endeavours at once to kindle the feelings of his own party, and to conciliate those of the other ; the frequent felicity of illustration, as where he compares Æschines to a physician, who, after having watched his patient through a long sickness, propounds his remedies for the first time on the day of the funeral ; the fine sketches of character, like that noble one of Philip, crippled in every member of his body, but unsubdued in mind, and burning with the love of power and honour.</p><p>The Exordium is exceedingly skilful. After briefly claiming credit for good will, the speaker protests, with a very well acted indignation, against the attempt of his adversary to bind him to a particular order of topics, which, he asserts, the judges cannot countenance without violating their oath and every principle of justice : he then, after adverting to his own disadvantages, declares with artful earnestness, that the turn which Æschines had given to the accusation had, as he now found, put the character of Demosthenes himself distinctly in issue, forcing him, whether he would or not, to defend the whole tenor of his public life : he asserts peremptorily, that if Æschines had confined himself to the matters really suggested by the articles of impeachment, he, in the defence, would have entered at once on the question of the legality of the decree, but that he was now obliged to follow a different course in order to dispel unfounded prejudices : and he closes his introduction by insinuations against the accuser, both for his long delay in bringing the charge, and for the form in which it was at length presented.</p><p>He commences the body of the oration by intimating his intention to answer specifically each article of the charge, after he shall have premised a general view of the state of affairs when he first entered on political life. We cannot follow him through the details by which he redeems, or seems to redeem, this promise ; but two or three points may be selected as prominently instructive. Indignant denials of unproved charges are thrown out at the very commencement, and accompanied by that overwhelming strength of recrimination which is exerted in almost every page of the whole speech : again and again, from the very opening of the argument, he protests that his line of reasoning had been forced on him by his adversary ; and not till after he had endeavoured to destroy the whole credit of the accuser, by repeated and detailed charges of gross dishonesty and corruption, does he venture to approach the articles Of impeachment themselves. At length he recites them, and enters on his answer ; but, protesting once more against the accuser’s tactics, he professes himself compelled to defend, in the first place, that part of the decree which sets forth his own character, which he vindicates by a long and animated history. He then, with a contemptuous negligence of expression, intimates that there seems to be no other task left him, than to prove the strict legality of the decree, in favour of which he delivers an argument extending to about one twentieth part of the whole discourse. On this point, which was the one formally at issue, his defence is as lame as can well be conceived : Æschines, indeed, by his arguments in anticipation, had beaten away from beneath his feet all the ground on which he could have hoped to stand : one such plea, however, from the existence of a contradictory law, he does plausibly support ; and one unanticipated ground which he urges, intended as a denial of the fact, proves, on close examination, to amount nearly to this, that although he had not accounted when the decree was passed, he had done so before the accusation was brought, and his accounts had not been challenged.</p><p>But the great orator, strong as was his faith in the legal inaptitude and factious prepossessions of the judges, dared not to close his case on such sophisms as this ; and accordingly, when he leaves the question as to the legality of the decree, never again to mention it, the oration is not quite half over. He immediately resumes his former detail of facts, grappling, however, more and more closely with Æschines, and following up every proof of his own patriotism and sagacity with a stinging contrast between his conduct and that of his enemy. Of the two points on which his argument was weakest, the one, his own personal courage, does not draw from him a single word ; but the other, the undeniable failure of the policy which he had advised, it behoved him to touch ; and as it was a matter in which, till some answer should be attempted, there might prevail in the minds of the audience a lurking conviction ruinous to Demosthenes and his cause, he summons up all his energies to dislodge the impression, introducing the subject boldly almost immediately after he had dismissed the legal argument, and disposing of it in one of his noblest appeals to national pride and the sense of honour. This magnificent passage of the speech is composed in the same lofty key in which we heard the orator closing the third Philippic : it rolls on in a mingled flood of rapid illustration, of proudly patriotic spirit, and of declarations of that love of freedom which must burn in Athens though all the world besides were dark ; and it is terminated by the tremendous oath, in which the brave who had died in battle for their country are called as witnesses to the truth of the principles which the speaker maintained. This most eloquent and celebrated passage is not an argument : it will bear no analysis as such ; but it is one of the most strongly felt and admirably wrought of all addresses to the feelings of national honour, pride, and independence.
