<p><span class="font3">properties of a crystal under the influence of homogeneous strain, the principal axes of the wave-surface being parallel to&nbsp;those of the strain, and the medium being uniaxal, if the strain&nbsp;be symmetrical. John Kerr also found that a dielectric under&nbsp;electric stress behaves as an uniaxal crystal with its optic axis&nbsp;parallel to the electric force, glass acting as a negative and&nbsp;bisulphide of carbon as a positive crystal (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Phil.

<p><span class="font3">Not content with determining the laws of double refraction, Fresnel also attempted to give their mechanical explanation.&nbsp;He supposed that the aether consists of a system of distinct&nbsp;material points symmetrically arranged and acting on one&nbsp;another by forces that depend for a given pair only on their&nbsp;distance. If in such a system a single molecule be displaced, the&nbsp;projection of the force of restitution on the direction of displacement&nbsp; is proportional to the inverse square of the parallel&nbsp;radius-vector of an eïlipsoid; and of all displacements that can&nbsp;occur in a given plane, only those in the direction of the axes of&nbsp;the parallel central section of the quadric develop forces whose&nbsp;projection on the plane is along the displacement. In undulations&nbsp;, however, we are concerned with the elastic forces due to&nbsp;relative displacements, and, accordingly, Fresnel assumed that&nbsp;the forces called into play during the propagation of a system of&nbsp;plane waves (of rectilinear transverse vibrations) differ from&nbsp;those developed by the parallel displacement of a single molecule&nbsp;only by a constant factor, independent of the plane of the wave.&nbsp;Next, regarding the aether as incompressible, he assumed that the&nbsp;components of the elastic forces parallel to the wave-front are&nbsp;alone operative, and finally, on the analogy of a stretched string,&nbsp;that the propagational speed of a plane wave of permanent&nbsp;type is proportional to the square root of the effective force&nbsp;developed by the vibrations. With these hypotheses we&nbsp;immediately obtain the laws of double refraction, as given by&nbsp;the ellipsoid of polarization, with the result that the vibrations&nbsp;are perpendicular to the plane of polarization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its dynamical foundations Fresnel’s theory, though of considerable historical interest, is clearly defective in rigour,&nbsp;and a strict treatment of the aether as a crystalline elastic solid&nbsp;does not lead naturally to Fresnel’s laws of double refraction.&nbsp;On the other hand, Lord Kelvin’s rotational aether </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Math, and&nbsp;Phys. Papers,</span><span class="font3"> iii. 442)—a medium that has no true rigidity&nbsp;but possesses a quasi-rigidity due to elastic resistance to absolute&nbsp;rotation—gives these laws at once, if we abolish the resistance&nbsp;to compression and, regarding it as gyrostatically isotropic,&nbsp;attribute to it aeolotropic inertia. The equations then obtained&nbsp;are the same as those deduced in the electro-magnetic theory from&nbsp;the circuital laws of A. M. Ampère and Michael Faraday, when&nbsp;the specific inductive capacity is supposed aeolotropic. In&nbsp;order to account for dispersion, it is necessary to take into&nbsp;account the interaction with the radiation of the intra-molecular&nbsp;vibrations of the crystalline substance: thus the total current&nbsp;on the electro-magnetic theory must be regarded as made up of&nbsp;the current of displacement and that due to the oscillations&nbsp;of the electrons within the molecules of the crystal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">III. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Astronomical Refraction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The refraction of a ray of light by the atmosphere as it passes from a heavenly body to an observer on the earth’s surface, is&nbsp;called “ astronomical.” A knowledge of its amount is a necessary&nbsp;datum in the exact determination of the direction of the body.&nbsp;In its investigation the fundamental hypothesis is that the strata&nbsp;of the air are in equilibrium, which implies that the surfaces of&nbsp;equal density are horizontal. But this condition is being&nbsp;continually disturbed by aerial currents, which produce continual&nbsp; slight fluctuations in the actual refraction, and commonly&nbsp;give to the image of a star a tremulous motion. Except for this&nbsp;slight motion the refraction is always in the vertical direction;&nbsp;that is, the actual zenith distance of the star is always greater&nbsp;than its apparent distance. The refracting power of the air is&nbsp;nearly proportional to its density. Consequently the amount&nbsp;of the refraction varies with the temperature and barometric&nbsp;pressure, being greater the higher the barometer and the lower&nbsp;the temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At moderate zenith distances, the amount of the refraction varies nearly as the tangent of the zenith distance. Under&nbsp;ordinary conditions of pressure and temperature it is, near the&nbsp;zenith, about 1</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font3"> for each degree of zenith distance. As the tangent&nbsp;increases at a greater rate than the angle, the increase of the&nbsp;refraction soon exceeds 1</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font3"> for each degree. At 45° from the&nbsp;zenith the tangent is 1 and the mean refraction is about 58</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font3">.&nbsp;As the horizon is approached the tangent increases more and&nbsp;more rapidly, becoming infinite at the horizon; but the re fraction&nbsp; now increases at a less rate, and, when the observed&nbsp;ray is horizontal, or when the object appears on the horizon, the&nbsp;refraction is about 34</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font3">, or a little greater than the diameter of&nbsp;the sun or moon. It follows that when either of these objects is&nbsp;seen on the horizon their actual direction is entirely below it.&nbsp;One result is that the length of the day is increased by refraction&nbsp;to the extent of about five minutes in low latitudes, and still&nbsp;more in higher latitudes. At 60° the increase is about nine&nbsp;minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The atmosphere, like every other transparent substance, refracts the blue rays of the spectrum more than the red ; consequently&nbsp;, when the image of a star near the horizon is observed&nbsp;with a telescope, it presents somewhat the appearance of a&nbsp;spectrum. The edge which is really highest, but seems lowest&nbsp;in the telescope, is blue, and the opposite one red. When the&nbsp;atmosphere is steady this atmospheric spectrum is very marked&nbsp;and renders an exact observation of the star difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography.—Refraction has been a favourite subject of research. See Dr. C. Bruhns, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die astronomische Strahlenbrechung&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Leipzig, 1861), gives a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">résumé</span><span class="font2"> of the various formulae of refraction&nbsp;which had been developed by the leading investigators up to the&nbsp;date 1861. Since then developments of the theory are found in:&nbsp;W. Chauvenet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spherical and Practical Astronomy,</span><span class="font2"> i.; F. Brünnow,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphärischen Astronomie;</span><span class="font2"> S. Newcomb, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spherical Astronomy;</span><span class="font2"> R.&nbsp;Radau, “Recherches sur la théorie des réfractions astronomiques”&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Annales de l'observatoire de Paris,</span><span class="font2"> xvi., 1882), “ Essai sur les réfractions astronomiques ” (ibid., xix., 1889).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the tables of refraction which have been most used are Bessel’s, derived from the observations  of Bradley in Bessel’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fundamenta Astronomiae;</span><span class="font2"> and Bessel’s revised tables in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tabidae&nbsp;Regiomontanae,</span><span class="font2"> in which, however, the constant is too large, but&nbsp;which in an expanded form were mostly used at the observatories&nbsp;until 1870. The constant use of the Poulkova tables, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tabulae refractionum,</span><span class="font2"> which is reduced to nearly its true value, has gradually&nbsp;replaced that of Bessel. Later tables are those of L. de Ball,&nbsp;published at Leipzig in 1906.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(S. N.)</span></p>
