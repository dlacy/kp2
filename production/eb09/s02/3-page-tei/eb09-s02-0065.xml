It is important to</p><p>note that Ambrogio</p><p>and probably other</p><p>painters of his time</p><p>were, like the ear</p><p>lier Pisan Niccola,</p><p>beginning to study</p><p>the then rare ex</p><p>amples of classical</p><p>sculpture.

Sodoma, though he settled in Siena in 1501, does not belong to the school of Siena ; his early life was passed at Milan, chiefly under the influence of Da Vinci. His talent was developed at Rome among the followers of Raphael.</p><p>On the whole the Florentine school surpasses in importance all others throughout Italy.

Orcagna alone developed rather a different line, more richly decorative in style and brighter in colour,â€” a link between the art of Giotto and that of Siena. In the 15th century Florence reached its period of highest artistic splendour and developed an almost</p></body></text></TEI>
