<p><span class="font0">of Germany, and when the treaty of Skierniewice expired in 1887 he declined to renew it. From that time Russia gravitated&nbsp;slowly towards an alliance with France, and sought to create&nbsp;a counterpoise against the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria&nbsp;and Italy. The tsar was reluctant to bind himself by a formal&nbsp;treaty, because the French government did not offer the requisite guarantees of stability, and because he feared that it&nbsp;might be induced, by the prospect of Russian support, to assume&nbsp;an aggressive attitude towards Germany. He recognized,&nbsp;however, that in the event of a great European war the two&nbsp;nations would in all probability be found fighting on the same&nbsp;side, and that if they made no preparations for concerted military&nbsp;action they would be placed at a grave disadvantage in comparison with their opponents of the Triple Alliance, who were&nbsp;believed to have already worked out an elaborate plan of&nbsp;campaign. In view of this contingency the Russian and French&nbsp;military authorities studied the military questions in common,&nbsp;and the result of their labours was the preparation of a military&nbsp;convention, which was finally ratified in 1894. During this&nbsp;period the relations between the two governments and the&nbsp;two countries became much more cordial. In the summer of&nbsp;1891 the visit to Kronstadt of a French squadron under Admiral&nbsp;Gervais was made the occasion for an enthusiastic demonstration&nbsp;in favour of a Franco-Russian alliance; and two years later&nbsp;(October 1893) a still more enthusiastic reception was given to&nbsp;the Russian Admiral Avclan and his officers when they visited&nbsp;Toulon and Paris. But it was not till after the death of Alexander III. that the word “ alliance ” was used publicly by&nbsp;official personages. In 1895 the term was first publicly employed by M. Ribot, then president of the council, in the Chamber&nbsp;of Deputies, but the expressions he used were so vague that they&nbsp;did not entirely remove the prevailing doubts as to the existence of a formal treaty. Two years later (August 1897), during&nbsp;the official visit of M. Félix Faure to St Petersburg, a little&nbsp;more light was thrown on the subject. In the complimentary&nbsp;speeches delivered by the president of the French Republic and&nbsp;the tsar, France and Russia were referred to as allies, and the&nbsp;term “ nations alliées ” was afterwards repeatedly used on&nbsp;occasions of a similar kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In south-eastern Europe Alexander III. adopted an attitude of reserve and expectancy. He greatly increased and strengthened his Black Sea fleet, so as to be ready for any emergency&nbsp;that might arise, and in June 1886, contrary to the declaration&nbsp;made in the Treaty of Berlin (Art. 59), he ordered Batum to be&nbsp;transformed into a fortified naval port, but in the Balkan Peninsula he persistently refrained, under a good deal of provocation, from any inteivention that might lead to a European&nbsp;war. The Bulgarian government, first under Prince Alexander&nbsp;and afterwards under the direction of M. Stamboloff, pursued&nbsp;systematically an anti-Russian policy, but the cabinet of St&nbsp;Petersburg confined itself officially to breaking off diplomatic&nbsp;relations and making diplomatic protests, and unofficially to&nbsp;giving tacit encouragement to revolutionary agitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Asia, during the reign of Alexander III. the expansion of Russian domination made considerable progress. A few weeks&nbsp;after his accession he sanctioned the annexation of the territory&nbsp;of the Tekke Turkomans, which had been conquered by General&nbsp;Skobelev, and in 1884 he formally annexed the Merv oasis without&nbsp;military operations. He then allowed the military authorities&nbsp;to push forward in the direction of Afghanistan, until in March&nbsp;1885 an engagement took place between Russian and Afghan&nbsp;forces at Panjdeh. Thereupon the British government, which&nbsp;had been for some time carrying on negotiations with the&nbsp;cabinet of St Petersburg for a delimitation of the Russo-Afghan&nbsp;frontier, intervened energetically and prepared for war; but a&nbsp;compromise was effected, and after more than two years of&nbsp;negotiation a delimitation convention was signed at St Petersburg on 20th July 1887. The forward movement of Russia&nbsp;was thus stopped in the direction of Herat, but it continued&nbsp;with great activity farther east in the region of the Pamirs,&nbsp;until another Anglo-Russian convention was signed in 1895.&nbsp;During the whole reign of Alexander III. the increase of territory in Central Asia is calculated by Russian authorities at&nbsp;429,895 square kilometres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On ist November 1894 Alexander III. died, and was succeeded by his son, Nicholas II., who, partly from similarity of character&nbsp;and partly from veneration for his father’s memory,&nbsp;continued the existing lines of policy in home and&nbsp;foreign affairs. The expectation entertained in many&nbsp;quarters that great legislative changes would at once&nbsp;be made in a liberal sense was not realized. When&nbsp;an influential deputation from the province of Tver,&nbsp;which had long enjoyed a reputation for liberalism, ventured to&nbsp;hint in a loyal address that the time had come for changes&nbsp;in the existing autocratic regime, they received a reply&nbsp;which showed that the emperor had no intention of making&nbsp;any such changes. Private suggestions in the same sense,&nbsp;offered directly and respectfully, were no better received, and&nbsp;no important changes were made in the legislation of the preceding reign. But a great alteration took place noiselessly in&nbsp;the manner of carrying out the laws and ministerial circulars.&nbsp;Though resembling his father in the main points of his character,&nbsp;the young tsar was of a more humane disposition^ and he was&nbsp;much less of a doctrinaire. With his father’s aspiration of&nbsp;making Holy Russia a homogeneous empire he thoroughly&nbsp;sympathized in principle, but he disliked the systematic persecution of Jews, heretics and schismatics to which it gave rise,&nbsp;and he let it be understood, without any formal order or proclamation, that the severe measures hitherto employed would&nbsp;not meet with his approval. The officials were not slow to take&nbsp;the hint, and their undue zeal at once disappeared. Nicholas II.&nbsp;showed, however, that his father’s policy of Russification was&nbsp;neither to be reversed nor to be abandoned. When an influential deputation was sent from Finland to St Petersburg to&nbsp;represent to him respectfully that the officials were infringing&nbsp;the local rights and privileges solemnly accorded at the time of&nbsp;the annexation, it was refused an audience, and the leaders of&nbsp;the movement were informed indirectly that local interests&nbsp;must be subordinated to the general welfare of the empire. In&nbsp;accordance with this declaration, the policy of Russification in&nbsp;Finland was steadily maintained, and caused much disappointment, not only to the Finlanders, but also to the other nationalities who desired the preservation of their ancient rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In foreign affairs Nicholas II. likewise continued the policy of his predecessor, with certain modifications suggested by the&nbsp;change of circumstances. He strengthened the cordial understanding with France by a formal agreement, the terms of which&nbsp;were not divulged, but he never encouraged the French government in any aggressive designs, and he maintained friendly&nbsp;relations with Germany. In the Balkan Peninsula a slight&nbsp;change of attitude took place. Alexander III., indignant at&nbsp;what he considered the ingratitude of the Slav nationalities,&nbsp;remained coldly aloof, as far as possible, from all intervention&nbsp;in their affairs. About three months after his death, de Giers,&nbsp;who thoroughly approved of this attitude, died (26th January&nbsp;1895), and his successor, Prince Lobanov, minister of foreign&nbsp;affairs from 19th March 1895 to 30th August 1896, endeavoured&nbsp;to recover what he considered Russia’s legitimate influence&nbsp;in the Slav world. For this purpose Russian diplomacy became&nbsp;more active in south-eastern Europe. The result was perceived&nbsp;first in Montenegro and Servia, and then in Bulgaria. Prince&nbsp;Ferdinand of Bulgaria had long been anxious to legalize his&nbsp;position by a reconciliation, and as soon as he got rid of Stamboloff he made advances to the Russian government. They&nbsp;were well received, and a reconciliation was effected on certain&nbsp;conditions, the first of which was that Prince Ferdinand’s eldest&nbsp;son and heir should become a member of the Eastern Orthodox&nbsp;Church. As another means of opposing Western influence in&nbsp;south-eastern Europe, Prince Lobanov inclined to the policy of&nbsp;protecting rather than weakening the Ottoman empire. When&nbsp;the British government seemed disposed to use coercive measures for the protection of the Armenians, he gave it clearly to&nbsp;be understood that any such proceeding would be opposed by&nbsp;Russia. After Prince Lobanov’s death and the appointment</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
