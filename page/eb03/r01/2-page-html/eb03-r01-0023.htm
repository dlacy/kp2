<p><span class="font0">his mother coald not bear the expence oſ a regular edu-cation in either of the univerſities of oxford or Cam-bridge, which he doubtleſs thought abſolutely neceffary to one who aſpired to reſpectability in the church of&nbsp;England. Yielding therefore to neceſſity, he reſolved&nbsp;to ſtudy ſurgery and pharmacy ; and was with this vicw&nbsp;bound apprentice to Dr Findlay, a phyſician (a) in Fra-ſerſhurgh. But though obliged to relinquiſh for a time&nbsp;his favourite ſtudies, he did not think ignorance excu-ſable in a ſurgeon more than in a clergyman, or conceive&nbsp;that he could ever.become eminent in the profeſſion in&nbsp;which circumſtances had placed him, merely by ſkill in&nbsp;ſetting a bone or compounding a medicine. He deter-mined therefore, with the full approbation of his maſter,&nbsp;who very ſoon diſcovered his talents for literature, to&nbsp;make himſelf acquainted with at leaſt the outlines of the&nbsp;liberal arts and fcicnces ; and with this view he repaired&nbsp;in 1750 to the King’s College and univerſity of Aberdeen, where he obtained one of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">burſaries</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exhibitions</span><span class="font0"> which are there annually beſtowed upon ſuch can-didates for them as diſplay the ſhoſt accurate knowledge&nbsp;of the Latin language. The ſmall ſum of five pounds,&nbsp;however (which none of theſe burſaries exceed), was&nbsp;ſtill inadequate to the expence of reſidence in college ;&nbsp;but our young ſtudent was ſoon to obtain a more valu-âble exhibition, and to obtain it likewiſe by his own&nbsp;merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the long vacation he returned to his maſter Dr Findlay, and was by him intruſted with a very deſpe-rate caſe in ſurgery, of which his management may be&nbsp;Laid to have laid the foundation of his future fortunes.&nbsp;A female fervant of one of the judges of the Court of&nbsp;Seffion, who, when the court was not fitting, reſided in&nbsp;the neighbourhood of Fraſerſhurgh, had been ſo dread-fully gored by a bull, that hardly any hopes werc enter-ſtained of her recovery; but Mr Ramſay, to whoſe care&nbsp;ſhe was entirely leſt, treated the wound with ſuch ſkil-ful attention, that, contrary to general expectation, his&nbsp;patient recovered. This attracted the judge’s notice,&nbsp;who having informed himſelf of the young man’s cir-eumſtances and character, recommended him ſo effec-tually to Sir Alexander Ramſay of Balmain, that he&nbsp;j&gt;refented him with a burfary of 15 pounds a-year, which&nbsp;commenced at the next </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fejfioη</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">term,</span><span class="font0"> in the fame college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He now profecuted his ſtudies with comfort ; and thougſh he was detained in college a year longer than is&nbsp;uſual, being obliged, upon his acceptance of a ſecond&nbsp;burſary, to begin his courſe anew, he always conſidered&nbsp;this as a fortunate circumſtance, becauſe it gave him&nbsp;the celebrated Dr Reid three years for his preceptor.&nbsp;To that great and amiable philoſopher he fo recom-mended himſelf by his talents, his induſtry, and his vir-tues, that he was honoured with his friendſhip to the&nbsp;day of his death. Nor was it only to his maſters that&nbsp;his conduct recommended him ; Sir Alexander Ramſay,&nbsp;whom he viſited during fome of the vacations, was ſo&nbsp;Well pleaſed with his conversation, that he promiſed him</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">another burſary, in his gift, of 251. a-year, to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">com. </span><span class="font0">ιnence immediately on the expiration of that which he&nbsp;enjoyed. This promiſe hc performed in the beginning&nbsp;of the year 1755 ; and at the ſolicitation of Dr Findlay&nbsp;even paid the money per advance to enable the cxhibi-tioner to travel for the purpoſe of improving himſelf in&nbsp;his profeſſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus provided, Mr Ramſay went to London, and ſtu-died ſurgery and pharmacy under the auſpices of Dr Macauly ; in whoſe family he lived ſor two years, careſſed&nbsp;and eſteemed both by him and by his lady. Afterwards,&nbsp;having paſſed the uſual examination at Surgeon’s-hall,&nbsp;he ſerved in his medical capacity for ſeveral years in the&nbsp;royal navy; but how long he was continued in the ſtation&nbsp;of a mate, or when and by whom he was firſt appoint-ed furgeon, we have not been able to learn. We can&nbsp;ſay, however,* upon the beſt authority, that by his humane and diligent diſcharge of his duty in either ſtation,&nbsp;he endeared himſelf to the ſeamen, and acquired the e-ſteem of his officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of his humanity there is indeed one memorable in-ſtance, which muſt not be omitted, whilſt he acted as ſurgeon of the Arundel, then commanded by Captain&nbsp;(now vice-admiral Sir Charles) Middleton, a ſlave-ſhip&nbsp;on her paſſage from Africa to the weſt Indies fell </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with the fleet to which the Arundel belonged. An&nbsp;epidemical diſtemper, too common in ſuch veſſels, had&nbsp;fwept away not only a great number of the unfortunate&nbsp;negroes, but alſo many of the ſhip’s crew, and among&nbsp;others the ſurgeon. In this diſtreſſed ſituation the&nbsp;commander of the Guinea ſhip applied to the Engliſh&nbsp;Commodore for medical aſſiſtance ; but not a ſurgeon or&nbsp;ſurgeon’s mate in the whole fleet, except Mr Ramſay,&nbsp;would expoſe himſelf to the contagion of fo dangerous&nbsp;a diſtemper. Prompted, however, by his own innate&nbsp;benevolence, and fully authorized by his no leſs bene-volent commander, the ſurgeon of the Arundel, regard-leſs of perſonal danger, and truſting in that God to&nbsp;whom mercy is more acceptable than ſacrifice, went on&nbsp;board the infected ſhip, viſited all the patients, and re-mained long enough to leave behind him written direc∙&nbsp;tions for their future treatment. If a cup of cold water&nbsp;given in charity be entitled to a reward, how much&nbsp;more ſuch an action as this ? But the rewards of Chriſtianity are not immediate. Mr Ramſay indeed eſcaped&nbsp;the contagion ; but on his return to his own ſhip, juſt&nbsp;as ſhe had got on the deck, he fell and broke his thighbone ; by which he was confined to his apartment for&nbsp;ten months, and rendered in a ſmall degree lame through&nbsp;the remainder of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fearleſs humanity which he diſplayed on this occaſion gained him the 'friendſhip and eſteem of Sir&nbsp;Charles Middleton, which no future action of his life&nbsp;had the ſmalleſt tendency to impair ; but the fracture&nbsp;of his thigh-bone and his ſubſequent lameneſs determin.&nbsp;ed him to quit the navy, and once more turn hie&nbsp;thoughts towards the church. Accordingly, while the&nbsp;Arundel lay at St Chriſtopher’s, he opened his views to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
