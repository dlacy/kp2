This is the moſt eligible manner of opening theſe cavities, and gives an opportunity of ſewing them up with a better appearance for any person’s view afterwards.  That kind of ſtitch called by ſempſtreſſes the <hi rend="italic">herring-bone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flat ſeam</hi> has a very pretty and neat effect upon theſe occasions.</p><p>If it is propoſed to take out the thoracic and abdominal viſcera together, for further examination, the diaphragm is firſt to be cut down to the ſpine on both ſides ; then, to avoid being incommoded with blood, &amp;c. two very ſtrong ligatures are to be paſſed round the œsophagus and large blood-veſſels, in which the trachea may be included ; tying them ſtrait, and then dividing theſe parts between the ligatures : the ſame meaſures are to be taken in reſpect to the inferior vessels upon the lumbar region, a little above the bifurcation of the aorta, including the vena cava ; and alſo upon the rectum. After having obſerved theſe precautions, the viſcera, with the diaphragm, are to be removed by a wary diſſection, all the way cloſe to the ſpine ; and by gently drawing them at the ſame time, the ſeparation will be greatly facilitated.</p><p>When the thoracic and abdominal viſcera are to be taken out ſeparately, in the firſt caſe ligatures muſt be made, as have been deſcribed upon the veſſels, &amp;c. juſt above the diaphragm, and in the other juſt below it, and upon the rectum.</p><p>Should we be called upon to perform this office when the body is become very putrid, it will be absolutely neceſſary to have ſuch parts of it well waſhed with warm vinegar and brandy, and then ſprinkled with lavender-water or ſome ſuch odoriferous antiputreſcent liquor, before the examination, in order to correct the stench, and defend us againſt the noxious quality of the effluvia ; a precaution, the neglect of which may be attended with very direful effects.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVIII. <hi rend="italic">Of Embalming dead Bodies.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">in</hi> the early ages of the world, the practice of embalming dead bodies was very common, particularly among the Egyptians ;. but it has long been diſuſed in almoſt all countries, except for great perſonages. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Embalming.</hi> The following directions are taken from Mr Gooch, to whom they were communicated by a person of great character, and well acquainted with the modern practice of embalming in this kingdom.</p><p>After eviſceration, as has been directed in opening a dead body, and continuing the inciſion farther upwards, even into the mouth, and, if practicable, without cutting the ſkin of the neck, all the cavities are to be well cleanſed, and the humidity ſucked up with ſponges, then waſhed with <hi rend="italic">tinct. myrrhae,</hi> and filled with a ſpecies compounded of fragrant herbs, aromatic drugs, and gums reduced to powder not very fine, firſt reſtoring the heart to its former reſidence, after having opened its ventricles, cleanſed and waſhed them with the tincture, stuffed them with the ſpices, and ſewed them up ; and then the cavities are to be ſtitched very cloſe with the glover’s or ſpiral future. Large and deep inciſions are alſo to be made in all the moſt fleſhy parts, cleaning and waſhing them with the tincture in the ſame manner, filling them with the antiſeptic ſpices, and ſtitching them up. Then the head, trunk, and limbs, are to be perfectly well covered with cerecloth ; putting a piece under the chin, to be ſecured by ſewing on the top of the head, after having well adjuſted the cap of the ſkull, ſewed the ſcalp together, and cleaned the mouth, as has been directed for the other parts, and putting in ſome of the ſpices. The cerecloth is to be prepared, according to art, with a compoſition made of wax, rofin, ſtorax, and painter’s drying oil. After the application of the cerecloth, with great care and exactness, cut into ſuitable pieces according to the reſpective parts, and cloſing them well everywhere, the face being cloſe ſhaved, is to be covered with ſome of the above compoſition melted, and laid on with a bruſh of a proper degree of heat, and of a moderate thickneſs ; which may have a faint fleſh- colour given it with vermilion ; and when it is grown cold and stiff upon this part, it may be lightly covered with hard varniſh ; or this varniſh, applied thick, may here ſerve the purpoſe alone. A cap is to be well adapted to the head, falling down upon the neck, and to be sewed under the chin, making a few circular turns about the neck with a roller of a proper breadth. All the reſt of the corpſe is to be incloſed in a ſheet, to be artfully cut, and ſewed on very cloſe and ſmooth, with the fineſt tape, and the <hi rend="italic">flat seam</hi> mentioned in the preceding chapter ; over which an appropriate dress is to be put, as the relations or friends think fit to direct and appoint, and then laid into the coffin, which ſhould be in readineſs : but when it is ſome great perſonage, who is to lie in ſtate for public view before the funeral rites are ſolemnized, the dress muſt be appropriated to his dignity and character. The brain and other viſcera are to be put with ſome of the ſpices into a leaden box. Sometimes the heart, prepared as has been directed, to preſerve it from putrefaction, is depoſited in an urn by itſelf.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Explanation</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> CCCCLXXXVII.
