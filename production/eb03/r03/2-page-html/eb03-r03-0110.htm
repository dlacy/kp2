<p><span class="font0">View oſ </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">Tragedies of the laſt Age, and afterwards publiſhed a tragedy named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Edgar.</span><span class="font0"> For a critic he&nbsp;was certainly not well qualified, for he wanted candour ;&nbsp;nor is his judgment much to be relied on, who could&nbsp;condemn Shakeſpeare with ſuch rigid ſeverity. His&nbsp;tragedy will ſhow, that his talents for poetry were by&nbsp;no means equal to thoſe whoſe poems he has publicly&nbsp;•cenſured. But though he has no title to the appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">poet</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">critic,</span><span class="font0"> as an antiquarian and hiſtorian his&nbsp;memory will long be preſerved. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Faedera,</span><span class="font0"> which is&nbsp;a collection of all the public tranſactions, treaties, &amp;c.&nbsp;of the kings of England with foreign princes, is eſteemed one of our moſt authentic and valuable records, and&nbsp;is oftener referred to- by the beſt Engliſh hiſtorians than&nbsp;perhaps any other book in the language. It was publiſhed at London in the beginning of the preſent century in 17 volumes folio. Three volumes more were&nbsp;added by Sanderſen after Rymer’s death. The whole&nbsp;were reprinted at the Hague in 10 vols in 1739. They&nbsp;were abridged by Rapin in French, and inſerted in Le&nbsp;Clerc’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque,</span><span class="font0"> a tranſlation of which was made by&nbsp;Stephen Whatley, and printed in 4 vols 8vo, 1731.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rymer died 1 4th December 1713, and was buried in the pariſh church of St Clement’s Danes. Some&nbsp;ſpecimens of his poetry are preſerved in the ſirſt volume&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">•of </span><span class="font0">Mr NichoΓs Select Collection of Miſcellaneous Poems,&nbsp;1780.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYNCHOPS, in ornithology, a genus belonging to the order of anſeres. The bill is ſtraight ; and the ſuperior mandible much ſhorter than the inferior, which is&nbsp;truncated at the po⅛t. The ſpecies are two, viz. the&nbsp;nigra and fulva, both natives of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYOTS, in the policy of Kindoſtan, the modern name by which the renters of land are diſtinguiſhed.&nbsp;They hold their poſſeſſions by a leaſe, which may be&nbsp;■conſidered as perpetual, and at a rate fixed by ancient&nbsp;ſurveys and valuations. This arrangement hâs been </span><span class="font1">ſo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">long eſtabliſhed, and accords ſo well with the ideas of&nbsp;the natives, concerning the diſtinction of caſts, and the&nbsp;fonctions allotted to each, that it has been invariably&nbsp;maintained in all the provinces ſubject either to Mahometans or Europeans ; and to both it ſerves as the ba-ſis on which their whole ſyſtem ot finance is founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reſpecting the preciſe mode, however, in which the ryots of Hindoſtan held their poſſeſſions, there is much&nbsp;diverſity of opinion ; the chief of which are very impartially delineated in note iv. to the Appendix ol Ro-bertſon’s Hiſtorical Diſquiſition, &amp;c. concerning India·,&nbsp;p. 347. to which we refer ſuch of our readers as are in-tereſted in this ſubject of finance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYSCHIA, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants ;&nbsp;and in the natural method ranking with thoſe that are&nbsp;doubtful. The calyx is pentaphyllous ; the corolla is&nbsp;pentapetalous ; and the apices turned back, about three&nbsp;times the length of the calyx ; the filaments are five»&nbsp;awl-ſhaped, and ſhorter than the petals. The ſeed-veſſel is quadrilocular, and contains many ſeeds. Of this&nbsp;there are two ſpecies, viz. the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Claujiſolia</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sou-roubea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYSWICK, a large village in Holland, ſeated between the Hague and Delft, where the prince of O-range has a palace, which ſtands about a quarter of a mile farther. It is a very noble ſtructure, all of hewn&nbsp;ſtone, of great extent in front, but perhaps not propor-tionably high. It is adorned with a marble ltair-caſe,&nbsp;marble floors, and a magnificent terrace. There is a&nbsp;good proſpect of it from the canal between Delft and&nbsp;the Hague. This place is remarkable for a treaty concluded here in 1697 between England, Germany, Holland, France, and Spain. E. Long. 4. 20. N. Lat<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>52. 8.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
