Pop. (1900), 6383; area, 40 sq. m. St Mary is the southernmost and easternmost of the Azores, lying south of the larger island of St Michaelâ€™s, through the medium of which its trade is conducted, as it has no good harbours of its own. It produces wheat in abundance, of which a considerable quantity is exported. Various volcanic rocks arc the predominant formations, but beds of limestone also occur, giving rise to numerous stalactite grottoes all over the island. The chief town is Villa do Porto (2506).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
