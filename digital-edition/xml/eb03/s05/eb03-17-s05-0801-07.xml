a province of Germany, in the circle of Auſtria, with the title of a duchy. It is bounded on the north by the archduchy of Ayſtria, on the eaſt by Hungary, on the ſouth by Carmola, and on the west by Carinthia and the archbiſhopric of Saltſburg ; being 125 miles in length and 17 in breadth. It is ſaid to contain 22 cities, 95 towns, 338 caſtles, 15 convents, and 200,000 inhabitants. Though it is a mountainous country, yet there is a great deal of land fit for tillage, and the ſoil is ſo good, that the inhabitants never were in want of corn. It contains mines ot very good iron ; whence the arms made there are in great eſteem. The women differ greatly from the Auſtrians, and are very plain and downright, They have all swellings on their throats, called <hi rend="italic">bronchoceles.</hi> The men are also very simple, and are very zealous worſhippers of the Virgin Mary, They delight to sit at home in the chimney- corner, never troubling their heads about foreign affairs. The chief town is Gratz.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
