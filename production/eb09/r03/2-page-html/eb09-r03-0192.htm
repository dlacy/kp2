<p><span class="font1">though unequal, is in parts very fine. Rotrou’s death and its circumstances are known to many who never read&nbsp;a line of his plays. He was in Paris when the plague&nbsp;broke out at Dreux; the mayor fled, and all was confusion. Rotrou, reversing the conduct of Montaigne in&nbsp;somewhat similar circumstances, at once went to his post,&nbsp;caught the disease, and died in a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rotrou’s great fertility (he has left thirty-five collected plays besides others lost, strayed, or uncollected), and&nbsp;perhaps the uncertainty of dramatic plan shown by his&nbsp;hesitation almost to the last between the classical and&nbsp;the romantic style, have injured his work. He has no&nbsp;thoroughly good play, hardly one thoroughly good act.&nbsp;But his situations are often pathetic and noble, and as a&nbsp;tragic poet properly so called he is at his best almost the&nbsp;equal of Corneille and perhaps the superior of Racine.&nbsp;His single lines and single phrases have a brilliancy and&nbsp;force not to be found in French drama between Corneille&nbsp;and Hugo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A complete edition of Rotron was edited in five volumes by Viollet Ie Due in 1820. In 1882 M. de Ronehaud published a&nbsp;handsome edition of six plays—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Genest, VenxeslosHon Bertrand&nbsp;de Cabrcre, Antigone, Hercule Mourant,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cosroes,—</span><span class="font0">the latter&nbsp;Rotrou’s last play and a remarkable one. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Venceslas</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saint&nbsp;Genest</span><span class="font0"> are also to be found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chxfs-di œuvre Tragiques</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;Collection Didot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROTTERDAM, a city of the Netherlands in the province of South Holland, situated in 51“ 55' 19'' N. lat. and 4&quot; 29' 7&quot; E. long., on the right bank of the Nieuwe&nbsp;Maas at the point where it is joined by the Rotte, a small</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">stream rising near Moerkapelle. By rail it is 14 J miles south-east of The Hague and 44⅜ south of Amsterdam.&nbsp;As defined by its 17th-century fortifications the town was&nbsp;an isosceles triangle with a base of I^ miles along the&nbsp;river, but in modern times it has spread out in all directions beyond the limits of its own commune (which was&nbsp;increased in 1869 by the island of Fijenoord and part of&nbsp;the south bank of the river) into those of Delfshaven,&nbsp;Kralingen, and Hillegersberg. A huge dyke on which&nbsp;stands Hoog Straat or High Street divides the triangular&nbsp;portion into nearly equal parts—the inner and the outer&nbsp;town ; and the latter is cut up into a series of peninsulas&nbsp;and islands by the admirable system of harbours to which&nbsp;Rotterdam owes so much of its prosperity. The central&nbsp;part of the river frontage is lined by a broad quay called the&nbsp;Boompjes from the trees with which it is planted. From&nbsp;the apex of the triangle the town is bisected by a great&nbsp;railway viaduct (erected about 1870, and mainly constructed of iron), which is continued across the river to&nbsp;Fijenoord and the south bank by a bridge on a similarly&nbsp;grand scale, the line being the Great Southern Railway&nbsp;which connects Belgium and Holland and crosses the&nbsp;Hollandsch Diep by the Moerdijk bridge. Parallel with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the railwaybridge the municipality, in 1873, built a road-bridge, and apart from tbeir ordinary function these constructions have proved a sufficient barrier to prevent the ice-blocks of the upper part of the river from descending&nbsp;so as to interfere with the seaward navigation. Tramways, introduced in 1880, are being gradually extended&nbsp;to various suburbs. While some nine or ten Protestant&nbsp;sects, the Roman Catholics, the Old Roman Catholics,&nbsp;and the Jews are all represented in Rotterdam, none of&nbsp;the ecclesiastical buildings are of primary architectural&nbsp;interest. The Groote Kerk or Laurenskerk is a Gothic&nbsp;brick structure of the fifteenth century with a tower 297&nbsp;feet high ; it has a fine rood screen and an excellent&nbsp;organ, and contains the monuments of Lambert Hendriks-zoon, Egbert Meeuweszoon Kortenaar, Witte Corneliszoon&nbsp;de Witt, Johan van Brakel, Johan van Liefde, and other&nbsp;Dutch naval heroes. Among the more conspicuous secular&nbsp;buildings are the Boymans Museum, the town-house&nbsp;(restored in 1823-1827), the exchange (1723), the Delft&nbsp;Gate (1766), the court-house, the post and telegraph office&nbsp;(1875), the corn exchange, the seamen’s home (1855), the&nbsp;hospital (1846), and the theatres. The Boymans AIuseum&nbsp;is mainly a picture gallery, which became the property of&nbsp;the town in 1847. When the building, originally erected&nbsp;in 1662-63 as the assembly house of Schieland, was&nbsp;burned down in 1864, most of the pictures perished, but&nbsp;the museum was restored by 1867, and the collection,&nbsp;steadily recruited, is again rich in the works of Dutch&nbsp;artists. The ground floor also contains the city archives&nbsp;and the city library. The maritime museum, established&nbsp;in 1874 by the Yacht Club, is a remarkable collection of&nbsp;ship models, and the Society of Experimental Philosophy&nbsp;has a considerable collection of instruments, books, and&nbsp;specimens. At the north-west corner of the town an area&nbsp;of several acres is occupied by the zoological garden, which&nbsp;dates from 1857. Besides the Erasmus Gymnasium the</span></p>
