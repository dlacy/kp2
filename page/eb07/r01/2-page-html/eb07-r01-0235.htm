<p><span class="font0">the mountains bounding India to the north and China to the west, often swell those rivers to a prodigious height,&nbsp;though not a drop should have fallen on the plains through&nbsp;which they afterwards flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ After the mud has lain some days upon the plains in China, preparations are made for planting them with rice.&nbsp;For this purpose a small piece of ground is enclosed by a&nbsp;bank of clay ; the earth is ploughed up ; and an upright&nbsp;harrow, with a row of wooden pins in the lower end, is&nbsp;drawn lightly over it by a buffalo. The grain, which had&nbsp;previously been steeped in dung diluted with animal water,&nbsp;is then sown very thickly upon it. A thin sheet of water&nbsp;is immediately brought over it, either by channels leading&nbsp;to the spot from a source above it, or, when below it, by&nbsp;means of a chain-pump, of which the use is as familiar as&nbsp;that of a hoe to every Chinese husbandman. In a few days&nbsp;the remainder of the ground intended for cultivation, if&nbsp;stiff, is ploughed, the lumps broken by hoes, and the surface levelled by the harrow. As soon as the shoots have&nbsp;attained the height of six or seven inches, they are plucked&nbsp;up by the roots, the tops of the blades cut off, and each&nbsp;root is planted separately, sometimes in small furrows turned with the plough, and sometimes in holes made in rows&nbsp;by a drilling stick for that purpose. The roots are about&nbsp;half a foot asunder. Water is brought over them a second&nbsp;time. For the convenience of irrigation, and to regulate&nbsp;its proportion, the rice-fields are subdivided by narrow&nbsp;ridges of clay into small enclosures. Through a channel in&nbsp;each ridge the water is conveyed at will to every subdivision of the field. As the rice approaches to maturity, the&nbsp;water, by evaporation and absorption, disappears entirely ;&nbsp;and the crop, when ripe, covers dry ground. The first crop&nbsp;or harvest, in the southern provinces particularly, happens&nbsp;towards the end of May or beginning of June. The instrument for reaping is a small sickle, dentated like a saw,&nbsp;and crooked. Neither carts nor cattle are used to carry&nbsp;the sheaves off from the spot where they were reaped ; but&nbsp;they are placed regularly in frames, two of which, suspended at the extremities of a bamboo pole, are carried across&nbsp;the shoulders of a man, to the place intended for disengaging the grain from the stems which had supported it.&nbsp;This operation is performed, not only by a flail, as is customary in Europe, or by cattle treading the com in the&nbsp;manner of other orientalists, but sometimes also by striking it against a plank set upon its edge, or beating it against&nbsp;the side of a large tub scolloped for that purpose ; the back&nbsp;and sides being much higher than the front, to prevent the&nbsp;grain from being dispersed. After being winnowed, it is&nbsp;carried to the granary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ To remove the skin or husk of rice, a large strong earthen vessel, or hollow stone, in form somewhat like that&nbsp;which is used elsewhere for filtering water, is fixed firmly&nbsp;in the ground ; and the grain, placed in it, is struck with a&nbsp;conical stone fixed to the extremity of a lever, and cleared,&nbsp;sometimes indeed imperfectly, from the husk. The stone&nbsp;is worked frequently by a person treading upon the end of&nbsp;the lever. The same object is attained also by passing the&nbsp;grain between two flat stones of a circular form, the upper&nbsp;of which turns round upon the other, but at such a distance&nbsp;from it as not to break the intermediate grain. The operation is performed on a large scale in mills turned by water ; the axis of the wheel carrying several arms, which by&nbsp;striking upon the ends of levers, raise them in the same&nbsp;manner as is done by treading on them. Sometimes twenty&nbsp;of these levers are worked at once. The straw from which&nbsp;the grain has been disengaged is cut chiefly into chaff, to&nbsp;serve as provender for the very few cattle employed in the&nbsp;Chinese husbandry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The labour of the first crop being finished, the ground is immediately prepared for the reception of fresh seeds.&nbsp;The first operation undertaken is that of pulling up the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">stubble, collecting it into small heaps, which are burnt, and the ashes scattered upon the field. The former processes&nbsp;are afterwards renewed. The second crop is generally ripe&nbsp;late in October or early in November. The grain is treated as before ; but the stubble is no longer burnt. It is&nbsp;turned under with the plough, and left to putrefy in the&nbsp;earth. This, with the slime brought upon the ground by&nbsp;inundation, are the only manures usually employed in the&nbsp;culture of rice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHARDSON, Samuel, a novelist of great celebrity, was born in the year 1689, in Derbyshire, but in what particular place has not been ascertained. His father, the descendant of a reputable family in the county of Surrey, followed the occupation of a joiner. The son was at first intended for the church ; but after his father had sustained&nbsp;some heavy losses, he was left, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, to make choice of some employment which did not&nbsp;require so expensive a preparation. He only appears to&nbsp;have received the most ordinary training of a country school.&nbsp;Latin words and phrases are to be found in his works, but&nbsp;there is no reason to believe that he had acquired even an&nbsp;elementary knowledge of that language, nor was he afterwards induced to make the more easy acquisition of French.&nbsp;But he had access to the rich and ample treasures of English literature, and he became deeply read in the book of&nbsp;human nature. He was a bashful boy, and gave an early&nbsp;reference to the society of the other sex. From his child-ood he delighted in letter-writing ; and to this early taste&nbsp;we may trace the germ of his principal works. “ I was&nbsp;not more than thirteen,” he informs us, “ when three of&nbsp;these young women, unknown to each other, having an&nbsp;high opinion of my taciturnity, revealed to me their love-secrets, in order to induce me to give them copies to write,&nbsp;alter, or correct, for answers to their lovers’ letters ; nor&nbsp;did any one of them ever know that I was the secretary to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his choice of an employment he was chiefly guided by his love of reading. In 1706 he was bound apprentice&nbsp;to John Wilde, a printer at Stationers Hall. Although he&nbsp;served a rigid master, he contrived to steal from his hours&nbsp;of rest and relaxation some precious intervals for the improvement of his mind. After the completion of his apprenticeship, he continued for five or six years to work as&nbsp;a compositor and corrector in a printing office, and part of&nbsp;this time as an overseer. Thus he gradually emerged to&nbsp;the situation of a master-printer, having first taken an office in a court in Fleet-street, and afterwards in Salisbury-court. As an apprentice he had been diligent and conscientious, as a master he was assiduous and liberal. In addition to the proper avocations of a printer, he on various&nbsp;occasions undertook to write indices, prefaces, and, as he&nbsp;describes them, honest dedications. The punctuality, to- <sup></sup>gether with the integrity and liberality of his dealings,&nbsp;speedily procured him friends, and his business became very&nbsp;prosperous. Through the interest of the Speaker, Mr Onslow, he was employed to print the Journals of the House&nbsp;of Commons, in twenty-six volumes folio. In 1754 he was&nbsp;chosen master of the Stationers’ Company. In 1760 he&nbsp;purchased a moiety of the patent of law-printer to his majesty, and in this branch of his business he was conjoined&nbsp;with Miss Catherine Lintot. He was thus enabled to live&nbsp;in comfort, and to make a suitable provision for his family.&nbsp;Like other prosperous citizens, he set a due value on country air, and had first a residence at North-end near Hammersmith, and afterwards at Parsons-green near Fulham,&nbsp;where he spent such intervals of time as he could spare from&nbsp;business, and where he was seldom without visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first work that recommended him to public notice was “ Pamela, or Virtue rewarded,” published in the year&nbsp;1741. The tw<sup>,</sup>o volumes, of which it originally consisted,&nbsp;appear to have been written in less than three months. Its</span></p>
