Other leaders entered into a negociation with the Engliſh. Bruce, the Steward and his brother Alexander de Lindeſay, and Sir William Douglas, acknowledged their offences, and made ſubmiſſions to Edward for themſelves and their adherents.</p><p>This ſcandalous treaty ſeems to have been negociated by the biſhop of Glaſgow, and their recantation is recorded in the following words. —Be it known to all men: Whereas we, with the commons of our country, did riſe in arms againſt our lord Edward, and againſt his peace, in his territories of Scotland and Galloway, did burn, flay, and commit divers robberies; we therefore, in our own name, and in the name of all our adherents, agree to make every reparation and atonement that ſhall be required by our ſovereign lord; reſerving always what is contained in a writing which we have procured from Sir Henry Percy and Sir Robert Clifford, commanders of the Engliſh forces; at Irvine, 9th July 1297.” To this inſtrument was ſubjoined,  "Eſcrit a Sire Willaume;” the meaning of which lord Hailes ſuppoſes to be, that the barons had notified to Sir William Wallace their having made terms of accommodation for themſelves and their party.</p><p>Edward accepted the ſubmiſſion of the Scottiſh barons who had been in arms, and granted liberty to thoſe whom he had made priſoners in the courſe of the former year, on condition that they ſhould ſerve him in his wars againſt France. The inconſtancy of Bruce, however, was ſo great, that acknowledgments of ſubmiſſion or oaths of fealty were not thought ſufficiently binding on him; for which reaſon the biſhop of Glaſgow, the Steward, and Alexander de Lindeſay, became ſureties for his loyalty and good behaviour, until he ſhould deliver his daughter Marjory as an hoſtage.</p><p>Wallace alone refuſed to be concerned in theſe ſhameful ſubmiſſions; and, with a few reſolute followers, reſolved to ſubmit to every calamity rather than give up the liberty of his country. The barons had undertaken to procure his ſubmiſſion as well as their own; but finding that to be impoſſible, the biſhop of Glaſgow and Sir William Douglas voluntarily ſurrendered themſelves priſoners to the Engliſh. Edward, however, aſcribed this voluntary ſurrender, not to any honourable motive, but to treachery. He aſſerted, that Wiſheart repaired to the caſtle of Roxburgh under pretence of yielding himſelf up, but with the concealed purpoſe of forming a conſpiracy in order to betray that caſtle to the Scots; and in proof of this, Edward appealed to intercepted letters of Wiſheart. On the other hand, Wallace, aſcribing the biſhop’s conduct to traiterous puſillanimity, plundered his houſe, and carried off his family captives.</p><p>Immediately after the defection of the barons at Irvine, Wallace with his band of determined followers attacked the rear of the Engliſh army, and plundered their baggage; but was obliged to retire, with the loſs of 1000 men. He then found himſelf deſerted by almoſt all the men of eminence and property. His army, however, increaſed conſiderably by the acceſſion of numbers of inferior rank, and he again began to act on the oſſenſive. While he employed himſelf in beſieging the caſtle of Dundee, he was informed that the Engliſh army approached Stirling. Wallace, having charged the citizens of Dundee, under the pain of death, to continue the blockade of the caſtle, haſtened with all his troops to guard the important paſſage of the Forth; and encamped behind a riſing ground in the neighbourhood of the abbey of Cambuſkenneth. Brian Fitz-Allan had been appointed governor of Scotland by Edward; but Warenne, who waited the arrival of his ſucceſſor, remained with the army. Imagining that Wallace might be induced by fair means to lay down his arms, he diſpatched two friars to the Scottiſh camp, with terms of capitulation. “Return,” ſaid "Wallace, “and tell your matters, that we came not here to treat but to affert our right, and to ſet Scotland free. Let them advance, they will find us prepared.” The Engliſh, provoked at this anſwer, demanded impatiently to be led on to battle. Sir Richard Lundin remonſtrated againſt the abſurdity of making a numerous army paſs by a long narrow bridge in preſence of the enemy. He told them, that the Scots would attack them before they could form on the plain to the north of the bridge, and thus certainly defeat them: at the ſame time he offered to ſhow them a ford, which having croſſed with 500 horſe, and a choſen detachment of infantry, he propoſed to come round upon the rear of the enemy, and by this diverſion facilitate the operations of the main body. But this propoſal being rejected, the Engliſh army began to paſs over; which was no ſooner perceived by Wallace, than he ruſhed down upon them, and broke them in a moment. Creſſingham the treaſurer was killed, and many thouſands were ſlain on the field, or drowned in their flight. The loſs of the Scots would have been inconſiderable, had it not been for that of Sir Andrew Moray, the intimate friend and companion of Wallace, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. The Scots are ſaid to have treated the dead body of Creſſingham with the utmoſt indignity; to have ſlead him, and cut his ſkin into pieces, which they divided among themſelves; while others tell us, they uſed it for making girths, and ſaddles.</p><p>The victory at Stirling was followed by the ſurrender of Dundee caſtle, and other places of ſtrength in Scotland; at the fame time the Scots took poſſeſſion of Berwick, which the Engliſh had evacuated. But as a famine now took place in Scotland by the bad ſeaſons and miſeries of war, Wallace marched with his whole army into England, that he might in ſome meaſure relieve the neceſſities of his countrymen by plundering the enemy. This expedition laſted three weeks, during which time the whole tract of country from Cocker- mouth and Carliſle to the gates of Newcaſtle was laid waſte with all the fury of revenge and rapacity; though Wallace endeavoured, as far as poſſible, to repreſs the licentiouſneſs of his ſoldiers.</p><p>In 1298, Wallace aſſumed the title of “Governor of Scotland, in name of king John, and by conſent of the Scottiſh nation;” but in what manner this office was obtained, is now in a great meaſure unknown. In a parliament which he convoked at Perth, he was confirmed in his authority; and under this title he conferred the conſtabulary of Dundee on Alexander ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Skrimgeour</hi> and his heirs, on account of his faithful aid in bearing the royal ſtandard of Scotland.
