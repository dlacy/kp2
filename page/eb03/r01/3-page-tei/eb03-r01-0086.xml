After the operation is finiſh-ed, a regulus of arſenic will be found at the bottom of the crucible of a white livid colour, and of confiderable ſolidity. The iron and copper employed in this pro-ceſs are not intended, as in the operation for the martial regulus of antimony, to precipitate the arſenic, and to ſeparate it from ſulphur or any other ſubſtance; for the white arſenic is pure, and nothing is to be taken from it; but, on the contrary, the inflammable principle is to be added to reduce it to a regulus. The true uſe oi theſe metals in the preſent operation is to unite with the regulus of arſenic, to give it more body, and to prevent its entire diſſipation in vapours. Hence the addition oſ iron, while it procures theſe advantages, has the in-conveniency of altering the purity of the regulus : for the metallic ſubſtance obtained is a regulus of arſenic allayed with iron. It may, however, be purified ſrom the iron by ſublimation in a clofe veffel ; by which operation the reguliſed arſenical part, whieh is very volatile, is fublimed to the top of the veffel, and is ſeparated from the iron, which being of a fixed nature remains at the bottom. λVe are not, however, very certain, that in this kind of rectification the regulus of arſenic does not carry along with it a certain quantity of iron ; for, in general, a volatile ſubſtance raiſes along with it, in ſublimation, a part of any fixed matter with which it happened to be united.</p><p>Mr Brandt propoſes another method, which we believe is preferable to that deſcribed. He directs that white arſenic ſſiould be mixed with ſoap. Inſtead of the ſoap, olive-oil may be uſed, which has been found to ſucceed well. The mixture is to be put into a retort or glaſs matraſs, and to be diſtilled or fublimed with fire, at fiiſt very moderate, and only ſuſſicient to raiſe thc oil. As the oils, which are not volatile, cannot be diſtilled but by a heat ſufficient to burn and decoπv poſe them, the oil therefore which is mixed with the arſenie undergoes theſe alterations, and after having penetrated the arſenic thoroughly ls reduced to a coal, when no more oily vapours riſe, we may then know that the oil is reduced to coal. Then the fire muſt be increaſed, and the metalliſed arſenie will be ſoon ſublimed to the upper part of the veffel, in the inſide of which it will form a metallic cruft, when no more ſublimes, the veffel is to be broken, and the adhering cruſt of regulus of arſenic is to be ſeparated. The regulus obtained by this firſt operation is not generally perfect, or not entirely ſo, as a part of it is always overcharged with fuliginous matter, and another part has not enough of phlogiſton ; which latter part adheres to the inner ſuiface of the cruſt, and forms grey ■or brown cryſtals. This ſublimate muſt then be mixed</p><p>with a leſs quantity of oil, and ſublimed a ſecond time like the firſt ; and even, to obtain as good regulus as may be made, a third ſublimation in a cloſe veſtel, and without oil, is neceffary. During this operation, the oil whieh riſes is more fetid than any other empyreu-matic oil, and is almoſt iiiſupportable. This ſmell certainly proceeds from the arſenic ; the ſmell of which is exceedingly ſtrong and disagreeable when heated.</p><p>' Regulus of arſenic made by the method we have de-ſcribed, and which we confider as the only one which is pure, has ail the properties oſ a ſemimetal. It has metallic gravity, opacity, and luſtre. Its colour is white and livid, .it tarniſhes in the air, is very brittle, but much more volatile than any other ſemime£al. It eaſily lofes its inflammable principle, when ſublimed in veffels into which the air has aeeeſs ; the fι&gt;blimate having the appearance of grey flowers, which by repeated ſublimations become entirely white, and ſimilar to white cryllalline arſenic. when regulus of arſenic is heated quickly and ſtrongly in open air, as under a muffle, it burns with a white or bluiſſi flame, and diſ-ſipates in a thick fume, which has a very fetid ſinell, like that of garlic.</p><p>Regulus of arſenic may be combined with acids and moſt metals. See Arsenic, n<hi rend="sup">Q</hi> 17. we ſhall only far-ther obſerve here, that, according to Mr Brandt, in the Swediſh Memoirs, the regulus of arfenic cannot be united with mercury. Although the phenomena exhibited by white arſenic and regulus of arſenie in ſo-lutions and allays are probably the lame, yet an accurate compariſon of thefe would defer ve notice, eſpecially if the regulus employed were well made; for ſome difference muſt proceed from the greater or leſs quantity of what in the old chemiſtry is called phlogiſton with which it is united. See Chemistry, n<hi rend="sup">0</hi> 1288, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Regulus of Cobalt,</hi></hi>  is a ſemimetal lately diſcovered, and not yet perfectly well known. It receives its name from cobalt, becaufe it can only be extracted from the mineral properly ſo called. The proceſs by which this ſemimetal is obtained, is fimilar to thoſe generally uied for the extraction of metals from their ores. The co-balt muſt be thoroughly torrified, to deprive it of all the ſulphur and arſenic it contains ; and the unmetallic earthy and ſtony matters muſt be feparated by waſhing. The cobalt thus prepared is then to be mixed with double or triple its quantity of black flux, and a little decrepitated ſea-ſalt; and muſt be fufed either in a forge or in a hot furnace, for this ore is very difficult of fu-fion. when the fuſton has been well made, we find upon breaking the crucible, after it has cooled, a metallic regulus covered with a ſcoria of a deep blue co· lour. The regulus is of a white metallic colour. The ſurface of its fracture is cloſe and ſmall-grained. The ſemimetal is hard, but brittle, when the fuſion has been well made, its lurface appears to be carved with many convex threads, which croſs each other diverſely. As almoft all cobalts contain alſo biſmuth, and even as much as of the regulus itſelf, this biſmuth is reduced by the fame operation, and precipitated in the ſame manner, as the regulus of cobalt ; for although theſe two metals are frequently mixed in the ſame mineral, that is, in cobalt, they are incapable of uniting toge-ther, and are always found diſtinct aud ſeparate from one another when they are melted together. At the bottom of the crucible then we find both regulus of cobalt and biſinuth. The latter, having a greater ſpe-ciſie gravity, is found under the former. They may be</p><p>ſeparated from each other by the blow of a hammer. Biſmuth may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the regulus of cobalt, not only from its ſituation in the crucible, but alſo by the large ihining facets which appear in its fracture, aud which are very different from the eloſe aſh* coloured grain of regulus of cobalt.</p><p>This ſemimetal is more- difficult of fuſion. than any</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
