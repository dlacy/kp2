<p><span class="font1">for 1909, Tit. xiv., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de Vestitu et habitu,</span><span class="font1"> pp. 327-328) have not been revised lately, and some of them are a dead letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Doctors of both universities have three sets of robes: firstly, the full-dress gown of scarlet cloth; secondly, the congregation habit and hood of scarlet (now at Cambridge a cope,&nbsp;at Oxford the so-called “cope”); thirdly, the black gown.&nbsp;The. first is worn by all doctors except the doctor of music,&nbsp;and is accompanied by the round cap of velvet. The Oxford&nbsp;D.D. also wears a cassock, sash and scarf. The scarlet gown&nbsp;is of a different and older shape than the M.A. and B.A. gowns.&nbsp;As now worn, it is faced with silk of the same colour as the&nbsp;hood of the faculty. The second, or cope, has now gone&nbsp;almost out of use, but is still worn when presenting for degrees,&nbsp;&amp;c. It is sometimes worn over the black gown. There are&nbsp;several types of black gown, but the tufted gown of Loggan’s&nbsp;day has now gone out of use. The M.D. and Mus.D. black&nbsp;gowns at Cambridge are now made after the pattern of the&nbsp;LL.D. gown, with wing-like sleeve and flap collar, trimmed&nbsp;with black lace, but the D.D., D.Sc. and Litt.D. wear the&nbsp;M.A. gown, the former with the scarf, the two latter with&nbsp;lace on the sleeve, placed horizontally for D.Sc. and vertically&nbsp;for Litt.D. Some doctors of divinity wear the full-sleeved&nbsp;gown with scarf. The head-dress of a D.D. is the square&nbsp;cap, that of the lay doctors the velvet bonnet with gold cord.&nbsp;At Oxford, too, some doctors wear the M.A. gown, others the&nbsp;doctor’s laced gown. The M.A. and B.A. gowns are two&nbsp;varieties of the civilian gown of the 15th and 16th century.&nbsp;The B.A. loose-sleeved gown is no longer worn with the sleeve&nbsp;tucked up round the elbow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Oxford sleeveless commoner’s gown, though still by statute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">talaris,</span><span class="font1"> now reaches little below the waist, the&nbsp;full-sleeved scholar’s gown to the knees. The tufted silk&nbsp;gown of the gentleman-commoner and the nobleman’s gold-laced gown are not yet abolished by statute, but have&nbsp;fallen into disuse. Vice-Chancellors have no official costume,&nbsp;but wear the habit of their degree. The Chancellors of the&nbsp;older universities wear a black damask robe with gold lace,&nbsp;and a black velvet square cap with gold tassel or a doctor’s&nbsp;velvet bonnet with gold cord; those of the newer universities&nbsp;have robes “ created ” by the robe-makers, who are nowadays&nbsp;to a large extent the arbiters of academic dress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBESPIERRE, MAXIMILIEN FRANÇOIS MARIE ISIDORE </span><span class="font1">DE (1758-1794), French revolutionist, was born at Arras on&nbsp;the 6th of May 1758. His family, according to tradition, was&nbsp;of Irish descent, having emigrated from Ireland at the time of&nbsp;the Reformation on account of religion, and his direct ancestors&nbsp;in the male line had been notaries at the little village of Carvin&nbsp;near Arras from the beginning of the 17th century. His grandfather, being more ambitious, established himself at Arras&nbsp;as an advocate; and his father followed the same profession,&nbsp;marrying Jacqueline Marguerite Carraut, daughter of a brewer&nbsp;in the same city, in 1757. Of this marriage four children were&nbsp;born, two sons« and two daughters, of whom Maximilien was&nbsp;the eldest; but in 1767 Madame Derobespierre, as the name&nbsp;was then spelt, died, and the disconsolate widower at once&nbsp;left Arras and wandered about Europe until his death at Munich&nbsp;in 1769. The children were taken charge of by their maternal&nbsp;grandfather and aunts, and Maximilien was sent to the college&nbsp;of Arras, whence he was nominated in 1770 through the bishop&nbsp;of his native town to a bursarship at the college of Louis-le-Grand at Paris. Here he had for fellow-pupils Camille Desmoulins and Stanislas Fréron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Completing his law studies with distinction, and having been admitted an advocate in 1781, Robespierre returned to his&nbsp;native city to seek for practice, and to struggle against poverty.&nbsp;His reputation had already preceded him, and the bishop of&nbsp;Arras, M. de Conzié, appointed him criminal judge in the diocese&nbsp;of Arras in March 1782. This appointment, which he soon&nbsp;resigned, to avoid pronouncing a sentence of death, did not&nbsp;prevent his practising at the bar, and he speedily became&nbsp;a successful advocate. He now turned to literature and&nbsp;society, and came to be esteemed as one of the best writers&nbsp;and most popular dandies of Arras. In December 1783 he was&nbsp;elected a member of the academy of Arras, the meetings of&nbsp;which he attended regularly; and, like all other young Frenchmen with literary proclivities, he began to compete for the&nbsp;prizes offered by various provincial academies. In 1784 he&nbsp;obtained a medal from the academy of Metz for his essay on&nbsp;the question whether the relatives of a condemned criminal&nbsp;should share his disgrace, the prize being divided between him&nbsp;and Pierre Louis Lacretelle, an advocate and journalist in&nbsp;Paris. An </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">éloge</span><span class="font1"> on J. B. L. Gresset (1709-1777), the author&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vert-Vert</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Mechant,</span><span class="font1"> written for the academy of Amiens&nbsp;in 1785, was not more successful; but Robespierre was compensated for these failures by his great popularity in the little&nbsp;literary and musical society at Arras known as the “ Rosati,”&nbsp;of which Carnot was also a member. There the sympathetic&nbsp;quality of Robespierre’s voice, W’hich afterwards did him such&nbsp;good service in the Jacobin Club, always caused bis indifferent&nbsp;verses to be loudly applauded by his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1788 he took part in the discussion as to the way in which the states-general should be elected, showing clearly and forcibly&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adresse à la nation artésienne</span><span class="font1"> that, if the former mode&nbsp;of election by the members of the provincial estates were again&nbsp;adopted, the new states-gemral would not represent the people&nbsp;of France. Necker also perceived this, and therefore determined to make the old royal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bailliages</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sénéchaussées</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;units of election, which thus took place on the basis of almost&nbsp;universal suffrage. Under this plan the city of Arras was to&nbsp;return twenty-four members to the assembly of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Artois, which was to elect the deputies. The corporation&nbsp;claimed the right to a preponderating influence in these city&nbsp;elections, and Robespierre headed the opposition, making&nbsp;himself very conspicuous and drawing up the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cahier,</span><span class="font1"> or table&nbsp;of complaints and grievances, for the gild of the cobblers.&nbsp;Although the leading members of the corporation were elected,&nbsp;their chief opponent succeeded in getting elected with them.&nbsp;In the assembly of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage</span><span class="font1"> rivalry ran still higher, but&nbsp;Robespierre had already made his mark in politics; by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Avis aux habitants de Campagne</span><span class="font1"> (Arras, 1789), which is almost&nbsp;certainly by-him, he secured the support of the country electors,&nbsp;and, though but thirty years of age, poor and without influence,&nbsp;he was elected fifth deputy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tiers état</span><span class="font1"> of Artois to the&nbsp;states-general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the states-general met at Versailles on 5th May 1789, the young deputy of Artois already possessed the one faculty&nbsp;which w<sup>r</sup>as to lead him to supremacy: he was a fanatic. As&nbsp;Mirabeau is reported to have said: “ That young man believes&nbsp;what he says: he will go far.” Without the courage and wide&nbsp;tolerance which make a statesman, without the greatest qualities&nbsp;of an orator, without the belief in himself which marks a great&nbsp;man, nervous, timid and suspicious, Robespierre yet believed&nbsp;in the doctrines of Rousseau with all his heart, and would&nbsp;have gone to death for them; and in the belief that they would&nbsp;eventually succeed and regenerate France and mankind, he was&nbsp;ready to work with unwearied patience. While the Constituent&nbsp;Assembly occupied itself in drawing up a constitution, Robespierre turned from the assembly of provincial lawyers and&nbsp;wealthy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeois</span><span class="font1"> to the people of Paris. However, he spoke&nbsp;frequently in the Constituent Assembly, and often with great&nbsp;success, and was eventually recognized as second only to Petion&nbsp;de Villeneuve—if second to him—as a leader of the small body&nbsp;of the extreme left,—the thirty voices, as Mirabeau contemptuously called them. It is hardly necessary to examine minutely&nbsp;Robespierre’s speeches and behaviour before 1791, when the&nbsp;death of Mirabeau left the way clear for the influence of his&nbsp;party; but what is noteworthy, as proving the religious cast&nbsp;of his mind and his belief in the necessity of a religion, is· that&nbsp;he spoke several times in favour of the lower clergy and laboured&nbsp;to get their pensions increased. When he instinctively felt&nbsp;that his doctrines would have no success in the Assembly, he&nbsp;turned to the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, known</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
