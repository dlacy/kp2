Treatises on eloquence which aim at expounding its principles, can seldom, in regard to the critical branch, do more than recommend its prosecution, or practically countenance it by incidental illustrations ; but it possesses such importance as to merit a more prominent place than it occupies in most systematic works on the subject.</p><p>Lastly, long practice must be added to all these studies before the end can even be approached. This requisite, however, a treatise on rhetoric can do little more than acknowledge and urge.</p><p>In pursuance of the opinions now expressed, these pages will endeavour to illustrate the subject in Three Divisions. The First will embrace general observations, intended to elicit the true principles of Eloquence, and to exhibit them in various points of view. From our strong impression as to the predominant importance of the general principles over the special rules, we shall be tempted to linger on this branch longer than may be approved by those who are attached to the minutiæ of the study ; and for the same reason we will not allow ourselves to be deterred by the fear of being charged with truisms, from stating considerations which seem calculated to lead us nearer to the goal. The Second Division will contain a brief summary of the most important principles which have been expounded in the best systems of rhetoric ; our principal guides, however, being the treatises of Aristotle, Dr Campbell, and Archbishop Whately. The Third Division will attempt to furnish the student with some aids towards his critical acquaintance with models.</p><p>I.</p><p>“ The word Eloquence,” says Campbell, adopting the ancient definitions, “ in its greatest latitude, denotes ‘ that art or talent by which a discourse is adapted to its end.’ All the ends of speaking are reducible to four; every speech being intended to enlighten the understanding, to please the imagination, to move the passions, or to influence the will.” The observations by which the same most acute writer immediately afterwards illustrates this his leading proposition, have much truth and great value. It is said, first, that “ any one discourse admits only one of these ends as the principal,” to which the others, so far as they are admissible at all, must be rendered conducive ; secondly, that “ each preceding species, in the order above exhibited, is preparatory to the subsequent ;” thirdly, that, in addressing the understanding, the speaker proposes either to explain to his hearers something unknown or not distinctly comprehended, or to prove something disbelieved or doubted ; so that, “ in the one case, his aim is their information, in the other their conviction ;” fourthly, that the address to the imagination is common to oratory with poctry, to which indeed it may be added, that the address to the passions must also be considered common to these two arts ; and, lastly, that the height of success in persuasion, the fourth end of the orator, is attained by effecting all these ends in the same discourse.</p><p>The analysis, to the extent to which it goes, is strictly accurate; and there is no just reason for refusing to predicate eloquence of every composition written or spoken, which fulfils its conditions. A simple and perspicuous narrative of facts,-—an unimpassioned but convincing argument in proof of a controverted proposition in any department of moral knowledge,—and a harangue which, convincing our understanding of what is, or seems to be, an important truth, summoning before our fancy vivid images of its consequences, and, kindling into flame the most powerful emotions of our nature, hurries us irresistibly to resolution and to action,—each of these exertions of intellect may, in its own sphere, be fully deserving of the appellation of eloquent, because each may possess all the qualities which fit it for producing its end. But we shall still be in danger of misapprehending the real essence of eloquence, unless we state to ourselves substantively, and bring prominently to light, certain principles which the analysis involves, but which it passes over slightly.</p><p>It is rightly said, that each of the purposes of eloquence rises out of, and is necessarily founded on, those which precede it. In other words, the information or conviction of the understanding does, in the first place, lie at the root of all eloquence ; no composition is eloquent which does not effect this end. The state of mind which eloquence in all circumstances necessarily produces, is that of Belief. This is the fundamental proposition of the Rhetorical Art, and on it depends every well-founded rule which Rhetoric can deduce from its principles. We cannot have the proposition too strongly impressed on our minds ; and we may be assured that, the farther we diverge from its central point, the more we shall find ourselves removed from the ability to apprehend or reduce to practice the principles of Eloquent Composition.</p><p>The most common definition of Rhetoric describes it as the Art of Persuasion, a view derived from some of the ancient writers, whose instructions were almost wholly addressed to the case of public speaking in courts of law and popular assemblies. The definition, although it involves the true principle, is slightly faulty, both by excess and by defect. It says more than is true, in stating influence on the will as essential to eloquence ; and, on the other hand, it is apt to lead us away from the principle, by tempting us to forget that, as is well said by Whately, the latest and one of the very ablest of the rhetorical writers, “ the conviction of the understanding is an essential part of persuasion.” If we must describe Rhetoric by a reference to its purpose, we shall perhaps incur the least risk of mistake by stating simply, that it aims, through the instrumentality of language, at the Production of Belief ; and we may perhaps venture to suggest, that this seems to be the true meaning, both of the introductory definition, and of the numerous incidental illustrations, which we find in a treatise at once the oldest and the best upon the subject, namely, the Rhetoric of Aristotle.</p><p>But since rhetoric, so far as it can be treated as a science (which to a certain extent it may), is called on to investigate principles which a writer or speaker must obey, in order to command belief, and since, too, its inquiries must embrace, not only the laws which regulate the conviction of the understanding, but also those which rule in the excitement of the imagination and the feelings,— it may be asked w hether its province does not in several quarters extend over ground belonging properly to Otller departments of the mental philosophy. The answer to this question is twofold. There are certain principles which rhetoric does not establish for itself, but assumes as proved by common observation, and by the researches instituted in other branches of mental science ; but it also possesses principles which are peculiar to itself, and bring it into no collision even with those other walks of philosophy with which it may be suspected of being identical. By endeavouring at this stage to illustrate both of these propositions, w<hi rend="sup">i</hi>e shall be enabled to bring into a strong light some considerations which might be overlooked if introduced incidentally an bcaring on specific rules.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
