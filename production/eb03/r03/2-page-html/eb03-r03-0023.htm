<p><span class="font0">the yarns muſt be exerting twice this force. Now let the ſame yarn, ſpun up to one-half, be made up in </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſtrand, and let the ſtrand be twiſted in the oppoſite direction to the ſpinning till it has acquired the ſatne&nbsp;elaſtſeſty fit for laying. The yarns are untwiſted. Sup-ρofe to three-fourths of the length oſ the fibres. They&nbsp;are now exerting only four-thirds of the force neceſlary&nbsp;for laying, that is, two-thirds of what they were obliged&nbsp;to exert in the other caſe; and thus we have ſtronger&nbsp;yarns when the ſtrands are equally ſtrained. But they&nbsp;require to be more ſtrained than the other ; which, being made of more twi 'ed yarn, ſoon,er acquire the elaſticity’' fit for laying. But ſince the elaſticſty which fits&nbsp;the ſtrand ſor laying does not increaſe ſo faſt as the&nbsp;ſtrain on the fibres of the yarn which produces it, it is&nbsp;plain, that when each has acquired that elaſticity which&nbsp;is proper for laying, the ſtrands made of the flack-twiſted yarn are the ſtrongeſt ; and the yarns are alſo&nbsp;the ſtrongeſt ; and being ſoſter, the rope will cloſe&nbsp;better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Experience confirms all this ; and cordage, whoſe ſtrands are twiſted in the oppoſite direction to the twiſt&nbsp;of ſpinning, are found to be ſtronger than the others in&nbsp;a proportion not leſs than that of 7 to 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such being the difficulty of making a large ſtrand, and its deſects when made, w<sup>,</sup>e have fallen on a method&nbsp;of making great cordage by laying it tw’ſee. A haw-ſer-laid rope, flack ſpun, little hardened in the ſtrands,&nbsp;and flack laid, is made a ſtrand of a large rope called a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cable</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cablet.</span><span class="font0"> The advantages of this fabric are evident. The ſtrands are reduced to one-third or one-fourth&nbsp;of the diameter which they would have in a hawffer of&nbsp;the ſame ſize. Such ſtrands cannot have their yarns&nbsp;lying very obliquely, and the outer yarns cannot be&nbsp;much more ſtrained than the inner ones. There muſt&nbsp;therefore be a much greater equality in the whole ſubſtance of cable-laid cordage, and ſrom this we ſhould&nbsp;expect ſuperior ſtrength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Accordingly, their ſuperiority is great, not leſs than </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">the proportion of 13 to 9, which is not far from the&nbsp;proportion of 4 to 3. A cable is more than a fourth&nbsp;part, but is not a third part, ſtronger than </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">hawſer of&nbsp;the ſame ſize or weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are ſeldom made of more than three hawſers of three ſtrands each, though they are ſometimes made&nbsp;of three four-ſtranded hawſers, or of four three-ſtrand-ed. The ſirſt of theſe two is preferred, becauſe four&nbsp;ſmall ſtrands can be laid very cloſe ; whereas it is difficult to lay well four hawſers, already become very&nbsp;hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſuperiority of a cable-laid cordage being attributed entirely to the greater perfection of the ſtrands, and this ſeeming to ariſe entirely from their&nbsp;ſmallneſs, it was natural to expect ſtill better cordage&nbsp;by laying cables as the ſtrands of ſtill larger pieces. It&nbsp;has been tried, and wfith every requifite attention. But&nbsp;although they have always equalled, they have not decidedly excelled, common cables of the ſame weight ;&nbsp;and they require a great deal more work. We ſhall&nbsp;not therefore enter upon the manipulations of this fa- .&nbsp;bric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is only one point of the mechanical proceſs of rope-making which we have not conſidered minutely ;&nbsp;and it is an important one, viz. the diſtribution of the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">total ſhortening of the yarns between the hardening of the ſtrands and the laying the rope. This is a point&nbsp;about which the artiſts are by no means agreed. There&nbsp;is certainly a poſition of the ſtrands of a laid rope which&nbsp;puts every part in equilibrio ; and this is what an elaſtic, but perfectly ſoſt rope (were ſuch a thing poſſible),&nbsp;would aſſume. But this cannot be diſcovered by any&nbsp;experiments made on large or even on firm cordage ; and&nbsp;it may not be thought ſuſſiciently clear that the pro-∣&nbsp;portion which would be diſcovered by the careful fabri-<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>cation of a very ſmall and ſoſt line is the ſame that’&nbsp;wfill fuit a cordage of any diameter. We muſt proceed <sub>j&nbsp;</sub>much on conjecture ; and w;e cannot ſay that the arguments uſed by the partiſans of different proportions are&nbsp;very convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general practice, we believe, is to divide the whole of the intended ſhortening of the yarns, or the&nbsp;w'orking up into three parts, and to employ two of&nbsp;theſe in hardening the ſtrands, and the remaining third&nbsp;in cloſing the haw-ſer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Du Hamel thinks, that this repartition is injudicious, and that the yarns are too much ſtrained, and the ſtrands rendered weak. He recommends to invert&nbsp;this proportion, and to ſhorten one-third in the hardening of the ſtrands, and two-thirds in laying the hawſer.&nbsp;But if the ſtrain of the yarns only is conſidered, one&nbsp;ſhould think that the outſide yarn of a ſtrand will be&nbsp;more ſtrained in laying, in proportion to the yarn of&nbsp;the ſame ſtrand, that is, in the very axis of the rope.&nbsp;We can only ſay, that if a very ſoft line is formed in&nbsp;this way, it will not keep its twiſt. This ſhows that&nbsp;the turns in laying were more than what the elaſticity&nbsp;or hardening of the ſtrands required. The experiments&nbsp;made on ſoft lines always ſhowed a tendency to take a&nbsp;greater twiſt when the lines were made in the firſt manner, and a tendency to loſe their twiſt when made in&nbsp;Mr Du Hamel’s manner. We imagine that the true&nbsp;proportion is between theſe two extremes, and that we&nbsp;ſhall not err greatly if w’e halve the total ſhortening between the two parts of the proceſs. If working up to&nbsp;two-thirds be inſiſted upon, and if it be really too much,&nbsp;Mr Du Hamel’s repartition may be better, becauſe&nbsp;part of this working will quickly go off when the cordage is uſed. But it is ſurely better to be right in the&nbsp;main point, the total working up, and then to adjuſt&nbsp;the diſtribution of it ſo that the finiſhed cordage ſhall&nbsp;preciſely keep the form we have given to it. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There muſt be the ſame uncertainty in the quadruple diſtribution of the working up a cable. When a cable&nbsp;has its yarns ſhortened to two-thirds, w<sup>,</sup>e believe the ordinary practice has been, iff, To warp 180 fathoms;&nbsp;2d, To harden up the ſtrands 30 fathoms ; 3d, To lay&nbsp;or cloſe up 13 fathoms ; 4th, To work up the hawſers&nbsp;nine fathoms ; 5th, To cloſe up eight fathoms. This&nbsp;leaves a cable of 120. Since Mr Du Hamel’s cxperi*&nbsp;ments have had an influence at Rochefort, the practice&nbsp;has been to warp 190, to harden up 38, to lay up 12;&nbsp;to work up the hawſers 1 o, and then to cloſe up fix ;&nbsp;andwfiιen the cable is finiſhed, to ſhorten it tw<sup>r</sup>o fathoms&nbsp;. more, which our workmen call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">throwing the turn well&nbsp;up.</span><span class="font0"> This leaves a cable of 1 2 2 fathoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As there ſeems little doubt of the ſuperiority of cordage ſhortened one-fourth over cordage ſhortened one-third, the followfing diſtribution may be adopted : warp</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
