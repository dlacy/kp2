<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">caſe, what is the velocity of the internal fiîaments in </span><span class="font4">the different points of their progreſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such is the dtmonſtration which Mr Bernouilli has given of this propofition. Limited as it is, it is highly&nbsp;valuable, becauſe derived from the true principles of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">hydraulics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He hoped to render it more extenfive and applicable to oblique impulfes, when the axis AC of the vein&nbsp;(fig. 13. n<sup>0</sup> 2.) is inclined to the plane in an angle&nbsp;ACN. But here all the ſimplicity of the caſe is gone,&nbsp;and we are now obliged to aſcertain the motion of each&nbsp;filament. It might not perhaps be impoſſible to determine what muſt happen in the plane of the figure,&nbsp;that is, in a plane paſſing through the axis of the vein,&nbsp;and perpendicular to the plane MN. Bat even in this&nbsp;cafe it would be extremely difficult to determine how&nbsp;much of the fluid will go in the direction EKG, and&nbsp;what will go in the path FLH, and to aſcertain the&nbsp;form of each filament, and the velocity in its different&nbsp;points. But in the real ſtate of the caſe, the water&nbsp;will diffipate from the centre C on every ſide ; and we&nbsp;cannot tell in what proportions. Let us however eon-ſider a little what happens in the plane of the figure,&nbsp;and ſuppofe that all the water goes either in the courſe&nbsp;EKG or in the courſe FLH. Let the quantities of&nbsp;water which take theſe two eourfes have the proportions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font4"> aud <sup>π</sup>.

<p><span class="font4">But there remains a preſſure in the direction- perpendicular to the axis of the veiu, which is not balanced, as in the former caſe, by the equality on oppofite ſides&nbsp;ot the axis.

<p><span class="font4">Thus, ſrom this caſe, which is much ſimpler than can happen in nature, teeing that there will always be&nbsp;a lateral efflux, the determination of the impulſe is as&nbsp;uncertain and vague </span><span class="font3">as it was </span><span class="font4">ſure and preciſe in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">former cate.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font4">It is therefore without proper authority that the abfolute impulſe of a vein of fluid on a plane which re-ceives it wholly, is afferted to be proportional to the&nbsp;fine of incidence. If indeed we fuppoſe the velocity&nbsp;in G and H are equal to that at A, then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">b-β<sub>t</sub> z=a,</span><span class="font4"> and&nbsp;the whole impulſe is 2aV<sup>z</sup> 1—&lt;<sup>z</sup>, as is commonly ſup-poted. But this cannot be. Both the velocity and&nbsp;quantity at H are leſs than thote at G. Nay, frequent-ly there is no efflux on the fide H when the obliquity&nbsp;is very great, we may conclude in general, that the&nbsp;oblique impulte will always bear to the direct impulſe&nbsp;a greater proportion than that of the fine of incidence&nbsp;to radius. If the whole water eſcapes at G, and none&nbsp;goes off laterally, the preſſure will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2a+2ac—2bcX,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 —Λ The experiments of the Abbé Boſſut ſhow in the plaineſt manner that the preſſure of a vein, ſtriking obliquely on a plane which receives it wholly, diminiſhes faſter than in the ratio of the ſquare of the&nbsp;fine of incidence ; whereas, when the oblique plane is&nbsp;wholly immerted in the ſtream, the impulfe is much&nbsp;greater than in this proportion, and in great obliquities is nearly as the fiue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor will this propoſition determine the impulfe of </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font4">fiuid on a plane wholly immerted in it, even when the&nbsp;impulfe is perpendicular to the plane. The circumſtance is now wanting on which we can eſtabliſh a&nbsp;calculation, namely, the angle of final deflection. Could&nbsp;this be afcertained for each filament, and the velocity&nbsp;of the filament, the principles are completely adequate&nbsp;to an accurate folution of the problem. In the experiments which we mentioned to have been made under&nbsp;the inſpection of Sir Charles Knowles, a-cylinder of&nbsp;fix inches diameter was expoſcd to the action of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">ſtream moving precitely one foot per ſecond ; and when&nbsp;certain deductions were made for the water which was&nbsp;held adhering to the poſterior baſe (as will be noticed&nbsp;afterwards), the impulte was found equal to 3∣ ounces&nbsp;avoirdupois. There were 36coloured filaments diſtributed&nbsp;on the ſtream, in fuch ſituations as to give the moſt ufefal&nbsp;indications of their curvature. If was found neceſſary to&nbsp;have ſome which paſſed under the body and ſome above&nbsp;it ; for the form of theſe filaments, at the ſame diſtance&nbsp;from the axis of the cylinder, was conſiderably. different : and thoſe filaments which were ſituated in planes&nbsp;neither horizontal nor vertical took a double curvature»&nbsp;In ſhort, the curves were ail’traced with great care, and&nbsp;the deflecting forces were computed for each, and reduced to the direction of the axis ; and they were&nbsp;ſnmrned up in ſuch' a manner as to give the impuite of&nbsp;the whole ſtream. The deflections were marked as far&nbsp;a-head of the cylinder as they could be aſſuredly ob-ſerved. By this method the impulſe was computed to&nbsp;be 2J-¾∙ ounces,, differing from obtervation √<sub>δ</sub>- of an&nbsp;ounce, or about <sub>τ</sub>⅛ of the whole; a difference which&nbsp;may moſt reaſonably be afcribed to the adheſion of the&nbsp;water, which muſt be moſt ſenfible in ſuch ſmall velo-citiee. T∩ete experiments may therefore be confidered&nbsp;as giving all the confirmation that can be deſired of the&nbsp;jiiſtnefs of the principles.· This indeed hardly admits&nbsp;of a doubt :, but, alas ! it gives us but fmall’aſſiſtance ;&nbsp;for all this is empirical, in as far as it leaves us in every&nbsp;caſe the taſk of obſerving the form of the curves and&nbsp;the velocities in their different points.
