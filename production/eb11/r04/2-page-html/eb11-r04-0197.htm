<p><span class="font1">one must work with all sorts and conditions </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">men is illuminating. This statement is related by his intimate friend&nbsp;Jacob A. Riis,@@<sup>1</sup> to whom Mr Roosevelt made it in commenting&nbsp;upon his first political success in the New York legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ 1 suppose that my head was swelled. . It would not be strange if it was. I stood out for my own opinion alone. I took the&nbsp;best ‘ mugwump * stand—my own conscience, my own judgment&nbsp;were to decide in all things. I would listen to no argument, no&nbsp;advice. 1 took the isolated peak on every issue, and my associates&nbsp;left me. When 1 looked around, before the session was well under&nbsp;way, I found myself alone. 1 was absolutely deserted. The people&nbsp;didn’t understand. The men from Erie, from Suffolk, from anywhere, would not work with me. ‘ He won’t listen to anybody,’&nbsp;they said, and 1 would not. My isolated peak had become a&nbsp;valley; every bit of influence I had was gone. The things I wanted&nbsp;to do I was powerless to accomplish. I looked the ground over,&nbsp;and made up my mind that there were several other excellent people&nbsp;there, with honest opinions of the right, even though they differed&nbsp;from me. I turned in to help them, and they turned to and gave&nbsp;me a hand. And so we were able to get things done. We did not&nbsp;agree in all things, but we did in some, and those we pulled at&nbsp;together. That was my first lesson in real polities. It is just this:&nbsp;if you are cast on </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">desert island with only a screw-driver, a hatchet&nbsp;and a chisel to make a boat with, why, go make the best one you can.&nbsp;It would be better if you had a saw, but. you haven’t. So with&nbsp;men. Here is my friend in Congress who is a good man, a strong&nbsp;man, but cannot be made to believe in some things in which 1 trust.&nbsp;It is too bad that he doesn’t look at it as 1 do,, but he </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">does not,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;we have to work together as we can. There is a point, of course,&nbsp;where a man must take the isolated peak and. break with all his&nbsp;associates for clear principle: but until that time comes he must&nbsp;work, if he would be of use, with men as they are. As long as the&nbsp;good in them overbalances the evil, let him work with them for&nbsp;the best that can be obtained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his successive offices Mr Roosevelt not merely exerted a strong influence upon the immediate community, whose official&nbsp;representative he was at the time being, but by reason both of&nbsp;his forceful personality and of the often unconventional, although&nbsp;always effective, methods of work which he employed he&nbsp;achieved a national prominence out of ordinary proportion&nbsp;to the importance of his official position. His record in the&nbsp;Assembly was such that his party nominated him for the&nbsp;mayoralty of the city of New York when he was absent on his&nbsp;ranch in Dakota. Although defeated in the mayoralty election,&nbsp;his work on behalf of the merit system, as opposed to the spoils&nbsp;system of politics, was such that he was made a Civil Service&nbsp;commissioner—probably the last office a politician would wish&nbsp;to hold who desired further promotion, for the conflict which a&nbsp;Civil Service commissioner must have with members of Congress&nbsp;and other party leaders on questions of patronage is usually, or,&nbsp;at any rate, has been in the past history of American politics,&nbsp;inevitably detrimental to further official advancement. He&nbsp;was taken from the Federal service in Washington to New&nbsp;York City by a reform mayor and put in charge of the police,&nbsp;because he had shown both physical and moral courage in&nbsp;fighting corruption of all sorts; and the New York police force&nbsp;at that time was thoroughly tainted with corruption, not in its&nbsp;rank and file, but among its superior officers, who used the power&nbsp;in their hands to extort money bribes chiefly from saloonkeepers, liquor-dealers, gamblers and prostitutes. As police&nbsp;commissioner Mr Roosevelt brought to his side every honest man&nbsp;on the force. By personal detective work, that is, by visiting&nbsp;police stations at unexpected times and by making the rounds&nbsp;at night of disorderly places which were suspected of violating&nbsp;the law, he not only displayed personal courage in positions&nbsp;of some danger, but aroused public opinion. The very sensation&nbsp;created by the novelty of his methods set standards and started&nbsp;reforms which have greatly improved the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">morale</span><span class="font1"> of the entire&nbsp;force. The hopelessly vicious policemen hated him, but no man&nbsp;ever had a stronger personal hold upon the great body of the&nbsp;honest officers—a hold which existed long after he left the police&nbsp;department, and was frequently expressed by members of the force&nbsp;as he passed through the city streets. When he became assistant-secretary of the navy, his work was not so publicly conspicuous,&nbsp;but in this office he gained an experience which was of great value&nbsp;in his administration of naval affairs during his presidency. It&nbsp;is doubtful if, without the experience of this secretaryship, he&nbsp;could have successfully originated and carried out the plan of&nbsp;sending the United States navy around the world in 1907. He&nbsp;went to the Spanish War as a volunteer against the urgent&nbsp;wishes of his political advisers, and in spite of the protests of&nbsp;some of his best and most intimate friends. The conditions in&nbsp;Cuba had long convinced him that war with Spain was inevitable, and that, for humane reasons alone, it was both right and&nbsp;necessary to drive the Spanish power out from the Carribean&nbsp;Sea. Having urged this view upon the country, when war was&nbsp;declared he felt that it would be inconsistent for him not. to&nbsp;share personally in the perils of a conflict which he believed&nbsp;to be a just one, and which he had done as much as he could to&nbsp;bring about. His record in the war for efficiency and personal&nbsp;gallantry no doubt contributed largely to his nomination and&nbsp;election as governor of the state of New York; but he attained&nbsp;the governorship not on this ground alone. There arc many&nbsp;instances in American politics of nominations made solely on a&nbsp;war record which have led to hopeless defeat in election. His&nbsp;work in the governorship brought him still more into prominence&nbsp;as a national leader. His uncompromising antagonism to&nbsp;political blackmail and bribery, and his determination to pursue&nbsp;the right, as he saw the right, only in a common-sense fashion,&nbsp;made bitter enemies on the one hand among the corrupt&nbsp;politicians, and, on the other hand, among theoretical reformers,&nbsp;and discussions raged in the newspapers about his executive&nbsp;acts, his speeches, and his official messages much as they raged&nbsp;during his seven years in the White House. If he had never/&nbsp;reached the presidency he would probably have been a figure long&nbsp;remembered in American political life. But it was his course&nbsp;in the presidency that gave him his international reputation,&nbsp;and it is as President Roosevelt that future historians of&nbsp;American political life must chiefly discuss him.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> In a volume entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roosevelt the Citizen,</span><span class="font1"> which, while it is frankly written as the enthusiastic tribute of a personal admirer,&nbsp;may be relied upon for accuracy in its statement of historical or&nbsp;biographical facts.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Roosevelt entered the presidency definitely committed to two principles which profoundly affected his course as chief&nbsp;executive of the United States. He had a well wrought-out&nbsp;belief in centralized authority in government and a passionate&nbsp;hatred of political and commercial corruption. He believed&nbsp;the United States to be a unified republic, a sovereign nation,&nbsp;and not a federation of independent states united only for&nbsp;mutual benefit and protection. He not only hated corruption&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per se,</span><span class="font1"> but he clearly saw that as efficiency has a greater&nbsp;power for good, so corruption has a greater power for&nbsp;evil in a strongly centralized government. He understood that&nbsp;political materialism, selfishness and corruption in federal&nbsp;administration afford the strongest possible argument for those&nbsp;who advocate strengthening the independent power of the&nbsp;separate states at the expense of nationalism. At the very&nbsp;outset of his administration he therefore set himself to work, not&nbsp;only to improve the personnel of the government service, but by&nbsp;exhortations in his messages and public speeches to arouse a&nbsp;sense of civic responsibility both among office-holders and among&nbsp;all the citizens. His official messages to Congress, probably&nbsp;more frequent, certainly much longer than those of any of his&nbsp;predecessors, were quite as often treatises on the moral principles&nbsp;of government as they were recommendations of specific legislative or administrative policies. The effect of his exhortations,&nbsp;as well as of his personal character and public acts, upon the&nbsp;standards and spirit of official life in the United States, was a&nbsp;pronounced one in attracting to the federal service a group of&nbsp;men who took up their work of public office with the same spirit&nbsp;of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice that actuates the military&nbsp;volunteer in time of war. No American president has done so&nbsp;much to discredit and destroy the old Jacksonian theory of&nbsp;party government that “ to the victors belong the spoils,” and&nbsp;to create confidence in the practical success as well as the moral&nbsp;desirability of a system of appointments to office which rests&nbsp;upon efficiency and merit only. Mr Roosevelt not only attacked&nbsp;dishonesty in public affairs but in private business as well,&nbsp;asserting that “ malefactors of great wealth ” endeavour to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
