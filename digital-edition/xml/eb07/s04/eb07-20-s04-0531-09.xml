 an English historian, was born at Faring ton in Cheshire, in the year 1542. He was by trade a tailor, and a freeman of the company of merchant tailors in the city of London. In 1606 he published his “ Theatre of Great Britain,” which was afterwards reprinted in folio, under the title of “ The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain.” In 1614 appeared his “ History of Great Britain;” and in 1616 he published in octavo, “ The Cloud of Witnesses, or, the Genealogies of Scripture.” These genealogies were prefixed to many editions of the English translation of the Bible; and King James gave him a patent for securing the property to him and his heirs. He had twelve sons and six daughters; and died in 1629. He was interred in the church of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, London, where a monument was erected to his memory.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
