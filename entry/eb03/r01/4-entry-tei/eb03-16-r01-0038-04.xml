<p><label>REFORM</label>
means a change from worſe to better, a • re-eſtabliſhment or revival of former neglected diſcipline, or a correction of abuſes therein. The term is much ufed in a monaſtic fenfe for the reducing an order or congregation of religious to the ancient ſeverity of the rule from which it had gradually ſwerved, or even ſor improving on the ancient rule and inſtitution itſelf, and voluntarily making it more ſevere. In this ſenſe the order of St Bernard is ſaid to be only a reform of that of St Benedict. In this country it is applied both to politics and religion, and may innocently bc applied to any endeavours to change an eſtabhſhment from worſe to better. But ſt appears at preſent to have been chiefly made a pretence for deſigns which could not fairly or ſafely be avowed.</p><p>A reform in religion and in parliament (fee Parliament) has, we know, been moſt loudly called for by men whofe religions notions are immenſely different from what has been generally reckoned Chriſtianity, and whoſe deſigns, as has been legally proved, went to the overthrow of all civil order. For infidious purpoſes like theſe, the word reform is a good cloak, eſpecially if anything can be fixed upon, either in the religion or government of the ſtate, which, with the help of exag-geration and diſtortion, can be repreſented to the weak and unthinking as extremely defective and erroneous.</p><p>The general error of theſe men ſeems to be, that ha-ving picked up a ſet of ſpeculative notions which flatter their own pride and the pridς of thoſe who liſten to them, they will allow nothing to the arguments of their opponents or the experience of mankind. They think ſo often and fo much upon their ideal reforms, that while they imagine their notions are liberal and extenſive, they become contracted beyond imagination; while their judgments, of courſe, are warped with the moſt inveterate prejudices (ſee Prejudice.) They ſee, or think they ſee, the propriety of their ſchemes ; but they ſeldom, perhaps never, reflect, that that may be true in ſpeculation or in theory which cannot poffibly be redu-ced to practice. They will not take the world as it is, and allow it to profit by the wiſdom and experience of ages ; but they will reform it according to thoſe ideas of right which they have learned from their own fpecula-tions and airy theories ; ſeldom conſidering what may be done, they are determined to do what they think ought to be done. Liberty of confcience, and liberty of action, have been claimed by them as the unalienable rights of man ; and fo we ourfelves are difpoſed to think, them : nor have we heard that in this country they have been denied to any man, or ſet of men, ſo far as has been thought conſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate, and that of the other individuals who compofe it. At the ſame time, the very ſame men heſitate not to blame, with acrimony the moſt violent, and to the utmoſt of their power to reſtrain, the actions and opinions of thoſe who with equal conviction, often on better grounds, and generally with more modeſty, differ from them.</p><p>Amidſt that exceffive ardour, too, with which they propagate their opinions, they forget the extreme dan-ger of withdrawing the attention of that part of the community, who muſt earn their bread by the ſweat oſ their brow, from their proper occupations, to the tempeſtuous fea of political debate, for which their education and mode of Iife cannot poſſibly have qualified them. It requires but very little penetration, however, to be able to fee, that it can be of no real ſervice either to the individuals themſelves, or to the community at large, in whatever light we look upon it. Intleed, to make thoſe the judges of the law, and the reformers of the legiſlature, who have all their lives been employed in manual labour, is the extreme of folly ; and yet it is what ſome men of conſiderable abilities, and from whom we had reaſon to expect better things, have more than once attempted. '1 he effect of ſuch a mode of ſeduction (and it deſerves no better name), when it ſhall become general, inſtead oſ ſerving the purpoſes of a real reform, muſt be to annihilate all civil ordcr.

<p>tisfaction is the moſt powerful check to honeſt induſtry ; and diffatisfaction and idleneſs muſt be the effect of the wanderings of ſuch men in the labyrinths of politics ; which, for uncultivated minds efpεcially,paves the wayfor every ſpecies of vice, and gradually ripens them for any wickedneſs, however atrocious. For the truth of theſe re-marks, we appeal to the hiftory of mankind from theCrea∙ tion to the preſent time : and we would ſeriouſly requeſt the <hi rend="italic">fiber friends of reform,</hi> and many ſuch, we doubt not, there are, to reflect, that in the preſent day we have more to fear from licentiouſneſs than from deſpotiſm ; from reform carried to an extreme than from the pretended attempts either of kings or miniſters to annihilate our real liberty (ſee Revolution).</p><p>It may alſo be worth their while to conſider, that times of public danger are not generally the beſt adapted to attempt changes of government ; becauſe what might ſatisfy one party would probably be thought too little by another, and diviſions at ſuch a period are moſt dangerous, when, therefore, attempts are made for reform which appear to be inconſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate, reftriétions muſt be uſed, which may by ſpecu-lative men be thought ſevere and unneceffary, but of which they themſelves are the caufes. Theſe re-ſtrictions too will be patiently ſubmitted to by the wiſer part of the community, when in more peaceable times they would neither have been thought of nor allowed.</p><p>Speculative reaſoners may ſpeak as much as they will of enlightening the minds of men, and of reform-ing government by the dictates of a refined and diΓ-paſſionate philoſophy ; but when they come to apply their notions to practice, they will either find their re-preſentations little better than empty founds, and therefore ineffectual ; or, as is more generally found to be the caſe, thoſe ſchemes which in theory appeared to be perfect, 'will in practice, when combined with the malignant and ambitious paſſions of men, lead to ruin and diſorder. The ſirſt inſtitution of government, except among the Jews, was unqueſtionably the effect of paſſion and intereft combined ; and this paſſion and this intereſt, reſtrained within due bounds, is productive of much happineſs. That government, we believe, too, will be beſt ſupported, and moſt productive of happineſs, in which the mutual paſſions and intereſts of the individuals who compoſe it are ſo equally poiſed as to ſupport one another, and to promote each the ends and ſucceſs of the other : and this by the ableſt reaſoners and the beſt men has been thought to be the caſe with the Britiſh conſtitution. If the modern favourers of reform ſhould think this an unſtable ſupport, if they will conſider the world as it ever has been, and as it is <hi rend="sub">r</hi> they will ſind it the only one we have, except religion ; and they will thence be inclined to make the beſt of it. If, after all, however, they ſhould be diſpofed to doubt the poſition, we have only further to requeſt them, with the ſincerity of men and of Chriſtians, to conſult their own breaſts, and ſerioufly to conſider the probable motives of thoſe who act with them. They will then perhaps ſee, and they ſurely ought to acknowledge, that few men have acted more according to the impulſe of paſſion, intereſt, and ambition, than thofe who have for ſome time paſt founded the toczin of reform.</p>
