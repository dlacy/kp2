By chance a servant having taught him the letters of the alphabet, there needed nothing more to discover and expand his genius. He applied himself to study, and arrived at the knowledge of the most sublime geometry and analysis, without a master, without a conductor, without any other guide but pure genius. He was author and translator of several useful works, viz. 1. A New Mathematical Dictionary, in 8vo, first printed in 1726. 2. Fluxions, in 8vo, 1730. The Direct Method is a translation from the French of De l'Hospital's “ Analyse des infiniment Petits ;” and the Inverse Method was supplied by Stone himself. 3. The Elements of Euclid, in 2 vols. 8vo, 1731. Stone was a fellow of the Royal Society, and had inserted in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. xli. p. 218) an “ Account of two species of lines of the 3d order, not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton or Mr Stirling.” In 1758 he published “ The Construction and principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments; translated from the French of Μ. Bion. In 1742 or 1743 his name was withdrawn from the list of the Royal Society ; and in his old age he appears to have been left to poverty and neglect. He survived till March or April 1768.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stone, </hi><hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> the son of a seaman, was born in the parish of Sc∞nie, Fifeshire. His father died abroad when he was but three years of age, and his mother, with her young family, was left in very narrow circumstances. Jerome having obtained the ordinary school education, reading English, writing, and arithmetic, betook himself to the business of a pedlar. He began his philological pursuits with the study of the Hebrew and Greek tongues, and made himself so far master of these, without any assistance, as to be able to interpret the Hebrew Bible and Greek Testament into English <hi rend="italic">ad aperturam libri.</hi> At this time he did not know one word of Latin. Some time afterwards, he was encouraged to prosecute his studies at the university of St Andrews; and an unexampled proficiency in every branch of literature recommended him to the esteem of the professors. Having finished his studies, he settled as schoolmaster at Dunkeld, where he died in 1757, in the 30th year of his age.</p><p>STONEHAVEN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Stonehive,</hi> a seaport town in Kincardineshire, Scotland, occupies part of the parishes of Dunnotar and Fetteresso. It is situated in a south-westerly direction from Aberdeen, from which it is distant fifteen miles. The more ancient part of the town, which was built in the reign of Charles II., stands on the south side of the Carron, and presents an appearance somewhat paltry. But on the north side of the stream some elegant streets, with a square in the centre, have risen up under the auspices of Captain Barclay of Ury, upon whose ground they are built. Between the old and new towns there is a communication by means of a bridge. There is safe anchorage for shipping in the harbour, which is a natural basin, sheltered on the south-east by a high rock, and on the north-east by a quay, where goods can be landed with convenience and despatch. The harbour has been recently improved by the erection of a jetty. The vessels that sail out of this port are chiefly employed in the coal and lime trade, but the amount of tonnage is inconsiderable. Here many persons reside who occupy themselves in the herring-fishery ; and there was formerly employment for a number of weavers, but their trade has in a great measure deserted them. The prosperity of the place depends in some degree upon the persons connected with the sheriff court of the county, which is held here. Although the capital of Kincardineshire, Stonehaven is only a borough of barony, of which the magis</p><p>trates, who are authorized by the charter to preside in the justice of peace court, are appointed by the superior and feuars. A weekly market is held here, and also five annual fairs. In the vicinity of Stonehaven stand the parish churches of Dunnotar and Fetteresso. The town itself contains other two places of worship, one of which is an Episcopal chapel, and the other a meeting-house of the United Associated Synod. The population amounted in 1821 to 2150, and in 1831 to 2965.</p><p>STONES, in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> have been defined bodies which are insipid, not ductile, nor inflammable, nor soluble in water. For a view of the classification of stones, and of their distribution, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology.</hi></p><p>Some philosophers say that stones are vegetables ; that they grow and increase in size like a plant. This theory, we believe, was first offered to the world by Μ. Tournefort, in the year 1702, after returning from his travels in the East. It was founded on a curious fact. In surveying the labyrinth of Crete, he observed that the names which visitors bad engraved upon the rock were not formed of hollow, but of prominent letters, like basso-relievos. He supposes that these letters were at first hollowed out by knives ; that the hollows have since been filled up by the growth of the stone ; and hence he concludes that stones vegetate. We wish we were fully assured of the fact, that the letters were at first hollowed, before we attempt to account for their prominency. But even allowing the supposition to be true that they were at first hollow, we reply it is only a single fact, and that from a single fact it is altogether unphilosophical to deduce a general system. In the second place, this protuberancy of the characters is very improperly called vegetation, for it is not produced by a process in any respect like the vegetation of a plant. Vegetation supposes vessels containing fluids, and growth by expansion ; but who ever heard of vessels in a stone, of fluids moving in them, or of the different parts expanding and swelling like the branch or trunk of a tree? Even the fact which Tournefort mentions proves nothing. He does not pretend to say that the rock itself is increasing, but only that a few small hollows are filled with new stony matter, which rises a little above the surrounding surface of the rock. This matter evidently has been once liquid, and at length has congealed in the channel into which it had run. But is not this easily explained by a common process, the formation of stalactites ? When water charged with calcareous matter is exposed to the action of air, the water evaporates, and leaves the calcareous earth behind, which hardens and becomes like a stone.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hocking </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Stone,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Logan,</hi> a stone of a prodigious size, so exactly poised that it would rock or shake with the smallest force. Of these stones the ancients give us some account. Pliny says, that at Harpasa, a town of Asia, there was a rock of such a wonderful nature, that if touched with the finger it would shake, but could not be moved from its place with the whole force of the body. Ptolemy mentions a gygonian stone near the ocean, which was agitated when struck by the stalk of an asphodel, but could not be removed by a great exertion of force. The word <hi rend="italic">gygonius</hi> seems to be Celtic; for <hi rend="italic">gwingog</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">motitans, </hi>the rocking stone.</p><p>Many rocking stones are to be found in different parts of this island ; some natural, others artificial, or placed in their position by human art. In the parish of St Lcven, Cornwall, there is a promontory called <hi rend="italic">Castle Treryn.</hi> On the western side of the middle group, near the top, lies a very large stone, so evenly poised that any hand may move it from one side to another ; yet it is so fixed on its base that no lever nor any mechanical force can remove it from its present situation. It is called the <hi rend="italic">Logan-stone,</hi> and is at such a height from the ground that no person can believe that it was raised to its present position by art.
