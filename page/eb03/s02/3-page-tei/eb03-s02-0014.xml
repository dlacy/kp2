            <p>the 24th year of his age. His youth, his virtue, his magnanimity, and his ſufferings,
                all operated in his favour with the people. To Alexander Campbell, who inſulted him
                at the ſtake, he objected his treachery, and cited him to anſwer for his behaviour
                before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt. And this perſecutor, a few days after, being
                ſeized with a frenzy, and dying in that condition, it was believed with the greater
                ſincerity and confidence, that Mr Hamilton was an innocent man and a true
                martyr.</p>
            <p>A deed ſo affecting, from its novelty and in its circumſtances, excited throughout
                the kingdom an univerſal curioſity and indignation. Minute and particular inquiries
                were made into the tenets of Mr Hamilton. Converts to the new opinions were
                multiplying in every quarter, and a partiality to them began to prevail even among
                the Romiſh clergy themſelves. Alexander Seton, the king’s confeſſor, took the
                liberty to inveigh againſt the errors and abuſes of Popery; to neglect, in his
                diſcourſes, all mention of purgatory, and pilgrimages, and ſaints; and to recommend
                the doctrines of the reformed. What he taught was impugned; and his boldneſs riſing
                with contradiction, he defended warmly his opinions, and even ventured to affirm,
                that in Scotland there were no true and faithful biſhops, if a judgement of men in
                this ſtation is to be formed from the virtues which St Paul has required of them. A
                ſarcaſm ſo juſt, and ſo daring, inflamed the whole body of the prelacy with
                reſentment. They ſtudied to compaſs his deſtruction; and, as Mr Seton had given
                offence to the king, whom he had exhorted to a greater purity of life, they
                flattered themſelves with the hope of conducting him to the ſtake; but, being
                apprehenſive of danger, he made his eſcape into England.</p>
            <p>In 1533, Henry Foreſt, abenedictine friar, who diſcovered a propenſity to the
                reformed doctrines, was not ſo fortunate. After having been imprisoned for ſome time
                in the tower of St Andrew’s, he was brought to his trial, condemned, and led out to
                the flames. He had ſaid, that Mr Hamilton was a pious man, and a martyr; and that
                the tenets for which he ſuffered might be vindicated. This guilt was aggravated by
                the diſcovery that friar Foreſt was in poſſeſſion of a New Teſtament in the Engliſh
                language; for the prieſts eſteemed a careful attention to the Scriptures to be an
                infallible ſymptom of hereſy. A cruelty ſo repugnant to the common ſenſe and
                feelings of mankind, while it pleaſed the inſolent pride of the eccleſiaſtics, was
                destroying their importance, and exciting a general diſpoſition in the people to
                adopt in the fulleſt latitude the principles and ſentiments of the reformed.</p>
            <p>The following year, James Beaton archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, though remarkable for
                prudence and moderation, was overawed by his nephew and coadjutor David Beaton, and
                by the clergy. In his own perſon, or by commiſſion granted by him, persecutions were
                carried on with violence. Many were driven into baniſhment, and many were forced to
                acknowledge what they did not believe. The more ſtrenuous and reſolute were
                delivered over to puniſhiment. Among theſe were two private gentlemen, Norman
                Gourlay and David Straton. They were tried at Holyroodhouſe before the biſhop of
                Roſs; and refuſing to recant, were condemned. King James, who was preſent, appeared
                exceedingly ſolicitous that they ſhould recant their opinions; and David Straton,
                upon being adjudged to the fire, having begged for his mercy, was about to receive
                it, when the prieſts proudly pronounced, that the grace of the ſovereign could not
                be extended to a criminal whom their law and determination had doomed to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>A few years after, the biſhops having aſſembled at Edinburgh, two Dominican friars,
                Killor and Beverage, with Sir Duncan Sympſon a prieſt, Robert Forreſter a gentleman
                of Stirling, and Thomas Forreſt vicar of Dolour in Perthſhire, were condemned to be
                conſumed in the ſame fire.</p>
            <p>At Glaſgow, a ſimilar ſcene was acted in 1539 s Hieronymus Ruffel a gray-friar, and a
                young gentleman of the name of Kennedy, were accuſed of hereſy before the biſhop of
                that fee. Ruffel, when brought to the ſtake, diſplaying a deliberate demeanour,
                reaſoned gravely with his accuſers, and was only anſwered with reproaches. Mr
                Kennedy, who was not yet 18 years of age, ſeemed diſpoſed to diſavow his opinions,
                and to ſink under the weight of a cruel affliction; but the exhortation and example
                of Ruffel awakening his courage, his mind aſſumed a firmneſs and conſtancy, his
                countenance became cheerful, and he exclaimed with a joyful voice, “Now, I defy
                thee, Death; I praiſe my God, I am ready.”</p>
            <p>James Beaton, the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, having died about this time, the
                ambition of David Beaton, his coadjutor, was gratiſied in the fulleſt manner. He had
                before been created a cardinal of the Roman church, and he was now advanced into the
                poſſeſſion of the primacy of Scotland. No Scottiſh eccleſiaſtic had been ever
                inveſted with greater authority; and the reformers had every thing to fear from ſo
                formidable an enemy. The natural violence of his temper had fixed itſelf in an
                overbearing inſolence, from the ſucceſs which had attended him. His youth had been
                paſſed in ſcenes of policy and intrigue, which, while they communicated to him
                addreſs and the knowledge of men, corrupted altogether the ſimplicity and candour of
                his mind. He was dark, deſigning, and artificial.’ No principles of juſtice were any
                bar to his ſchemes; nor did his heart open to any impreſſions of pity. His ruling
                paſſion was an inordinate love of power; and the fupport of his conſequence
                depending alone upon the church of Rome, he was animated to maintain its
                ſuperſtitions with the warmeſt zeal. He ſeemed to take a delight in peridiouſneſs
                and diſſimulation: he had no religion; and he was ſtained with an inhuman
                cruelty,</p>
