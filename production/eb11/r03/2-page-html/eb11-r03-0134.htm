                scarlet. Clark (p. 138) gives as evidence “ Stokys<sup>i</sup> picture ”&nbsp;in the

                the clergy&nbsp;and others, it having become customary by the beginning of
                the&nbsp;16th century for Regent Masters to wear the tabard at lectures&nbsp;as more

        <p><span class="font0">The Hood was originally worn by all scholars, as by everybody, and
