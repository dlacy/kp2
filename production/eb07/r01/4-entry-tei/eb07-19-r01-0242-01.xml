<p><label>RIGA</label>
a city of the province of Livonia, a part of the Russian empire in Europe. It is the capital of a circle of the same name as well as of the province. The circle extends over 4180 square miles, and contains, in two cities, one market-town, and thirty-nine parishes, about 150,000 inhabitants. The city of Riga, called in the language of Esthonia <hi rend="italic">Riolin,</hi> and in that of Livonia <hi rend="italic">Righo,</hi> is situated on the right bank of the river Duna or Dwina, about seven miles from its entrance into the Baltic. As a barrier on the western frontier of Russia, it is strongly fortified, both on the land and the sea side. It is composed of large old houses, and of narrow crooked streets ill paved. The principal public buildings are the palace of the governor, the barracks, and the town-hall, used now as the exchange. It contains 1240 private dwellings, with about 30,000 inhabitants, exclusive of the garrison. The people are mostly of the German race, and their language is far more common than that of Russia or of Livonia. The Germans have four Lutheran and one reformed church ; and there are three Greek churches for the Russians and the troops. The city formerly was one of the Hanse Towns, and has now considerable export trade in the raw materials which are produced in the extended districts through which the river passes. At some seasons England draws much corn from this place. It has some considerable establishments for making leather, sail-cloth, linen, and some iron, steel, and other metallic articles. It imports large quantities of fruit, beer, wine, salt, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, and manufactured clothing. It has several institutions for education, and many for the relief of poverty, age, aud sickness. Long. 23. 57. 10. E. Lat. 56. 56. 32. N.</p>
