<p><span class="font1">of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus militare</span><span class="font1"> (as it is sometimes called) were the military testament and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">castrense peculium.</span><span class="font1"> The first&nbsp;set at naught all the rules of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> and the praetors’&nbsp;edict alike as to the form and substance of last wills. It&nbsp;might be in writing, by word of mouth, by the unspoken&nbsp;signs perhaps of a dying man ; all that was required was the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas</span><span class="font1"> so manifested as not to be mistaken. More extraordinary still,—it was sustained even though its provisions&nbsp;ran counter to the most cherished rules of the common law.&nbsp;Contrary to the maxim that no man could die partly testate&nbsp;and partly intestate, a soldier might dispose of part of his&nbsp;estate by testament and leave the rest to descend to his&nbsp;heirs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato.</span><span class="font1"> Contrary also to the maxim </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">semel&nbsp;heres semper heres,</span><span class="font1"> he might give his estate to A for life or&nbsp;for a term of years, or until the occurrence of some event,&nbsp;with remainder to B. Contrary to the general rule, a&nbsp;Latin or peregrin, or an unmarried or married but childless person, might take an inheritance or a bequest from&nbsp;a soldier as freely as could a citizen with children. His&nbsp;testament, in so far as it disposed only of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona castrensia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was not affected by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio minima.</span><span class="font1"> It was not&nbsp;invalidated by prseterition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font1"> nor could they&nbsp;challenge it because they had less under it than their&nbsp;“legitim”; nor could the instituted heir claim a Fal-cidian fourth, even though nine-tenths of the succession had&nbsp;been assigned to legatees. Finally, a later testament did&nbsp;not nullify an earlier one, if it appeared to be the intention&nbsp;of the soldier testator that they should be read together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All this is remarkable, manifesting a spirit very different from that which animated the common law of testaments. True, it was&nbsp;a principle with the jurists of the classical period that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voluntatis&nbsp;ratio</span><span class="font0"> was to be given effect to in the interpretation of testamentary&nbsp;writings ; but that was on the condition that the requirements of&nbsp;law as to form and substance had been scrupulously observed. But&nbsp;in the military testament positive rules were made to yield to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas</span><span class="font0"> in all respects : the will was almost absolutely unfettered.&nbsp;Roman law in this matter gave place to natural law. One would&nbsp;have expected the influence of so great a change to have manifested&nbsp;itself by degrees in the ordinary law of testaments ; yet it is barely&nbsp;visible. In a few points the legislation of Constantine, Theodosius&nbsp;II., and Justinian relaxed the strictness of the old rules ; but there&nbsp;was never any approach to the recognition of the complete supremacy of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas.</span><span class="font0"> In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris</span><span class="font0"> the contrast between the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">testamcntum paganum</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tcstamentum militare</span><span class="font0"> was almost as&nbsp;marked as in the days of Trajan. The latter was still a privileged&nbsp;deed, whose use was confined to a soldier actually on service, and&nbsp;which had to be replaced by a testament executed according to the&nbsp;usual forms of law within twelve months after his retirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense</span><span class="font0"> had a wider influence ; for it was the first  of a series of amendments that vastly diminished the importance of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> on its patrimonial side. It had its origin in the&nbsp;concession by Augustus to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font0"> on service of the right to&nbsp;dispose by testament of what they had acquired in the active exercise of their profession </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(quod in castris adquisierant).</span><span class="font0"> But it soon&nbsp;went much further. Confined at first to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font0"> on actual&nbsp;service, the privilege was extended by Hadrian to those who had&nbsp;obtained honourable discharge. The same emperor allowed them&nbsp;not merely to test on their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense,</span><span class="font0"> but to manumit&nbsp;slaves that formed part of it; and a little step further recognized&nbsp;their right to dispose of it onerously or gratuitously </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">By and by the range of it was extended so as to include not only&nbsp;the soldier’s pay and prize but all that had come to him, directly&nbsp;or indirectly, in connexion with his profession,—his outfit, gifts&nbsp;made to him during his service, legacies from comrades, and so on.&nbsp;All this was in a high degree subversive of the doctrines of the&nbsp;common law. It may almost be called revolutionary ; for it involved in the first place the recognition of the right of a person&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alicni juris</span><span class="font0"> to make a testament as if he were swi </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">juris,</span><span class="font0"> and in&nbsp;the second place the recognition of a separate estate in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiicsfami-lias</span><span class="font0"> which he might deal with independently of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which could not be touched by the latter’s creditors, and which he&nbsp;was not bound to collate (or bring into hotch-pot) on claiming a&nbsp;share of his father’s succession. The radical right of the parent,&nbsp;however, was rather suspended than extinguished ; for, if the&nbsp;soldier son died intestate, the right of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> revived :&nbsp;he took his son’s belongings, not as his heir appropriating an in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">heritance, but as his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> reclaiming a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>This was altered by Justinian’s 118th </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novel,</span><span class="font0"> under which a father taking any part of a deceased son’s estate did so as his heir; see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">infra,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">p. 713.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Family.—</span><span class="font0">The legislative efforts of Augustus to encourage marriage, to which persons of position showed a remarkable distaste, have already been mentioned. The relation of husband and&nbsp;wife still in law required no more for its creation than deliberate&nbsp;interchange of nuptial consent, although for one or two purposes&nbsp;the bride’s home-coming to her husband’s house was regarded as&nbsp;the criterion of completed marriage. But it was rarely accompanied with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font0"> So repugnant was such subjection to patrician&nbsp;ladies that they declined to submit to confarreate nuptials ; and so&nbsp;great consequently became the difficulty of finding persons qualified&nbsp;by confarreate birth to fill the higher priesthoods that early in the&nbsp;empire it had to be decreed that confarreation should in future be&nbsp;productive of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quoad sacra,</span><span class="font0"> and should not make the&nbsp;wife a member of her husband’s family. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manus</span><span class="font0"> by a year’s uninterrupted cohabitation was already out of date in the time of Gaius;&nbsp;and, although that by coemption was still in use in his time, it probably was quite unknown by the end of the period. Husband and&nbsp;wife therefore had their separate estates, the common establishment being maintained by the husband, with the assistance of the&nbsp;revenue of the wife’s dowry </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dos),—</span><span class="font0">an institution which received&nbsp;much attention at the hands of the jurists, and was to some extent&nbsp;regulated by statute. Divorce was unfortunately very common ; it&nbsp;was lawful even without any assignable cause ; when blame attached&nbsp;to either side, he or she suffered deprivation to some extent of the&nbsp;nuptial provisions, but there were no other penal consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not only in the case of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font0"> who had adopted a military career, but in all directions, there was manifested a tendency to place restrictions on the exercise of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas.</span><span class="font0"> This&nbsp;was due in a great degree to the hold that the doctrines of natural&nbsp;law were gaining within the Roman system, partly also to the&nbsp;fact that the emperors, having succeeded to the censorial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regimen&nbsp;morum,</span><span class="font0"> allowed it freely to influence their edicts and rescripts.&nbsp;Exposure of an infant was still allowed ; but a parent was no longer&nbsp;permitted, even in the character of household judge, to put his&nbsp;son to death ; in fact his prerogative was limited to moderate&nbsp;chastisement, the law requiring, in case of a grave offence that&nbsp;merited severer punishment, that he should hand his child over to&nbsp;the ordinary tribunal. His right of sale, in like manner, was restricted to young children, and permitted only when he was in&nbsp;great poverty and unable to maintain them, while their impignora-tion by him was prohibited under pain of banishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Except in the solitary case of a. son who was a soldier, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jmler-familias</span><span class="font0"> was still recognized as in law the owner of all the earnings and other acquisitions of his children </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> ; but the old rule&nbsp;still remained that for their civil debts he was not liable beyond&nbsp;the amount of the fund he had advanced them to deal with as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de&nbsp;facto</span><span class="font0"> their own </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(peculium profecticium),</span><span class="font0"> except when he had derived&nbsp;advantage from their contract or had expressly or by implication&nbsp;authorized them to enter into it as his agents. To the party with&nbsp;whom he had contracted a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font0"> was himself liable as fully&nbsp;as if he had been a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> with one exception, namely, when&nbsp;his debt was for borrowed money; in that case, with some very&nbsp;reasonable qualifications, it was declared by the notorious Macedonian senatusconsult (of the time of Vespasian) that the lender&nbsp;should not be entitled to recover payment, even after his borrower&nbsp;had become </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font0"> by his father’s death. Between a father and&nbsp;his emancipated son there was, and always had been, perfect freedom of contract; but so was there now between a father and his&nbsp;soldier son in any matter relating to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense,</span><span class="font0"> even&nbsp;though the son was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate.</span><span class="font0"> What is still more remarkable is&nbsp;that the new sentiment which was operating on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">admitted the possibility of natural obligation between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font0"> even in reference to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium profecticium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which, though incapable of direct enforcement by action, was yet&nbsp;to some extent recognized and given effect to indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the matter of guardianship, while the tutory of pupils was carefully tended and the law in regard to it materially amended&nbsp;during the period under review (particularly by a senatusconsult&nbsp;generally referred to as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oratio divi Sevcri,</span><span class="font0"> prohibiting alienation of the ward’s property without judicial authority), that of&nbsp;women above the age of pupilarity gradually disappeared. The&nbsp;guardianship or curatory </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(cura) of</span><span class="font0"> minors above pupilarity owed&nbsp;its institution to Marcus Aurelius. The Plsetorian law of the middle&nbsp;of the sixth century of the city had indeed imposed penalties on&nbsp;those taking undue advantage of the inexperience of minors, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">persons </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font0"> under the age of twenty-five ; and from that time&nbsp;the praetors were in the habit of appointing curators to act with&nbsp;such persons for the protection of their interests in particular&nbsp;affairs. But it was Marcus Aurelius who first made curatory a&nbsp;general permanent office, to endure in the ordinary case until the&nbsp;ward attained majority. The powers, duties, and responsibilities&nbsp;of such curators became a matter for careful and elaborate definition and regulation by the jurists, whose exposition of the law of&nbsp;guardianship, whether by tutors or curators, has found wide acceptance in modern systems of jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Succession and particularly Testamentary Trusts.— </span><span class="font0">There were far more positive changes in the law of succession than</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
