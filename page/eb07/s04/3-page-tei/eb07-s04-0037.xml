To use this lead more effectually at sea, or in deep water on the seacoast, it is usual previously to bring to the ship, in order to retard her course : the lead is then thrown as far as possible from the ship on the line of her drift, so that, as it sinks, the ship drives more perpendicularly over it. The pilot, feeling the lead strike the bottom, readily discovers the depth of the water by the mark on the line nearest its surface. The bottom of the lead being also well rubbed over with tallow, retains the distinguishing marks of the bottom, as shells, ooze, gravel, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> which naturally adhere to it. The depth of the water, and the nature of the ground, which is called the <hi rend="italic">soundings,</hi> are carefully marked in the logbook, as well to determine the distance of the place from the shore, as to correct the observations of former pilots.</p><p>SOURABAYA, a large and flourishing town of Java, on the northeastern coast, and capital of a government of the same name, subordinate to that of Java. It is situated at the mouth of a river, navigable for vessels of 100 tons one mile and a half from the seashore. The harbour is one of the most convenient in the island ; it is broad and spacious, secure against the violence of the sea and wind ; and it is mentioned by Sir Stamford Raffles, that it may be rendered impregnable to any hostile attack.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is form ed by the approaching extremities of the islands of Java and Madura, which in some places are not above eighty three fathoms distance for about ten or fifteen miles. This strait is not of easy navigation, but it is marked all along by buoys ; and is, besides, defended by strong batteries. One of these, a circular battery, has a commanding sweep across the Strait of Madura, which is narrowest there, being opposite to the southwest end of the island of that name. The eastern entrance being impassable for large ships, the batteries are still incomplete on that side ; but the north western entrance is defended by Fort Ludowyk, distant from Gressie about six, and from Point Panka about five miles. It presents, low on the water, a hundred pieces of the finest ordnance, mounted on traversing carriages, be sides some heavy mortars. The European part of the town is separated from the Chinese part, and from the native quarter, by the river ; but is connected with it by a fine drawbridge. The houses are very good, some of them elegant, particularly the newly erected country-seats of private individuals. The house of the British resident at Sim pang is a fine large building, close to the river; and near it the general hospital is unequalled in elegance and commodiousness. Sourabaya has been greatly improved within these few years, in proportion as the neighbouring town of Grossie has fallen into decay. A fine arsenal, and other extensive works, calculated for equipments on a very large scale, were formed by General Daendels at this place. Vessels are built and equipped at Sourabaya. Abundance of timber is procured from the adjoining forests, which is floated down the river that takes its rise from a large inland lake encircled with high mountains. Here is also a mint, from which silver and copper coins are issued. A new governmenthouse was begun at Sourabaya, and was designed to be a splendid edifice ; but the foundation of the front range having sunk, and endangered the building, the plan was abandoned, and that part which conti nued firm was converted into storerooms. Ships from Batavia bound to China or the Philippines generally touch for refreshments at this place, especially during the northwest monsoon. The surrounding country is fertile, and shaded by thickets of bamboos, bananas, and other shrubs. The adjacent country is remarkably populous; and the villages of the Javanese, Malays, and Chinese are so</p><p>populous that they appear to be a continuation of the town. Long. 112. 55. E.

It is one of the finest cities in China, noted for the beauty of its site, which is intersected by rivers and canals, and is compared by Europeans to Venice. This city is celebrated as an emporium of pleasure, and supplies the country with the choicest ropedancers, jugglers, and the best actors ; is famed for the beauty of its females ; and is, in consequence, the residence of great numbers of the rich and voluptuous Chinese. The walls are more than four leagues in compass ; and the suburbs extend along the canal, which is everywhere crowded with large barks, that afford a permanent residence to many of the inhabitants. It has an extensive manufacture of brocade and embroidery ; and, from the continual bustle and crowds in the streets, it has the appearance of a great centre of trade. Long. 120. E. Lat. 31. 22.

He was educated at Westminster school, and afterwards in ChristChurch College, Oxford. In 1654, he wrote a copy of Latin verses to congratulate Cromwell upon the peace concluded with the Dutch ; and the next year a Latin poem, entitled <hi rend="italic">Musica Incantans.</hi> In 1660, he was elected public orator of the university ; and the following year became domestic chaplain to Edward earl of Clarendon, lord high chancellor of England. In 1663 he was installed prebendary of Westminster, admitted to the degree of D. D., and had a sinecure in Wales bestowed on him by his patron, the earl of Clarendon; after whose retirement into France in 1667, he became chaplain to the duke of York. In 1670 he was installed canon of ChristChurch ; and in 1676 attended as chaplain to Laurence Hyde, Esq. ambassador extra ordinary to the king of Poland. In 1678 he was presented to the rectory of Islip in Oxfordshire; and in 1680 rebuilt the chancel of that church, as he afterwards did the rectoryhouse belonging to it. After the revolution he took the oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary, though he excused himself from accepting a great dignity in the church, vacated by the personal refusal of that oath. His health began to decline several years before his death, which happened in 1716. He was interred in Westminster Abbey, where a monument is erected to his memory. He published, 1. Animadversions on Dr Sherlock’s Vindication of the Holy and ever Blessed Trinity ; 2. A Defence of his Animadversions ; 3. Ser mons, 8 vols. 8vo. And after his decease were published his <hi rend="italic">Opera Posthuma Latina,</hi> and his posthumous English Works.
