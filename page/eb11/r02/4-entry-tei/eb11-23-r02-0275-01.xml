<p><label>RHYMNEY</label>
an urban district in the western parliamentary division of Monmouthshire, England, on the borders of Glamorganshire, 22 m. N. by W. of Cardiff, on the Rhymney, the London &amp; North-Western, and the Brecon &amp; Merthyr railways. Pop. (1901), 7915. The Rhymney river, in the upper valley of which this town lies, forms almost throughout its course, to the estuary of the Severn near Cardiff, the boundary between England and Wales (Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire).</p><p>In its upper part the valley, like others adjacent and parallel to it, is populous with mining townships, and the town of Rhymney owes its importance to the neighbouring coal-mines and to its iron and steel works, which employ nearly the whole population. The works of the Rhymney Iron Company, including blast furnaces and rolling mills, are among the largest of the kind in England.</p>
