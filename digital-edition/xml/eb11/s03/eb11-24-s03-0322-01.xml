In 1808 he obtained a post in the military college, Great Marlow, and three years later he was appointed professor of drawing in the naval college, Portsmouth, where he had ample opportunities for the study of his favourite marine subjects. From 1836 to 1855 he held a similar professorship in the military college, Addiscombe.
