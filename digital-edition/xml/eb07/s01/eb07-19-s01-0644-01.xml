or <hi rend="smallcaps">Santiponce,</hi> a town of Spain, in the division of Andalusia and government of Seville, about five miles from that city, situated on the right bank of the river Guadiana. It is celebrated for its antiquity, having been the seat of the old Roman Italica, the city of which the Emperor Trajan was a native. The remains of Roman magnificence still visible prove it to have been a place of</p><p>considerable importance. The most remarkable object is the amphitheatre, which, though in ruins, still shows its dimensions and the plan of its original construction. It is formed of Roman bricks for the foundation, and stone benches of ten rows rising one above the other, so as to seat conveniently ten thousand spectators. The ruins of the ancient city are scattered over the fields near the amphitheatre, and abundance of coins and inscriptions are to be found. A beautiful tessellated pavement, lately discovered, has upon it figures which represent the Muses and the signs of the zodiac, the outlines of which are correct, and the colours fresh and brilliant. ' There is, or was till lately, a rich convent of St Jerome, with many hospitable monks. A very large fair is annually held at this place, and the church of the monastery has several exquisite paintings.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
