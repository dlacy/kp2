            <p>ble materials; and where they are covered with earth, ſhe has bound it together by a
                thick and firm matting of graſs, and thus ſecured it from the rains; and ſhould
                accident deprive it of this covering, ſhe takes care immediately to ſupply the
                defect. Even ſhould the earth be ſwept away together with its covering, nature has
                ſtill ſuch reſources left as frequently reſtore things to their former ſtate. Many
                kinds of moſs, one would be tempted to think, have been created for this very
                purpoſe: they take root and flouriſh almoſt upon the bare rock, and furniſh as they
                decay a ſufficient bed for ſeveral of the hardy Alpine plants. Theſe periſh in their
                turn, and others ſucceed them. The roots of the plants bind fast the earth as it
                accumulates, more plants ſpring up and ſpread wider, till by degrees the whole
                ſurface is covered with a firm coat of graſs. Even the rain, which always contains
                in it a good deal of earth, contributes ſomething to haſten the proceſs.</p>
            <p>As the vegetation of ſtone, an argument advanced by the philoſophers who ſupport the
                oppoſite theory, is now, we believe, given up by all parties, it is needleſs to take
                any farther notice of it here, (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Stone). </hi>The hypotheſis
                of M. Celſius, that water is converted into earth, has alſo ſhared the ſame fate,
                becauſe it was unſupported by experiment, and contrary to every thing that we know
                either about earth or water. It is a little extraordinary that philoſophers have
                been ſo laviſh of water as to convert it in this manner into ſtone and earth, when
                they had given it, one would think, ſufficient employment before in making new
                worlds and in confuting Moſes.</p>
            <p>As the ſea covers ſo great a portion of the globe, we ſhould, no doubt, by exploring
                its bottom, diſcover a vaſt number of intereſting particulars. Unfortunately in the
                greater part of the ocean this has hitherto been impoſſible. Part, however, has been
                examined; and the diſcoveries which this examination has produced may enable us to
                form ſome idea at leaſt of the whole. The bottom of the ſea, as might have been
                conjectured indeed beforehand, bears a great reſemblance to the ſurface of the dry
                land, being, like it, full of plains, rocks, caverns, and mountains; ſome of which
                are abrupt and almoſt perpendicular, while others riſe with a gentle declivity, and
                ſometimes tower above the water and form iſlands. Neither do the materials differ
                which compoſe the bottom of the ſea and the baſis of the dry land. If we dig to a
                conſiderable depth in any part of the earth, we uniformly meet with rock; the ſame
                thing holds in the ſea. The ſtrata, too, are of the ſame kind, diſpoſed in the ſame
                manner, and form indeed but one whole. The ſame kind of mineral and bituminous
                ſubſtances are alſo found interſperſed with theſe ſtrata; and it is to them probably
                that the ſea is indebted for its bitter taſte. Over theſe natural and original
                ſtrata an artificial bed has pretty generally been formed, compoſed of different
                materials in different places. It conſiſts frequently of muddy tartareous ſubſtances
                firmly cemented</p>
            <p>together, ſometimes of ſhells or coral reduced to powder, and near the mouths of
                rivers it is generally compoſed of fine ſand or gravel. The bottom of the ſea
                reſembles the land likewiſe in another particular: many freſh ſprings and even
                rivers riſe out of it, which, diſplacing the ſalt water, render the lower part of
                the ſea wherever they abound quite freſh. An inſtance of this kind occurs near Goa
                on the weſtern coaſt of Indoſtan @@*, and another @@§ in the Mediterranean ſea not
                far from Marſeilles. Theſe facts occaſioned a notion, which later experiments have
                exploded, that the ſea beyond a certain depth was always freſh.</p>
            <p>Subſtances of a very beautiful appearance are frequently brought up by the founding
                line from the bottom of the ſea. The plummet is hollowed below, and this cavity
                filled with tallow, to which ſome of the ſubſtances adhere which form the bed of the
                ocean. Theſe are generally ſand, gravel, or mud; but they are ſometimes of the
                brighteſt ſcarlet, vermilion, purple, and yellow; and ſometimes, though leſs
                frequently, they are blue, green, or white. Theſe colours are owing to a kind of
                jelly which envelopes the ſubſtances, and vaniſh entirely as ſoon as this jelly
                dries. At times, however, they aſſume the appearance of tartareous crufts, and are
                then ſo permanent, that they can be received into white wax melted and poured round
                them, and perhaps by proper care might be converted into valuable paints.</p>
            <p>Sea-water is really, as any one may convince himſelf by pouring it into a glaſs, as
                clear and tranſparent as river water. The various appearances therefore which it
                affirmes are owing to accidental cauſes, and not to any change in the water itſelf.
                The depth, or the materials which compoſe the bottom of the ſea, occaſions it to
                aſſume different colours in different places. The Arabian gulph, for inſtance, is
                ſaid to be red from the colour of the ſands which form its bed. The appearance of
                the ſea is affected too by the winds and the ſun, while the clouds that paſs over it
                communicate all their various and fleeting colours. When the ſun ſhines it is green;
                when the ſun gleams through a fog it is yellow; near the north pole it appears
                black; while in the torrid zone its colour is often brown. Sometimes the ſea aſſumes
                a luminous appearance. Sec <hi rend="smallcaps">Light, </hi>n⁰ 37.</p>
            <p>The ſea contains the greateſt quantity of ſalt in the torrid zone, where otherwiſe
                from the exceſſive heat it would be in danger of putrefaction: as we advance
                northward this quantity diminiſhes, till at the pole it nearly vaniſhes altogether.
                Under the line Lucas found that the ſea contained a ſeventh part of ſolid contents,
                conſiſting chiefly of ſea-ſalt. At Harwich he found it yielded <hi
                    rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">25</hi>th of ſea-ſalt. At
                Carlſcroon in Sweden it contains <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript"
                    >30 </hi>th part @@(B), and on the coaſt of Greenland a great deal leſs. This
                deficiency of ſalt near the poles probably contributes a good deal towards the
                prodigious quantities of ice which are met with in theſe ſeas;</p>
