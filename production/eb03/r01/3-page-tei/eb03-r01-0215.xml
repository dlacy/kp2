I alſo deſire to have a counſel of my own nomination.” Barrere informed him, that his two firſt requeſts were already decreed, and that the determination reſpecting the other would be made known to him in due time.</p><p>It would liave been an excefs of cruelty to refuſe a requeſt ſo reaſonable in itfelf ; it was therefore decreed that counſel ſhould be allowed to the king, and his choice fell upon M. M. Tronchet, Lamoignon Male-ſherbes, and Deſeze ; he liad previouſiy applied to M Target, who excuſed himſelf on account of his age and infirmity. On the 26th of December, the king appeared for the laſt time at the bar of the convention ; and M. Deſeze read a defence which the counfel liad prepared, and which was equally admired for tlie ſolidity of the argument and the beauty of the compoſition.</p><p>when the defence was ſiniſhed, the king aroſe, and holding a paper in his hand, pronounced in a calm manner, and with a ſirm voice, what follows : “ Citizens, you have heard my defence ; I now ſpeak to you, perhaps for the laſt time, and declare that my counſel have afferted nothing„to you but the truth ; my confcience reproaches me with nothing : 1 never was afraid of having my conduct inveſtigated ; but I obſerved with great uneaſi-neſs, that I was accuſed of giving orders for ſhedding the blood of the people on the 10th of Auguſt. The proofs I have given through my whole life of a contra-ry diſpoſition, I hoped would have ſaved me from ſucli an imputation, which I now ſolemnly declare is entire-ly groundleſs.”</p><p>The difcuffion was fatally cloſed on tlie 16th of Ja-nuary. After a fitting of near 34 hours, the puniſhment of death was awarded by a ſmall majority of the convention, and ſeveral of theſe differed in opinion from the reſt, reſpecting the time when it ſhould be inflicted; ſome contending that it ſhould not be put in execution till after the end of the war, while others propoſed to take tlie ſenſe of the people, by referring the ſentence to the primary affetnblies.</p><p>M. Deſeze then ſolemnly invoked the aſſembly in the name of his colleagues, to conſider by what a ſmall majority tlie puniſhment of death was pronounced againſt the dethroned monarch. " Do not afflict France (added this eloquent advocate) by a judgment that will appear terrible to her, when<hi rend="italic">ſtve</hi>  voices only were</p><p>VVT    T    <hi rend="sup">J</hi></p><p>prefnmed ſnfficient to carry it.” He appealed to eternal jnſtice, and ſacred humanity, to induce the convention to refer their ſentence to the tribunal of the people. “ You have either forgotten or deſtroyed (ſaid the ce-lebrated M. Tronchet) the lenity which the law allows to criminals, of requiring at leaſt <hi rend="italic">two-thirds</hi>  of the voices to conſtitute a definitive judgment,”</p><p>I'he ſentence was ordered to be executed in twenty-four hours.</p><p>The king and his family had been for ſome time kept ſeparate from each other ; but he was now allowed to ſee them, and to chooſe an eccleſiaſtic to attend him. The meeting, and, above all, the ſeparation from his family, was tender in the extreme. On Monday the 2iſt January, at eight o’clock in the morning, the unfortunate monarch was ſummoned to his fate. He afcended the ſcaſſold with a ſirm air and ſtep. Raiſing his voice, he ſaid, " Frenchmen, I die innocent ; I pardon all my enemies; and may France”—at this inſtant the inhuman Santerre ordered the drums to beat, and the executioners to perform their office, when they offered to bind his hands, he ſtarted back as if about to refill ; but recollected himfelf in a moment, and ſubmitted. when the inſtrument of death deſcended, the prieſt exclaimed, " Son of St Louis, afcend to heaven.” The bleeding head was held up, and a few of the populace ſhouted <hi rend="italic">Vive la République.</hi>  His body was interred in a grave that was ſilled up with quicklime, aud a guard placed around till it ſhould be conſumed.</p><p>Ί hus fell Louis XVI. He poſſeſſed from nature a good underſtanding, which, however, was blunted by the early indulgences of a court. He had a ſtrong ſenſe of jnſtice, and his humanity was perhaps extreme. One defect rendered his virtues of little va-lue, whieh was the poſſeffion of an irreſolute and un-ſteady character. Unambitious, and eaſily adviſed, he was without difficulty induced to change his purpoſes, efpecially by his queen, whoſe connection with the houſe oſ Auſtria had always tended to render his coun-ſels unpopular, whether he was or was not connected with the foreign invaders of his country, poſterity muſt decide ; but all men of ſenſe and moderation muſt be convinced that he was murdered by a band of ruffians. Indeed a ſentence ſo infamous, and in all reſpects un-juſt, is not to be found in the records of hiſtory. The greater part of the charges brought againſt him werc trifling. Thoſe which ſeem to be of importance re-late to conduct authorized by the conſtitution under which he acted ; and that conſtitution declared his perſon inviolable. The fevereſt puniſhment that he could incur by law, was not death, but depoſition ; and there is no doubt, that in putting him to death the French nation broke the ſocial compact which their repreſen-tatives made with him. In a political view, this tragical event was injurious to the republican caufe throughout Europe. No man out of France ventured to juſti-fy it ; and in all countries it excited the moſt violent indignation againſt the rulers of tlie new republic.</p><p>New enemies were now haſtening to join the general league againſt France, we do not mean here to enter into a detail of the political ſtruggles tliat occurred in any other country, than tliat in the narrative of whoſe revolution we are now engaged. It will therefore only be neceſſary to remark in general, that the Britiſh go-verment at this time thought itſelf endangered by the propagation of thoſe ſpeculative opinions which had</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
