It was formerly a fortified town, and contained a palace and many good buildings, the greater part of which are now in ruins. It is a place of no strength, though it is enclosed by a wall and ditch. Outside the wall to the northward are several long streets of houses, mostly uninhabited. This place was conquered from the Hindus by the Bhamenee sovereigns in 1397 ; it afterwards became the capital of a small Patan state, its hereditary’ possessor receiving the title of nabob. Abdul Hakeem Khan, the seventh lineal descendant, reigned in 1792, and was tributary to Tippoo till 1784, when he accepted the protection of the Mahrattas, on which his territories were ravaged by ' the armies of Tippoo, the palaces and public buildings were destroyed and razed, and the whole country was laid waste. In 1792 it was wrested from him and restored to the nabob.
