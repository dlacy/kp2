<p><span class="font1">he was incorporated with other rescued or escaped Spaniards, in a corps equipped by the British government, and was sent&nbsp;to Spain in 1814. He continued in service as a military officer,&nbsp;and was commandant of the second battalion of the regiment&nbsp;“ Asturias,” which formed part of the army collected at Cadiz&nbsp;to be sent to South America in 1819. Service in America was&nbsp;unpopular with the soldiers, and there was much discontent&nbsp;in the country with the government of King Ferdinand VII.&nbsp;A conspiracy was formed among the officers to use the army&nbsp;for the purpose of forcing the king to grant a constitution.&nbsp;They were betrayed by a general who at first professed to&nbsp;sympathize with them, and many were arrested. Riego was&nbsp;apparently not suspected, and he decided to act on his own&nbsp;account. On New Year’s Day 1820 he made his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pronuncia-miento</span><span class="font1"> with his regiment at the village of Cabezas de San Juan.&nbsp;He proclaimed for the constitution drawn up by the Cortes in&nbsp;1812, which was unworkable, and which the chiefs of the conspiracy did not propose to restore. He hoped to seize Cadiz,&nbsp;but it was held by a loyal officer, and for a time no popular&nbsp;movement took place. Riego now started on a revolutionary&nbsp;propaganda through Andalusia at the head of his regiment.&nbsp;The country proved hostile or at the best indifferent. His&nbsp;following gradually melted away, and he was about to flee to&nbsp;Portugal when Galicia revolted. The rebellion extended rapidly,&nbsp;and the king was compelled to yield. When the liberals were&nbsp;in possession of power they would gladly have kept Riego in a&nbsp;subordinate place. But he came to the capital, where he was&nbsp;soon the most popular spokesman of the extreme parties.&nbsp;There he discredited himself by his vanity, and shocked even&nbsp;the populace of Madrid by appearing drunk at the theatre.&nbsp;He was at last persuaded to accept the military command in&nbsp;Aragon, which he thought below his merits. He began intrigues&nbsp;and agitations. The government was strong enough to put&nbsp;him under arrest at Lérida. When the new Cortes was&nbsp;elected in 1822, he was chosen deputy for his native city Oviedo,&nbsp;and the radicals selected him as president of the chamber on&nbsp;the 17th of February 1823. The unceasing intrigues of the&nbsp;king, the incapacity of the moderate parties and the hysterical&nbsp;excitement of the mob combined to make anarchy worse daily.&nbsp;Riego was the noisiest shouter of all. When the French intervention took place, he helped to carry the king to Cadiz, and&nbsp;he fought a few unsuccessful skirmishes with the invaders.&nbsp;He was at Iast captured at a farmhouse near Arguillos in the&nbsp;province of Jaen. Unfortunately for him, he fell into the hands&nbsp;of the royalist volunteers, by whom he was carried to the capital.&nbsp;On his way he was repeatedly mobbed and had many narrow&nbsp;escapes from being torn to pieces. He was hanged at Madrid&nbsp;in the Plaza de la Cebada on the 7th of November 1823. At the&nbsp;end he professed abject repentance for his impiety and disloyalty. The popular revolutionary tune of Spain, the “ himno&nbsp;de Riego,” is named after him, and his picture is hung in the&nbsp;Cortes, but he was a poor creature, and a bad example of the&nbsp;light-headed military agitators who have caused Spain much&nbsp;misery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIEHM, EDUARD KARL AUGUST (1830-1888), German</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Protestant theologian, was born at Diersburg in Baden on the 20th of December 1830. He studied theology and philology at&nbsp;Heidelberg and later at Halle under Hermann Hupfeld, who&nbsp;persuaded him to include Arabic, Syriac and Egyptian. Entering the ministry in 1853, he was made vicar at Durlach soon&nbsp;afterwards, and became a licentiate in the theological faculty at&nbsp;Heidelberg. In 1854 he was appointed garrison-preacher at&nbsp;Mannheim; and in 1858 he was licensed to lecture at Heidelberg,&nbsp;where in 1861 he was made professor extraordinarius. In 1862&nbsp;he obtained a similar post at Halle, and in 1866 was promoted&nbsp;to the rank of professor Ordinarius. Throughout his life he&nbsp;followed Hupfeld’s pIan in his scientific treatment of the Old&nbsp;Testament—that of reconciling the results of a free criticism&nbsp;with a belief in divine revelations. His practical experience of&nbsp;pastoral work also proved of service to him when he became a&nbsp;professor of theology, for “ if there is one quality more striking&nbsp;than another in the writings of Riehm, it is that of sympathy&nbsp;with orthodox believers” (T. K. Cheyne). In 1865 Riehm was&nbsp;made a member of the commission for the revision of Luther’s&nbsp;translation of the Bible, and became one of the editors of the&nbsp;quarterly review, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theologische Studien und Kritiken.</span><span class="font1"> He died&nbsp;on the 5th of April 1888.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIEL, LOUIS (1844-1885), Canadian agitator, son of Louis Riel and Julie de Lagemaundiere, was born at St Boniface, on&nbsp;the 23rd of October 1844, according to his own account, though&nbsp;others place his birth in 1847. Though known as a half-breed,&nbsp;or Métis, and though with both Indian and Irish ancestors, his&nbsp;blood was mainly French. From JuIy 1866 he worked for two&nbsp;years at various occupations in Minnesota, returning in July 1868&nbsp;to St Vital, near St Boniface. In 1869 the transfer of the&nbsp;territorial rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company to the dominion&nbsp;of Canada gave great uneasiness to the Métis, and in October&nbsp;1869 a party led by Riel turned back at the American frontier&nbsp;the newly appointed Canadian governor; in November they&nbsp;captured Fort Garry (Winnipeg), the headquarters of the&nbsp;Company, and called a convention which passed a bill of rights.&nbsp;In December a provisional government was set up, of which&nbsp;on the 29th of December RieI was made president, and which&nbsp;defeated two attacks made on it by the English-speaking&nbsp;settlers of the vicinity. So far the Métis had been within their&nbsp;rights, but Riel was flighty, vain and mysticaI, and his judicial&nbsp;murder on the 4th of March 1870 of Thomas Scott, an Orangeman from Ontario, roused against him the whole of English-speaking Canada. An expedition was equipped and sent out&nbsp;under Colonel Garnet, later Lord, WoIseley, which captured&nbsp;Fort Garry on the 24th of August 1870, Riel decamping. (See&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Strathcona, Lord.)</span><span class="font1"> He was not arrested, and on the 4th of&nbsp;August 1871 urged his countrymen to combine with the Canadians against a threatened attack from American Fenians, for&nbsp;which good service he was publicly thanked by the lieutenant-governor. In 1872 for religious reasons he changed his name to&nbsp;Louis David Riel. In October 1873 he became member of the&nbsp;Dominion parliament for Provencher, came to Ottawa and took&nbsp;the oath, but did not sit. On the 16th of April 1874 he was&nbsp;expelled the House, but in September was again elected for&nbsp;Provencher; on the 10th of February 1875 he was outlawed, and&nbsp;the seat thereby again vacated. In 1877-78 he was for over a year&nbsp;a patient in the Beauport asylum for the insane, but from 1879&nbsp;to 1884 he lived quietly in Montana, where in 1881 he married&nbsp;Marguerite Bellimeure. In 1884 in response to a deputation&nbsp;from the Métis, who had moved west to the forks of the Saskatchewan river, he returned to Canada to win redress for their&nbsp;wrongs. His own rashness and the ineptitude of Canadian&nbsp;politicians and officials brought on a rising, which was crushed&nbsp;after some hard fighting, and on the 15th of May 1885 Riel&nbsp;surrendered. He was imprisoned at Regina, was tried and on&nbsp;the ist of August found guilty of treason, and on the 16th of&nbsp;November was hanged at Regina, meeting his fate with courage.&nbsp;His death was the signal for a fierce outburst of racialism in&nbsp;Quebec and Ontario, which nearly overthrew the Conservative&nbsp;government of the Dominion.</span></p>
