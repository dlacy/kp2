<p><label>RUTHERFORD, MARK</label>
the pen-name of William Hale White, English author, who was born at Bedford about 1830. His father, William White, a member of the nonconformist community of the Bunyan Meeting, removed to London, where he was well known as a doorkeeper of the House of Commons; he wrote sketches of parliamentary life for the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Times,</hi> papers afterwards collected by his son as <hi rend="italic">The Inner Life of the House of Commons</hi> (1897). The son was educated for the Congregational ministry, but the development of his views prevented his taking up that career, and he became a clerk in the admiralty. He had already served an apprenticeship to journalism before he made his name as a novelist by th£ three books “ edited by Reuben Shapcott/’ <hi rend="italic">The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford</hi> (1881), <hi rend="italic">Mark Rutherford’s Deliverance</hi> (1885), and <hi rend="italic">The Revolution in Tanner’s Lane</hi> (1887). Under his own name he translated Spinoza’s <hi rend="italic">Ethic</hi> (1883). Later books are <hi rend="italic">Miriam’s Schooling, and other Papers</hi> (1890), <hi rend="italic">Catherine Furze</hi> (2 vols., 1893), <hi rend="italic">Clara Hopgood</hi> (1896), <hi rend="italic">Pages from a Journal, with other Papers</hi> (1900), and <hi rend="italic">John Bunyan</hi> (1905). Though for a long time little appreciated by the public, his novels— particularly the earlier ones—have a power and style which must always give his works a place of their own in the literary history of their time.</p>
