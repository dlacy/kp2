<p><span class="font0">intercourse and business of life, gave a greater impulse to comedy than to tragedy. Nsevius tried to use the theatre,&nbsp;as it had been used by the writers of the Old Comedy of&nbsp;Athens, for the purposes of political warfare, and thus&nbsp;seems to have anticipated by a century the part played by&nbsp;Lucilius. Satiric and censorious criticism rather than a&nbsp;humorous sense of the comedy of human life and character&nbsp;was apparently the chief motive of his representation.&nbsp;But the state censorship, which in a more revolutionary&nbsp;time tolerated the free criticism of public men in works&nbsp;addressed to a select class of readers, arrested at the outset all such criticism addressed to the mass of the people&nbsp;assembled in the theatre; and Nsevius, after being imprisoned, had to retire in his old age into banishment.&nbsp;He was not only the first in point of time, and according&nbsp;to ancient testimony one of the first in point of merit,&nbsp;among the comic poets of Rome, and in spirit, though not&nbsp;in form, the earliest of the line of Roman satirists, but he&nbsp;was also the oldest of the national poets. Besides celebrating the success of Marcellus in 225 over the Gauls&nbsp;in a play called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clastidium,</span><span class="font0"> he gave the first specimen of&nbsp;the “fabula prsetexta” in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alimonium Romuli et Remi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">based on the most national of all Roman traditions. Still&nbsp;more important service was rendered by him in his long&nbsp;Saturnian poem on the First PunicWar, in which he notonly&nbsp;told the story of contemporary events but gave shape to the&nbsp;legend of the settlement of .¿Eneas in Latium,—the theme&nbsp;ultimately adopted for the great national epic of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His younger contemporary Plautus (d. 184) &quot;was the greatest comic and dramatic genius of Rome, and is still&nbsp;read as one of the great comic and dramatic writers of the&nbsp;world. He lived and wrote only to amuse his contemporaries, and thus, although more popular in his lifetime and&nbsp;more fortunate than any of the older authors in the ultimate&nbsp;survival of a large number of his works, he is less than&nbsp;any of the great writers of Rome in sympathy with either&nbsp;the serious or the caustic spirit in Roman literature. Yet&nbsp;he is the one extant witness to the humour and vivacity&nbsp;of the Italian temperament at a stage between its early&nbsp;rudeness and rigidity and its subsequent degeneracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus far Roman literature, of which the predominant characteristics are dignity, gravity, and fervour of feeling,&nbsp;and which more than any other literature aimed at fortifying and elevating the character, seemed likely to become&nbsp;a mere vehicle of amusement adapted to all classes of the&nbsp;people in their holiday mood. But a new spirit came over&nbsp;the Italian Camense in the time of Plautus, which henceforth became predominant. Roman literature ceased to&nbsp;be in close sympathy with the popular spirit, either in&nbsp;political partisanship or in ministering to general amusement, but became the expression of the ideas, sentiment,&nbsp;and culture of the aristocratic governing class. It was&nbsp;by Q. Ennius (239-169) of Calabria that a new direction&nbsp;was given to Roman literature and new and deeper springs&nbsp;of emotion were elicited from the native genius. Deriving&nbsp;from his birthplace the culture, literary and philosophical,&nbsp;of Magna Graecia, having served with distinction in the&nbsp;Roman armies, and gained the friendship of the greatest&nbsp;of the Romans living in that great age, he was of all the&nbsp;early writers most fitted to be the medium of conciliation&nbsp;between the serious genius of ancient Greece and the serious genius of Rome. Alone among the older writers he&nbsp;was endowed with the gifts of a poetical imagination and&nbsp;animated with enthusiasm for a great ideal. With the&nbsp;widest culture and knowledge among all the men of his&nbsp;generation, he had also the justest discernment of the relation of culture and knowledge to actual life and to the&nbsp;work which he had to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First among his special services to Roman literature was the fresh impulse which he gave to tragedy. He turned&nbsp;the eyes of his contemporaries from the commonplace social&nbsp;humours of later Greek life to the contemplation of the&nbsp;heroic age. But he did not thereby denationalize the&nbsp;Roman drama. He animated the heroes of early Greece&nbsp;with the martial spirit of Roman soldiers and the ideal&nbsp;magnanimity and sagacity of Roman senators, and imparted weight and dignity to the language and verse in&nbsp;which their sentiments and thoughts were expressed. Although Rome wanted creative force to add a great series&nbsp;of tragic dramas to the literature of the world, yet the&nbsp;spirit of elevation and moral authority breathed into&nbsp;tragedy by Ennius passed into the ethical and didactic&nbsp;writings and the oratory of a later time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another work, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7rdpepyov</span><span class="font0"> of his serious activity, was the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saturae,</span><span class="font0"> written in various metres, but chiefly in that&nbsp;which came nearest to the spoken language of Rome, the&nbsp;trochaic tetrameter. He thus became the inventor of a&nbsp;new form of literature ; and, if in his hands the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">satura</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;rude and indeterminate in its scope, it was a proof of the&nbsp;practical bent of his understanding that he found a vehicle&nbsp;by which to address a reading public on matters of the&nbsp;day, or on the materials of his wide reading, in a style&nbsp;not far removed from the language of common life. His&nbsp;greatest work, which made the Romans regard him as the&nbsp;father of their literature, was his epic poem, in eighteen&nbsp;books, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annales,</span><span class="font0"> in which the record of the whole&nbsp;career of Rome was unrolled with idealizing enthusiasm&nbsp;and realistic detail. The idea which inspired Ennius was&nbsp;ultimately realized in both the national epic of Virgil and&nbsp;the national history of Livy. And the metrical vehicle&nbsp;which he conceived as the only one adequate to his great&nbsp;theme was a rude experiment, which was ultimately developed into “ the stateliest metre ever moulded by the&nbsp;lips of man.” Even as a grammarian he performed an&nbsp;important service to the literary language of Rome, by&nbsp;fixing its prosody and arresting the tendency to decay in&nbsp;its final syllables. Although we know his writings only&nbsp;in fragments, these fragments are enough, along with what&nbsp;we know of him from ancient testimony, to justify us in&nbsp;regarding him as the most important among the makers&nbsp;of Roman literature,—the most important indeed among&nbsp;Roman authors before the age of Cicero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is still one other name belonging partly to this, partly to the next generation to be added to those of the&nbsp;men of original force of mind and character who created&nbsp;Roman literature, that of M. Porcius Cato (234-149),&nbsp;the younger contemporary of Ennius. More than Nsevius&nbsp;and Plautus he represented the pure native element in&nbsp;that literature, the mind and character of Latium, the&nbsp;plebeian pugnacity, which was one of the great forces in the&nbsp;Roman state. He had no poetic imagination, and set&nbsp;himself in antagonism to the literature of imagination&nbsp;created by Ennius. He strove to make literature ancillary&nbsp;to politics and to objects of practical utility, and thus&nbsp;started prose literature on the main lines which it afterwards followed. Through his industry and vigorous&nbsp;understanding he gave a great impulse to the creation of&nbsp;Roman oratory, history, and systematic didactic writing.&nbsp;He was one of the first to publish his speeches and thus&nbsp;to bring them into the domain of literature. Cicero speaks&nbsp;of 150 of these speeches as extant in his day. He praises&nbsp;them for their acuteness, their wit, their conciseness. He&nbsp;speaks with emphasis of the impressiveness of Cato’s&nbsp;eulogy and the satiric bitterness of his invective. As an&nbsp;orator he seems to have been akin in spirit to Nsevius&nbsp;and Lucilius, and to the last genuine representative of&nbsp;the native temper in literature, the satirist Juvenal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Porcius Cato also heads the roll of the Roman historians, at least of those whose works were ranked as literature.&nbsp;His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Origines,</span><span class="font0"> the work of his old age, was written with</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
