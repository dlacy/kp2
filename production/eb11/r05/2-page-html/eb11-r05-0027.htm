<p><span class="font0">ROWEL (from 0. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouel</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roel,</span><span class="font0"> dim. of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roue,</span><span class="font0"> Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rota, </span><span class="font0">wheel), the name of the small revolving wheel or disk with&nbsp;radiating points forming the termination of a rider’s spur.&nbsp;The earliest rowels probably did not revolve but were fixed. <sub>s&nbsp;</sub>They appear on monuments of the 13th century, as in the&nbsp;great seal of Henry III. of England, but the older “ prick ”&nbsp;spurs remained the standard form till the 14th century (sec&nbsp;Spur). In veterinary science, the word is used of a small&nbsp;disk of leather or other material used as a seton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROWING (O. Eng. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rowan,</span><span class="font0"> to row, cf. Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">remus,</span><span class="font0"> Gr. êperpés, oar), the act of driving forward or propelling a boat (ç.fl.) along&nbsp;the surface of the wafer by means of oars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span><span class="font0">—The earliest historical records describe battles and voyages in which the ships were propelled by oars. 'There&nbsp;must, of course, have been from time to time friendly trials&nbsp;of speed between these ancient craft, such as that described by&nbsp;Virgil in the fifth book of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid,</span><span class="font0"> but there is no record&nbsp;in classical or even in medieval times of rowing having been&nbsp;indulged in solely as a recreation, or as a means of promoting&nbsp;athletic contest. The absence of any element of competition&nbsp;is sufficient to account for the fact that the boats, the oars,&nbsp;and the method of rowing of the 17th century differed but&nbsp;little from those of the earliest times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of Great Britain abounds in instances of the use of the oar. The ancient Britons propelled themselves in&nbsp;coracles of wickerwork covered with skins, by means of paddles&nbsp;rather than oars, but the Saxons were expert oarsmen, as also&nbsp;werë the Danish and Norwegian invaders. It is recorded by&nbsp;William of Malmesbury that Edgar the Peaceable was rowed&nbsp;in state on the river Dee by eight tributary kings, himself&nbsp;acting as coxswain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the nth and 12th centuries, when roads were often impassable, considerable use was made of the various rivers&nbsp;of England for the transmission of both passengers and merchandise; and, until the introduction of coaches, the nobility&nbsp;and gentry who had mansions and watergates on the banks&nbsp;of the Thames relied almost entirely upon their boats and&nbsp;elaborately fitted barges as a means of conveyance from place&nbsp;to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This use of boats and barges as a means of conveyance for merchandise and passengers provided a means of livelihood&nbsp;for a class of professional oarsmen known as bargemen or watermen. They were professionals, not in the sense of professional&nbsp;athletes, but because they made their living by rowing and&nbsp;navigating passenger and other craft along and across the&nbsp;Thames. Watermen as a class are mentioned in history as&nbsp;early as the 13th century. The distress occasioned to them&nbsp;by the long frosts is referred to in the chronicles of that period.&nbsp;They are mentioned as having been employed to row the&nbsp;barons and their retinues to Runnymede for the signing&nbsp;of the Magna Carta by King John, and about the same time&nbsp;several of the city companies established barges for the purposes of processions and other pageants upon the Thames. It&nbsp;is stated by Fabian that in r454 “ Sir John Norman, then&nbsp;lord mayor of London, built a noble barge at his own expense&nbsp;and was rowed by watermen with silver oars, attended by&nbsp;such of the city companies as possessed barges, in a splendid&nbsp;manner.” The lord mayor’s procession by water to Westminster was annual until 1856, the state barge of the lord&nbsp;mayor being a magnificent species of shallop rowed by watermen, while those of the city companies were propelled by a&nbsp;double bank of oars in the fore half, the after part consisting&nbsp;of a cabin which somewhat resembled that of a gondola. In&nbsp;1514 and in 1555 acts of parliament were passed for the regulation of watermen and their boats and fares upon the Thames&nbsp;(7 Henry VIII. cap. vii. and 2 and 3 Ph. &amp; Mar. cap. xvi.), and&nbsp;from the terms of these statutes there can be no doubt that&nbsp;there were in the 15th century a considerable body of men&nbsp;who lived by the “ trade of Rowing ” as it is there called.&nbsp;During the 16th and 17th centuries there were no doubt competitions from time to time between these watermen, but the&nbsp;first actual mention of boat-racing is the record of the establishment in 1715 of Doggett’s Coat and Badge. Mr Thomas&nbsp;Doggett, who may fairly be described as the founder of modern&nbsp;boat-racing, was a celebrated comedian. He established a&nbsp;fund to provide an annual prize of a waterman’s coat with&nbsp;a large silver badge on the arm. The race was founded in&nbsp;honour of the house of Hanover and to commemorate the&nbsp;anniversary of “ King George I.’s happy accession to the throne&nbsp;of Great Britain.” The contest was to take place at the beginning of August and on the Thames between six young&nbsp;watermen who were not to have exceeded the time of their&nbsp;apprenticeship by more than twelve months. Although the&nbsp;first race took place in 1715 the names of the winners have&nbsp;only been preserved since 1791. Doggett’s Coat and Badge&nbsp;is still an annual event, the conditions as to boats to be used&nbsp;and other details having been slightly modified. It is entirely&nbsp;controlled and managed by the Fishmongers’ Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first English regatta (Itai. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regata)</span><span class="font0">—an entertainment introduced, as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annual Register</span><span class="font0"> records, from Venice-—&nbsp;of which we have evidence, took place on the Thames off Rane-lagh Gardens in 1775. Great public interest seems to have&nbsp;been taken in the spectacular aspect of this pageant, the barges&nbsp;of the lord mayor and the city companies being present, but&nbsp;there is no record of the competing wager boats or of the names&nbsp;of the watermen who took part in the races.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About the years 1800 to 1810 there are instances of matches between watermen for stakes presented by gentlemen who&nbsp;no doubt made wagers upon the result, and from these professional wager matches it was but a short step to sporting&nbsp;matches between the gentlemen themselves. When once the&nbsp;<sup>c&lt;</sup> gentleman amateur,” as he was called, appeared, his evolution, from the sportsman who occasionally rowed a match&nbsp;against a friend, or against time, for a wager, to the amateur&nbsp;oarsman of the present day, was not slow. The amateur&nbsp;rowing which began about the year 1800 on the Thames at&nbsp;Westminster has nourished as a branch of athletic sport, and&nbsp;has spread to every quarter of the globe. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rowing in the United Kingdom,</span><span class="font0">—The earliest rowing clubs in England were small groups of oarsmen who combined to&nbsp;purchase a six-oared or eight-oared boat for the purpose of&nbsp;racing. The club was called by the same name as the ship it&nbsp;possessed, and at the commencement of the 19th century the&nbsp;principal clubs in existence upon the Thames were the “ Star,”&nbsp;the “ Arrow,” the <sup>(&lt;</sup> Shark ” and the “ Siren.” The two latter&nbsp;have long since disappeared, but the <sup>(t</sup> Star ” and the “ Arrow ”&nbsp;combined about the year 1818 and founded the Leander Club,&nbsp;an institution which after varying fortunes has for many years&nbsp;been recognized as the premier rowing club of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest contemporary record of boat-racing is the Water Ledger of Westminster School, which commences in the year&nbsp;1813 with a list of the crew of the six-oared boat “ Fly.” In 1811&nbsp;Eton had a ten-oared boat and three boats with eight oars, but&nbsp;there is no existing record of a race until 1817. In 1818 Eton&nbsp;challenged Westminster School to row from Westminster to&nbsp;Kew Bridge against the tide; but the race was stopped by the&nbsp;authorities, and it was not until 1829 that the first contest&nbsp;between the two schools took place. Between 1829 and 1847&nbsp;there were eight matches between Eton and Westminster. The&nbsp;race was revived for a few years in the sixties, and in the year&nbsp;1868 the state of the lower tideway was such that the Westminster boys moved their boathouse first to Wandsworth and&nbsp;then to Putney. This arrangement was found to be inconvenient, and shortly afterwards Westminster rowing came to an</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
