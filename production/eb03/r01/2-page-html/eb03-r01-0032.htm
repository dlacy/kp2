<p><span class="font2">of them are together, they make ſuch a horrid noiſe, that two people cannot underſtand each other’s ſpeech.&nbsp;They croak all together, and then ſtop for a little and&nbsp;begin again. It feems as if they had a captain atno∏g&nbsp;them : for when he begins to croak, all the others iol-low ; and when he ſtops, they alſo become filent. when&nbsp;this captain gives the ſignal for ſtopping, you hear a&nbsp;note like </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">poop</span><span class="font2"> coming from him. In the day-time they&nbsp;ſeldom make any great noiſe, unleſs the ſky is covered ;&nbsp;but in the night-time thcy may be heard at the diſtance&nbsp;of a mile and an half, when they croak, they are&nbsp;commonly near the ſurface of the water, under the&nbsp;buſhes, and have their heads out of the water. By going ſlowly, therefore, one may get up almoſt quite cloſe&nbsp;to<sup>3</sup> them before they go away. As ſoon as they are&nbsp;quite under water, they think themſelves fate, though it&nbsp;be ever ſo ſhallow. Theſc creatures kill and eat young&nbsp;ducklings and goſlings, and ſometimes carry off chickens&nbsp;that come too near the water ; when beaten, they cry&nbsp;out almoſt like little children. As ſoon as the air begins to grow a little cool in autumn, they hide them-felves under the mud in the bottom of ſtagnant waters,&nbsp;and lie there torpid during the winter. As ſoon as the&nbsp;weather grows mild towards ſummer, they begin to get&nbsp;out of their holes and croak. They are ſuppoſed by&nbsp;the people ofvirginia to be the purifiers of waters, and&nbsp;are reſpected as the genii of the fountains. Some of&nbsp;them were brought to England alive ſcveral years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. The bufo, or toad, is the moſt deformed and hι-deous of all animals. The body is broad ; the back flat, and covered with a pimply duſky hide ; the belly large,&nbsp;ſwagging, and ſwelling out ; the legs ſhort, and its&nbsp;pace laboured and crawling ; its retreat gloomy and&nbsp;filthy : in ſhort, its general appearance is ſuch as to&nbsp;ſtrike one with diſguſt and horror. Yet it is ſaid by&nbsp;thofe who have refolution to view it with attention,&nbsp;that its eyes are fine ; to this it ſeems that Shakeſpeare&nbsp;alludes, when he makes his Juliet remark,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some fay the lark and loathed toad change eyes;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As if they would have been better beſtowed on ſo charming a ſongſter than on this raucous reptile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Çut the hideous appearance of the toad is fuch as to make this one advantageous feature overlooked, and to&nbsp;have rendered it in all ages an object of horror, and&nbsp;the origin of moſt tremendous inventions. Ælian&nbsp;makes its venom' ſo potent, that baſiliſk-like it conveyed death by its vcry look and breath ; but Juvenal is&nbsp;content with making the Roman ladies who were weary&nbsp;of their huſhands form a potion from its entrails, in&nbsp;order to get rid of the good man. This opinion begat&nbsp;others of a more dreadful nature ; for in after-times ſu-perſtition gave it preternatural powers, and made it a&nbsp;principal ingredient in the incantations of nocturnal&nbsp;hags.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This animal was believed by ſome old writers to have a ſtone in its head fraught with great virtues medical and magical : it was diſtinguiſhed by the name&nbsp;of the reptile, and called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">toadfione, lιfοηites, era·&nbsp;paudine, kr(<sub>j</sub>ttenfictn ;</span><span class="font2"> but all its-fancied powers, vaniſh-ed on the diſcovery· of its.being nothing but the foſſil-tooth of the ſea-wolf¢, or. of ſome other flat-toothed</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fiſh, not unfrequeΛt in our iſland as well as feveral other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">But theſe fables have been long exploded. And as to the notion of its being a poifonous animal, it is pro·&nbsp;bable that its exceffive deformity, joined to the faculty&nbsp;it has of emitting a juice from its pimples, and a duſky&nbsp;liquid from its hind parts, is the foundation of the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That it has any noxious qualities there feem to have been no proofs in the fmalleſt degree fatisfactory, tho’&nbsp;we have heard many ſtrange relations on that point.—.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Οη </span><span class="font2">the contrary, there have been many who have taken&nbsp;them in their naked hands, and held them long without receiving the leaſt injury : it is alfo well known that&nbsp;quacks have eaten them, and have beſides ſqueezed&nbsp;their juices into a glaſs and drank them with impunity,&nbsp;we may ſay alſo, that tlieſe reptiles are a common&nbsp;food to many animals ; to buzzards, owls, Norfolk&nbsp;plovers, ducks, and ſnakes, who would not touch them&nbsp;were they in any degree noxious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Go far from having venomous qualitics, they have of late been confidered as if they had beneficent ones ;&nbsp;particularly in the cure of the moſt terrible of diſeaſes,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cancer,</span><span class="font2"> by ſuction : (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Britiſh Zoology,</span><span class="font2"> vol. iii.&nbsp;Append, p. 389, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etfiq.) </span><span class="font2">But, from all circumſtances,&nbsp;as Mr Pennant obſerves, they ſeem only to have ren«&nbsp;dered a horrible complaint more loathſome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The moſt full information concerning the nature and qualities of this animal is contained in the following letters from Mr Arſcott and Mr Pittfield to Dr&nbsp;Milles. &quot; It would give me great pleaſure (ſays Mr&nbsp;Arſcott) to be able to inform you of any particulars&nbsp;worthy Mr Pennant’s notice, concerning the toad who&nbsp;lived ſo many years with us, and was ſo great a favourite. Tlie greateſt curioſity in it was its becoming ſo remarkably tame. It had frequented ſome ſteps before the&nbsp;hall-door ſome years before my acquaintance commenced&nbsp;with it, and had been admired by my father for its&nbsp;ſize (which was of the largeſt I ever met with), who&nbsp;conſtantly paid it a viſit every evening. I knew it&nbsp;mylelf above 30 years ; and by conſtantly feeding it,&nbsp;brought it to be ſo tame, that it always came to the&nbsp;candle, and looked up as if expecting to be taken up&nbsp;and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with&nbsp;infects of all forts ; it was fondeſt of fleſh maggots,&nbsp;which I kept in bran ; it would follow them, and, when&nbsp;within a proper diſtance, would fix its eye, and remain&nbsp;motionlefs for near a quarter of a minute, as if preparing&nbsp;for the ſtroke, which was an inftantaneous throwing its&nbsp;tongue at a great diſtance upon the inſect, which ſtuck&nbsp;to the tip by a glutinous matter : the motion is quicker&nbsp;than the eye can follow (a).</span></p>

I was confirmed in this by never obſerving any internal motion in its mouth, excepting one&gt;&nbsp;ſwallow the inſtant its tongue returned.
