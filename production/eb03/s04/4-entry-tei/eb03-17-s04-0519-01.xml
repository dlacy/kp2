in anatomy, the dried bones of any animal joined together by wires, or by the natural ligament dried, in ſuch a manner as to show their poſition when the creature was alive.</p><p>We have, in the Philoſophſeal Tranſactions, an account of a human ſkeleton, all the bones of which were ſo united, as to make but one articulation from the back to the os ſacrum, and downwards a little way. On ſawing ſome of them, where they were unnaturally joined, they were found not to cohere throughout their whole ſubſtance, but only about a ſixth of an inch deep</p><p>all round. The figure of the trunk was crooked, the spinæ making the convex, and the inside of the vertebræ the concave part of the ſegment. The whole had been found in a charnel-houſe, and was of the ſize of a full grown perſon.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
