<p><span class="font0">Both parts of this proposition are probably true ; but he does not establish the first in a very satisfactory manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency </span><span class="font0">(1816) he first disposes of the chimera of a currency&nbsp;without a specific standard, and pronounces in favour of a&nbsp;single metal, with a preference for silver, as the standard.&nbsp;He then puts forward a scheme which had been already&nbsp;briefly indicated in the appendix to the 4th edition (1811)&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">High Price of Bullion.</span><span class="font0"> This was that the bank&nbsp;should be obliged to deliver on demand, not coin, but&nbsp;uncoined bullion or gold standard bars, in exchange for&nbsp;its notes, whenever the notes presented together for&nbsp;payment reached a moderate fixed amount. The consequence would be that, all the smaller payments being&nbsp;made in the cheap medium, paper, the country would&nbsp;enjoy the profit derivable from the metallic currency used&nbsp;as a capital ; the wear of the coinage, too, would be prevented, and a saving thus effected. By this method the&nbsp;public would secure itself against any variations in the&nbsp;value of the currency beyond those to which the standard&nbsp;itself is necessarily subject; and, at the same time, the&nbsp;circulation would be carried on in the least expensive way.&nbsp;Thus, whilst the use of the precious metals as the medium&nbsp;of exchange was, in the earlier stages of social life, one of&nbsp;the most important steps towards the improvement of&nbsp;commerce and the advancement of civilization, it is proposed to us, and on grounds which it is difficult to gainsay, to banish them once more from such employment in&nbsp;almost all the internal transactions of a country. A&nbsp;kindred revolution, tending to the further elimination of&nbsp;metallic money, Jevons has spoken of as “a return to&nbsp;barter”; but that expression is misleading, for in the&nbsp;modern system of settlement by writing off liabilities&nbsp;against each other a metallic standard is always supposed,&nbsp;and lies at the basis of every transaction, whereas in the&nbsp;primitive method of dealing commodities were directly&nbsp;compared. Ricardo’s plan was in operation for some&nbsp;time, but was then given up on the ground, urged by the&nbsp;bank, of the frequent forgery of one pound notes, and the&nbsp;consequent necessity of replacing them with coin—a very&nbsp;insufficient reason, as experience demonstrates, though&nbsp;a good argument in favour of such an improved manufacture of notes as would effectually defeat fraudulent imitation. In a later tract </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Plan for a National Bank)</span><span class="font0"> Ricardo&nbsp;proposes that one pound notes should be confined to the&nbsp;country districts. The general plan has been objected to&nbsp;on the ground that it would not provide for a sufficient&nbsp;metallic reserve to meet sudden emergencies arising from&nbsp;the necessity of foreign payments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ricardo’s chief work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1817. A full account of the&nbsp;general theory expounded in this treatise has been given&nbsp;under Political Economy ; a very brief statement must&nbsp;here suffice. The fundamental doctrine is that, on the&nbsp;hypothesis of free competition, exchange value is determined by the labour expended in production,—a proposition not new, nor, except with considerable limitation and&nbsp;explanation, true, and of little practical use, as “ amount&nbsp;of labour ” is a vague expression, and the thing intended&nbsp;is incapable of exact estimation. Ricardo’s theory of distribution has been briefly enunciated as follows:—“(1)&nbsp;the demand for food determines the margin of cultivation ;&nbsp;(2) this margin determines rent ; (3) the amount necessary&nbsp;to maintain the labourer determines wages ; (4) the difference between the amount produced by a given quantity&nbsp;of labour at the margin and the wages of that labour&nbsp;determines profit.” These theorems are too absolutely&nbsp;stated, and require much modification to adapt them&nbsp;to real life. His theory of foreign trade has been embodied in the two propositions—“(1) international values&nbsp;are not determined in the same way as domestic values ;&nbsp;(2) the medium of exchange is distributed so as to bring&nbsp;trade to the condition it would be in if it were conducted&nbsp;by barter.” His views on currency and banking will be&nbsp;gathered from the present article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A considerable portion of the work is devoted to a study of taxation, which requires to be considered as a&nbsp;part of the problem of distribution. A tax is not always&nbsp;paid by those on whom it is imposed ; it is therefore&nbsp;necessary to determine the ultimate, as distinguished&nbsp;from the immediate, incidence of every form of taxation.&nbsp;Smith had already dealt with this question ; Ricardo&nbsp;develops and criticizes his results. The conclusions at&nbsp;which he arrives are deduced from the theory of rent and&nbsp;from the assumptions of a uniform rate of profits and of a&nbsp;rate of wages coincident with the necessary subsistence of&nbsp;the labourer. They are in the main as follows :—a tax on&nbsp;raw produce falls on the consumer, but will also diminish&nbsp;profits ; a tax on rents on the landlord ; taxes on houses&nbsp;will be divided between the occupier and the ground landlord ; taxes on profits will be paid by the consumer, end&nbsp;taxes on wages by the capitalist. These propositions of&nbsp;course participate in the infirmity of the premises from&nbsp;which they are deduced, or must at least be taken with&nbsp;limitations corresponding to those to which the premises&nbsp;are subject. Ricardo adopts and even extols as a “ golden&nbsp;maxim ” the shallow dictum of Say, that “ the very best&nbsp;of all plans of finance is to spend little, and the best of all&nbsp;taxes is that which is of least amount.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1819 Ricardo, having retired from business and become a landed proprietor, entered parliament as member&nbsp;for Portarlington. He was at first diffident and embarrassed&nbsp;in speaking, but gradually overcame these difficulties, and&nbsp;was heard with much attention and deference, especially&nbsp;when he addressed the house on economic questions. He&nbsp;probably contributed in a considerable degree to bringing&nbsp;about the change of opinion on the question of free trade&nbsp;which ultimately led to the legislation of Sir Robert Peel&nbsp;on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1820 he contributed to the supplement of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ency∙ clopædia Britannica</span><span class="font0"> (6th ed.) an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Funding&nbsp;System.</span><span class="font0"> In this, besides giving an historical account&nbsp;(founded on Dr Robert Hamilton’s valuable work </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On the&nbsp;National Debt,</span><span class="font0"> 1813, 3d ed., 1818) of the several successive forms of the sinking fund, he urges that nations&nbsp;should defray their expenses, whether ordinary or extraordinary, at the time when they are incurred, instead of&nbsp;providing for them by loans ; and, not believing that the&nbsp;system of a sinking fund would ever be consistently and&nbsp;perseveringly carried out, he maintains that the national&nbsp;debt should be paid off by a tax on property—an operation&nbsp;which he thought might be completed in tw<sup>τ</sup>o or three&nbsp;years during peace. Thus, by a single effort we might,&nbsp;he says, get rid of those great sources of demoralization,&nbsp;the customs and the excise, and our commerce would be&nbsp;freed from “ all the vexatious delays and interruptions&nbsp;which our present artificial system imposes upon it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1822 he published a tract </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On Protection to Agriculture,</span><span class="font0"> which is an able application to controversy of the general principles laid down in his systematic work. Its&nbsp;arguments and conclusions are therefore subject to the&nbsp;same limitations which those fundamental principles require. He does not advocate an absolutely free importation of corn, but proposes, in consideration of the special&nbsp;burdens on agriculture, to impose on the foreign commodity&nbsp;a duty equivalent to the exclusive taxes imposed on home&nbsp;growers, as well as to allow a drawback on exportation&nbsp;equal to the duty. The only point of much interest in&nbsp;the tract, apart from the question of protection, is the&nbsp;assertion of the doctrine that a high rate of interest is</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
