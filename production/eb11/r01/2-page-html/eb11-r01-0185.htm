<p><span class="font1">destroyed by ĩenghĩz Khan in the 13th century, has the four pegs in the side of the head. Finally, we find the instrument on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">doorway of the Hôpital du Moristan@@<sup>1</sup> (Cairo), carved work of the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all these examples it is noteworthy that the strings are vibrated by plucking them with the fingers, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not by means of the bow,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the use ot which, in conjunction with those structural features,&nbsp;constitutes the violation of an acoustic principle, and therefore&nbsp;accounts for the failure </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the instrument as Rebab and its successful development as Lute. There are, however, two early examples of bowed rebabs of Byzantine origin to be cited. A pear-shaped rebab, held like a violoncello and played by means of a&nbsp;very long and slender bow, is carved on one of the reliefs of an&nbsp;ivory casket of Italo-Byzantine work of the 8th or 9th century,&nbsp;belonging to the Carrand Collection, Florence (see Rebec). Another&nbsp;bowed instrument, of still earlier date, is to be seen among the&nbsp;wonderful mural paintings of the necropolis and monastery of&nbsp;Baouît,@@2 assigned to the 8th century at the latest, but probably&nbsp;dating from the 6th or 7th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The examination of all these representations of the rebab, ranging from 1000 b.c. to the 13th century a.d., tends to show&nbsp;that the instrument had its origin in the East, and was widely&nbsp;distributed over Asia Minor, India and Persia before the 6th&nbsp;century a.d. Similar archaeological documents of the middle&nbsp;ages suggest the possibility that we are not indebted to the&nbsp;Arabs alone for the introduction of the rebab and bow and of&nbsp;the lute into Europe by way of Spain, early in the 8th century,&nbsp;but that they had probably already made their way into southern&nbsp;and central Europe from the East through the influence of the&nbsp;Byzantine Empire and of the Christian East generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is clear also that the instruments of the rebab type were at first twanged with the fingers, and the bow was apparently not&nbsp;invented for the rebab but only applied to it. All arguments in&nbsp;favour of including the rebab among the ancestors of the violin&nbsp;on the score of the bow lose their force, and as the rebab possessed&nbsp;no structural feature in common with the violin the question may&nbsp;be considered settled negatively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the European development of the rebab, see Rebec. (K. S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REBATE (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabat,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabattre,</span><span class="font2"> to beat back), a term used in commerce, banking, &amp;c. In banking, a rebate is an allowance&nbsp;made to a drawee taking up a bill of exchange before it is due.&nbsp;This allowance is the interest on the unexpired period of the bill,&nbsp;and in practice may be either a fixed or arbitrary rate; more&nbsp;often it is ½%, about the usual bank deposit rate. In&nbsp;commerce, rebate is sometimes used to mean a discount allowed&nbsp;for prompt payment; it is often equivalent to drawback, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;the repayment of part of the duty on imported goods when such&nbsp;goods are subsequently exported in their original or in another&nbsp;form. By the Customs Consolidation Act, 1853, a rebate or&nbsp;deduction is allowed at the custom-house from the fixed duties&nbsp;on certain kinds of goods, on account of damage or loss sustained&nbsp;in warehouses.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">REBEC, or Rebeck (Med. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rubèbe, rebelle, rebec, gigue; </span><span class="font2">Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rubeba, Rebek, Geige, Lyra;</span><span class="font2"> Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribeba, ribecα, lyra;</span><span class="font2"> Sp,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabel, rabeca, ravé, rabé),</span><span class="font2"> a medieval stringed instrument played&nbsp;with a bow, derived from the Oriental rebab. Like the rebab (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font2">), the rebec assumed at first one of two forms—the pear-shaped body with a wide base, strung with three strings, or the&nbsp;long, narrow pear- or boat-shaped body with two strings and, in&nbsp;addition, the other Oriental characteristics of the rebab, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;vaulted back, the absence of ribs and pegs set in the back of the&nbsp;head. Except for the addition of a fingerboard, what is now&nbsp;recognised as the rebec underwent no structural development&nbsp;and never entered the domain of art. When the guitar-fiddle&nbsp;and the oval vielle with five strings made their appearance in&nbsp;Europe, apparently during the 11th century, a number of&nbsp;hybrids combining characteristics of both types of construction&nbsp;spread rapidly over western Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A spoon-shaped instrument, in most cases without neck, the head being joined directly to the wide shoulders of the body,&nbsp;must not be confounded with these hybrids; the compass and&nbsp;capabilities of the instrument, which sometimes had but one&nbsp;single string, must have been extremely limited. What the&nbsp;name of the instrument was in the various ages is not knowm,&nbsp;but it may be classed with the rebab and rebec, from which it&nbsp;only differs in the outline of the body. The present writer&nbsp;discovered an Oriental archetype on a small terra-cotta figure@@3 in the style of the Gandhāra school, unearthed at Yōtkan on the&nbsp;site of the ancient Khotan. The round head is fastened directly&nbsp;to the shoulders, the three strings are thrown into relief by deep&nbsp;indentations, the bridge tail-piece has three notches. The&nbsp;instrument (assigned to some period between the 5th and 8th&nbsp;centuries a.d.) may be compared with the European medieval&nbsp;type, such, for instance, as the bowed spoon-shaped rebec on the&nbsp;capital of the left pillar in the miniature@@<sup>4</sup> of King David and his&nbsp;musicians, belonging to the 10th-century psalter of Labeo&nbsp;Notker at St Gallen; also with the musicians’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lyra</span><span class="font2"> on the&nbsp;western doorway of the church at Moissan;@@5 and with the&nbsp;British Museum Add, MS. 17333, in which several of these&nbsp;spoon-shaped, neckless instruments are to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pear-shaped rebec with wide base was in all probability introduced into Europe through the Byzantine Empire, and the narrow boat-shaped by the Moors by way of Spain. The first of these types&nbsp;is represented on one of the sides of an ivory casket of Italo-Byzantine workmanship preserved among the Ċarrand Collection@@6 in the Palazzo del Podesta in Florence. It belongs to the same group&nbsp;as the Veroli casket at the South Kensington Museum, all of which&nbsp;are assigned to the 9th century at the latest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pear-shaped rebec on the ivory casket, although like all rebecs ît'had no separate neck, was elongated to form one, and terminated&nbsp;in a lozenge-shaped head all in one piece with back and neck, the&nbsp;soundboard being cut to the same outline and glued to the back.&nbsp;There were four strings to these rebecs, of which there are many&nbsp;examples in English MSS. from the 11th century. One of the best&nbsp;known, sometimes described as the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fythele,</span><span class="font1"> is the one&nbsp;played by Jeduthun in the usual illustration of King David and&nbsp;his musicians prefaced to the Psalms in an Anglo-Saxon psalter&nbsp;(Cotton MS., Tib. C. VI., Brit. Mus.). Other examples are to be&nbsp;found in a Latin psalter illuminated by an English artist at the beginning of the 12th century (Lansd., 383, Brit. Mus.), in which the&nbsp;rebec has but one string and resembles the lyra teutonica mentioned&nbsp;above.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Medieval documentary evidence points to the fact that the long boat-shaped rebec had survived in Spain and spread by way of France over western Europe. The much-quoted 14th-century</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
