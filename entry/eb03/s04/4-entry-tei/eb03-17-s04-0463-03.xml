a large, ancient, and celebrated city of Tuſeany in Italy ; capital of the Sienneſe, with an archbiſhop’s ſee, a famous university, and a citadel, it is about four miles in circumference, and ſurrounded with an old wall. The metropolitan church is much eſteemed by travellers ; and though it is a Gothic structure, the architecture is admirable. It is built with black and white marble, and the pavement is of Moſaic work. The town is adorned with a great number of palaces, fountains, and ſuperb churches, as alſo a magnificent hoſpital. The great area is round, and the houles about it are of the ſame height, ſupported by piazzas, under which people may walk in hot or rainy weather ; in the middle is abaſon, which can be filled with water at any time, to repreſent a ſea-fight with ſmall vefſels. The Italian language is taught here with ſuch purity, that a great many foreigners frequent it on that account. It is ſeated on three eminences, in a fertile soil, in E. Long. 11. 11. N. Lat.43. 10.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
