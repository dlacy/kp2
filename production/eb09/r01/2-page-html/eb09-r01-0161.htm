<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as adventurous as any boy reader of his novels could desire. He was a native of Ulster, born in 1818, and was educated&nbsp;for the church, but, disliking the prospect of a regular profession, went to America at the age of twenty in search of&nbsp;excitement and fortune. Among other experiences he made&nbsp;trading excursions on the Red River, and studied the ways&nbsp;of the retiring red man and the white pioneer on the spot.&nbsp;He made acquaintance with the Missouri in the same practical manner, and roved about through all the States of the&nbsp;Union. When the war with Mexico broke out in 1845 he&nbsp;obtained a commission, was present at the siege and capture&nbsp;of Vera Cruz, and led a forlorn hope at Chapultepec. In one&nbsp;of his novels he says that he believed theoretically in the&nbsp;military value of untrained troops, and that he had found&nbsp;his theories confirmed in actual warfare. But, though he&nbsp;saw a good deal of service in America, he was disappointed&nbsp;in his plans for taking part in a conflict with the regular&nbsp;troops of a European country. An enthusiastic republican,&nbsp;he offered his services to the Hungarian insurgents in&nbsp;1849, raised a body of volunteers, and sailed for Europe,&nbsp;but arrived too late. Thereafter he settled in England,&nbsp;and began his career of a novelist in 1849 with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rifle&nbsp;Rangers.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> This was followed next year by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scalp&nbsp;Hunters.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> He never surpassed his first productions, except&nbsp;perhaps in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The White Chief</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1855) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Quadroon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1856); but he continued to produce tales of self-reliant&nbsp;enterprise and exciting adventure with great fertility.&nbsp;Simplicity of plot and easy variety of exciting incident&nbsp;are among the merits that contribute to his popularity&nbsp;with boys. His reflexions are not profound, but are&nbsp;frequently more sensible than might be presumed at first&nbsp;sight from his aggressive manner of expressing them.&nbsp;He died in London, October 22, 1883.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REID, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1710-1796), the chief founder of what is generally designated the Scottish school of philosophy, was born at Strachan in Kincardineshire, about&nbsp;20 miles from Aberdeen, on the 26th April 1710. His&nbsp;father was minister of the place for fifty years, and traced&nbsp;his descent from a long line of Presbyterian ministers on&nbsp;Deeside. His mother belonged to the brilliant family of&nbsp;the Gregorys, which gave so many representatives to&nbsp;literature and science in Scotland last century. After two&nbsp;years at the parish school of Kincardine, Thomas Reid&nbsp;entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1722. He was&nbsp;instructed in philosophy by Dr George Turnbull, in his&nbsp;day a voluminous and versatile writer, but now almost&nbsp;entirely forgotten. Turnbull’s teaching would appear,&nbsp;from the account given of it by M‘Cosh, to have anticipated and suggested certain characteristics of Reid’s subsequent theory. Reid graduated in 1726 at the early age&nbsp;of sixteen, but remained in Aberdeen as librarian to the&nbsp;university for ten years longer. This may be looked upon&nbsp;as his real student-time, and it seems to have been largely&nbsp;devoted to mathematical reading. In 1737 he was presented to the living of Newmachar near Aberdeen. The&nbsp;parishioners, being violently excited at the time about the&nbsp;law of patronage, received Reid with open hostility; and&nbsp;tradition asserts that, during the preaching of his first&nbsp;sermon, an uncle who lived near defended him on the&nbsp;pulpit stair with a drawn sword. But before he left the&nbsp;parish he was completely successful in winning the&nbsp;affections of his people. He was, however, nowise distinguished as a preacher, being accustomed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> from a distrust in his own powers,” as Stewart puts it, “ to preach&nbsp;the sermons of Dr Tillotson and of Dr Evans.” The&nbsp;greater part of his time was given to study; and, instigated by the publication of Hume’s treatise, he now&nbsp;turned his chief attention to philosophy, and in particular&nbsp;to the theory of external perception. His first publication, however, which dealt with a question of philosophical</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">method suggested by the reading of Hutcheson, was more nearly allied to his mathematical studies. The “Essay&nbsp;on Quantity, occasioned by reading a Treatise in which&nbsp;Simple and Compound Ratios are applied to Virtue and&nbsp;Merit,” denies that a mathematical treatment of moral&nbsp;subjects is possible. The essay appeared in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Royal Society for the year 1748. Before this,&nbsp;in 1740, Reid had married a cousin of his own, the&nbsp;daughter of a London physician. In 1752 the professors&nbsp;of King’s College, Aberdeen, elected him to the chair of&nbsp;philosophy, which he held for the next twelve years.&nbsp;The foundation of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society,&nbsp;which numbered among its members Campbell, Beattie,&nbsp;Gerard, and Dr John Gregory, was mainly owing to the&nbsp;exertions of Reid, who was secretary for the first year&nbsp;(1758). Many of the subjects of discussion were drawn&nbsp;from Hume’s speculations; and during the last years of&nbsp;his stay in Aberdeen Reid propounded his new point of&nbsp;view in several papers read before the society. Thus we&nbsp;find from the minutes that on the 13th and 26th of July&nbsp;1758 Mr Reid “handled” the following questions:—&nbsp;“ Are the objects of the human mind properly divided&nbsp;into impressions and ideas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> And must every idea be a&nbsp;copy of a preceding impression </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ” The reply to Hume&nbsp;which these titles foreshadow was embodied by Reid in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of&nbsp;Common Sense,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> published in 1764. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> does not&nbsp;go beyond an analysis of sense perception, and is therefore&nbsp;more limited in its scope than the later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays·,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but if&nbsp;the latter are sometimes more mature, there is more&nbsp;freshness about the earlier work. The same year saw&nbsp;Reid’s removal from Aberdeen to the professorship of&nbsp;moral philosophy in the university of Glasgow, where he&nbsp;succeeded Adam Smith. This position he continued to&nbsp;hold till 1781, when he resigned his chair in order to&nbsp;give his undivided energies to completing a systematic&nbsp;exposition of his philosophy. As a public teacher, Reid&nbsp;did not possess the eloquence and charm of manner&nbsp;which afterwards characterized both Stewart and Brown.&nbsp;Stewart’s account of his lecturing, which may be presumed to be favourable, mentions only the “silent and&nbsp;respectful attention ” which was accorded to “ the simplicity and perspicuity of his style ” and “ the gravity&nbsp;and authority of his character.” Reid’s philosophical&nbsp;influence was mainly exerted through his writings, and, at&nbsp;second hand, through the eloquent treatment which his&nbsp;doctrines received at the hands of Dugald Stewart, and&nbsp;the learning which Hamilton subsequently devoted to&nbsp;their elucidation. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays on the Intellectual Powers&nbsp;of Man</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> appeared in 1785, and their ethical complement,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in&nbsp;1788. These, with an account of Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Logic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">appended to Lord Karnes’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sketches of the History of Man&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1774), conclude the list of Avorks published in Reid’s lifetime. Hamilton’s edition of Reid also contains an account&nbsp;of the university of Glasgow and a selection of Reid’s&nbsp;letters, chiefly addressed to his Aberdeen friends the Skenes,&nbsp;to Lord Karnes, and to Dr James Gregory. With the two&nbsp;last-named he discusses the materialism of Priestley and&nbsp;the theory of necessitarianism. He reverted in his old&nbsp;age to the mathematical pursuits of his earlier years, and&nbsp;his ardour for knowledge of every kind remained fresh to&nbsp;the last. But in 1792 the serenity which marked the&nbsp;concluding years of his life AA<sup>r</sup>as clouded by the death of&nbsp;his Avife. All the children of their marriage except one&nbsp;daughter had died many years before. In other respects&nbsp;Reid’s life pursued its equable and uneventful course till&nbsp;within a few weeks of his death, which took place on the&nbsp;7th October 1796.</span></p>
