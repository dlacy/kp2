<p><span class="font1">it ready to receive him, becauſe the empty bucket is made heavier than the empty ftage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, if there be no water in the bucket, it is evident, that although the motion of the machine will be the quickeſt poſſible, there will be no work performed.&nbsp;On the other hand, if the loaded ſtage and the full&nbsp;bucket are of equal weight, which is the uſual ſtatc-rnent of ſuch a machine in elementary treatiſes of mechanics, the machine will ſtand ſtill, and no work will be&nbsp;performed. In every intermediate ſtate of things thc&nbsp;machine will move, and work will be performed. Therefore the different values of the work performed muſt be a&nbsp;ſeries of quantities which increaſe from nothing to a&nbsp;certain magnitude, and then diminiſh to nothing again.&nbsp;The maxim which is uſually received as a fundamental&nbsp;propoſition in mechanics, viz. that what is gained in&nbsp;force by the intervention of a machihe is loft in time,&nbsp;is therefore falſe. There muſt be a particular proportion of the velocities of the impelled and working-points, which will give the greateſt performance when&nbsp;the power and reſiſtance are given ; and there is a certain proportion oſ the power and reſiſtance which will&nbsp;have the ſame effect when thb ſtructure of the machine&nbsp;lias previouſly fixed the velocities of the impelled and&nbsp;working points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This proportion will be found by treating the formula which expreſſes the work as a fluxionaty quantity, and finding its maximum. Thus, when the ratio of the power and reſiſtance is given, and we wiſh to know what muſt be the proportion of the velocities&nbsp;<sub>r</sub>∏ and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n,</span><span class="font1"> that we may conſtruct the machine accordingly, we have only to conſider </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> as the variable quantity in the third formula. This gives us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;√</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This is a fundamental propoſition in the theory of working machines : but the application requires much&nbsp;attention. Some natural powers are not accompanied&nbsp;by any inertia worth minding; in which caſe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> may be&nbsp;omitted. Some works, in like manner, are not accompanied by any inertia ; and this is a very general caſe.&nbsp;In many caſes the work exerts no contrary ſtrain on&nbsp;the machine at reſt, and </span><span class="font2">r </span><span class="font1">is nothing. In moſt inſtances the intenſity of the power varies with the velocity of the impelled point, and is diminiſhed when this&nbsp;increaſes; the reſiſtance or actual preſſure at the working-point frequently increaſes with the velocity of the&nbsp;working-point. All theſe circumſtances muſt be attended to ; but ſtill they only modify the general propoſition. Theſe are matters which do not come within&nbsp;the limits of the preſent article. We only took this&nbsp;opportunity of ſhowing how imperſect is the theory of&nbsp;machines in equilibrio for giving us any knowledge of&nbsp;their performance or juſt principles of their conſtruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One thing, however, muſt be particularly attended to. in this theory. The forces which are applied to the&nbsp;body moveable round an axis are conſidered in the&nbsp;<sub>i</sub> theory as preſſures actually exerted on the impelled&nbsp;points of the body or machine, as when a weight is appended to a lever or wheel and axle, and, by deſeending&nbsp;uniformly, acts with its whole weight In this caſe the&nbsp;■weight multiplied by its diſtance from the axis will al</span><span class="font2">ways expreſs its momentum, and the rotation </span><span class="font1">will </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fa-tens paribus)</span><span class="font1"> be proportional to this product. But in&nbsp;many important caſes our machines are actuated by external impulſions. A body in motion ſtrikes on the&nbsp;impelled point of the machine, and cauſes it to turn&nbsp;round its axis. It is natural for us to conſider the&nbsp;quantity of motion of this impelling body as the meaſure of our moving force. Suppoſing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> to be its quantity of matter, and V its velocity, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">η</span><span class="font2"> V </span><span class="font1">appears a very&nbsp;proper meaſure of its intenſity. And if it be applied&nbsp;at the diſtance CP from the axis of rotation, nV*CP&nbsp;ſhould expreſs its energy, momentum, or power to turn&nbsp;the machine round C ; and we ſhould expreſs the angular velocity by <sup>n</sup>-^-—<sub>j</sub>-. Accordingly, this is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">manner in which calculations are uſually made for the conſtruction and performance of the machine, as may&nbsp;be ſeen in almoſt every treatiſe oſ mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But nothing can be more erroneous, as we ſhall ſhow by a very ſimple inſtance. It ſhould refuît from theſe&nbsp;principles that the angular velocity will be proportional<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>to CP. Let us ſuppoſe our moving power to be </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſtream of water moving at the rate of ten feet per ſecond, and that every ſecond there paſſes ιoo pounds of&nbsp;water. We ſhould then call our moving force ιcoo,&nbsp;It is evident, that iſ we ſuppoſe the arm of the float-board on which it ſtrikes to be infinitely long, the impelled point can never move faſter than ι </span><span class="font2">o </span><span class="font1">ſeet in a ſecond, and this will make the angular velocity infinitely&nbsp;ſmall, inſtead of being the greateſt of all. The rotation will therefore certainly be greater if CP be ſhorter. We need not examine the caſe more minutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We muſt therefore carefully diſtinguiſh between the quantity of motion of the impelling body and its </span><span class="font2">moſ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ving power, as it is modified by its manner of acting, <sub>j&nbsp;</sub>The moving power is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">preſſure actually exerted</span><span class="font1"> on the&nbsp;impelled point of the machine. Now thc univerſal fact of&nbsp;the equality of action and reaction in the colliſion of&nbsp;bodies aſſures us, that their mutual preſſure in their col-liſion is meaſured by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">change</span><span class="font1"> of motion which each&nbsp;ſuſtains: for this change of motion is the only indication and meaſure of the preſſure which we ſuppoſe to&nbsp;be its cauſe. A way therefore of aſcertaining what is&nbsp;the real moving force on a machine actuated by the iιn-pulſion of a moving body, is to diſeover what quantity&nbsp;of motion is loſt by the body or gained by the machine;&nbsp;for theſe are equal. Having diſcovered this, we may&nbsp;proceed according to the propoſitions of rotatory mo,·&nbsp;tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore let AEF (fig. 8.) repreſent a body move-able round an axis paſſing through C, perpendicular to the plane of the figure. Let this body be ſtruck in&nbsp;the point A by a body moving in the direction FA, and.&nbsp;let BAD be a tangent, to the two bodies in the point&nbsp;of colliſion. It is well known that the mutual actions&nbsp;of two folid bodies are always exerted in a direction&nbsp;perpendicular to the touching ſurfaces. Therefore the&nbsp;mutual preſſure oſ the two bodies is in the direction&nbsp;AP perpendicular to AD. Thereſorc let the motion&nbsp;of the impelling body be reſolved into the directions&nbsp;AP and AD. The force AD has<sub>t</sub> no ſhare in the&nbsp;preſſure. Therefore let </span><span class="font2">V </span><span class="font1">be, the velocity of the impelling body eſtimated in the direction AP, and let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">be its quantity of matter. Its quantity of motion </span><span class="font2">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the direction AP will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">η</span><span class="font2"> V.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">Did AP paſs through C, it is evident that the only</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
