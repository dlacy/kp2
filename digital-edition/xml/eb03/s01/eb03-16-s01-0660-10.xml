It has a double intrenchment, with a deep ditch. It is of an orbicular form, and has a very auguſt look, being erected on one of the moſt elegant plans for a fortreſs that can be imagined. In the north-weſt angle ſtood the palace of the biſhop, whoſe fee was removed hither from Wilton and Sherborn; but the biſhop quarrelling with King Stephen, he ſeized the caſtle and put a garriſon into it, which was the principal cauſe of its deſtruction, as the fee was ſoon after removed from hence to Saliſhury in 1219. The area of this ancient city is ſituated on an artificial hill, whoſe walls were three yards thick, the ruins of which in many places in the circumference are ſtill to be ſeen, and the tracks of the ſtreets and cathedral church may be traced out by the different colour of the corn growing whcre once the city ſtood. Here ſynods and parliaments have formerly been held, and hither were the ſtates of the kingdom ſummoned to ſwear fidelity to William the Conqueror. Here alſo was a palace of the Britiſh and Saxon kings, and of the Roman emperors; which was deſerted in the reign of Henry III. for want of water, ſo that one farm-houſe is all that is left of this ancient city; yet it is called the <hi rend="italic">Bo-</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0667.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0661"/>

They got a candle and lantern, and went down a flight of ſteps for more than 30 yards. It was an arched way ſeven feet wide, neatly chiſſeled out of the ſolid rock or chalk. It is probable the crown of the arch gave way from the ſudden thaw, and fell in. There is a great deal of rubbiſh at the entrance. It appears to be between ſix and ſeven feet high, and a circular arch overhead all the way. Theſe particulars I learned from the perfon who himſelf explored it; but was afraid to go farther left it might fall in again and bury him. He thinks it turns a little to the right towards Old Sarum houſe, and continues under the foſſe till it reached the outer verge, The marks of a chiſſel, he ſays, are viable on the fide. There are two large pillars of ſquare-stoneone at the entrance, which appear to have had a door at foot. They are 18 inches by 27, of good free-ſtone, and the maſon-work is extremely neat. The higheſt part of the archway is two feet below the ſurface of the ground</p><p>“It is all now again filled up by order of farmer Whitchurch, who rents the ground of Lord Camelford, and thinks curioſity would bring ſo many people there as to tread down his graſs whenever graſs ſhall be there. I went into it 30 yards, which was as far as I could get for the rubbiſh. I meaſured it with a line, and found it extend full 120 feet inwards from the two pillars ſuppoſed to be the entrance; then onwards it appeared to be filled to the roof with rubbiſh. By meaſuring with the ſame line on the ſurface of the earth, I found it muſt go under the bottom of the outer bank of the outer trench; wſhere I think the opening may be found by digging a very little way. Whether it was a Roman or a Norman work it is difficult to ſay; but it certainly was intended as a private way to go into or cut of the caſtle; and probably a fort or ſtrong caſtle was built over the outer entrance. I looked for inſcriptions or coins, but have not heard of any being found. ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
