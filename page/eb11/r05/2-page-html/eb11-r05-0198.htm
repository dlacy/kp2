Working then in the Lake district, he began to make a special&nbsp;study of rocks and rock-forming minerals, and soon qualified&nbsp;as acting petrographer on the Geological Survey.

<p><span class="font0">RUTUL1, a people of ancient Italy inhabiting Ardea and the district round it on the coast of Latium, at no great distance from Aricia, and just W. of the territory of the Volsci.&nbsp;They are ranked by the form of their name with the Siculi and&nbsp;Appuli (Apuli), probably also with the Itali, whose real Italic&nbsp;name would probably have been Vituli (see Italy). This suggests that they belong to a fairly early stratum of the Indo-European population of Italy. The same is suggested by the&nbsp;tradition adopted or moulded by Virgil, by which the leader&nbsp;of the people of the soil in their resistance to the settlement&nbsp;of Aeneas was the Rutulian prince Turnus, a name which, if any&nbsp;conjecture could be founded on it, might be held to point&nbsp;rather to Etruria than to any pure Italic source; he is represented as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hospes</span><span class="font0"> of the exiled Etruscan king Mezentius, and&nbsp;as taking up arms to defend him against his angry subjects.&nbsp;Pliny (iii. § 6) classes them, with the Siculi, among the primitive&nbsp;tribes that at one time or another inhabited part of Latium, and&nbsp;it is to be observed that they are not included in the thirty&nbsp;Latin communities who once took part in the Latin Festival on&nbsp;the Alban Mount (see further Siculi).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R.

<p><span class="font0">RUVIGNY, HENRI DE MASSUE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marquis de, afterwards Earl of Galway (1648-1720), was born at Paris on the 9th&nbsp;of April 1648, and was the son of the 1st Marquis de Ruvigny,&nbsp;a distinguished French diplomatist, and a relative of Rachel,&nbsp;the wife of Lord William Russell. He saw service under&nbsp;Turenne, who thought very highly of him. Probably on account&nbsp;of his English connexions he was selected in 1678 by Louis&nbsp;XIV. to carry out the secret negotiations for a compact with&nbsp;Charles II., a difficult mission which he executed with great&nbsp;skill. Succeeding his father as “ general of the Huguenots/’&nbsp;he refused Louis’s offer, at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,&nbsp;to retain him in that office, and in 1690, having gone into exile&nbsp;with his fellow Huguenots, he entered the service of William&nbsp;III. of England as a major-general, forfeiting thereby his French&nbsp;estates. In July 1691 he distinguished himself at the battle of&nbsp;Aughrim, and in 1692 he was for a time commander-in-chief in&nbsp;Ireland. In November of that year he was created Viscount&nbsp;Galway and Baron Portarlington, and received a large grant&nbsp;of forfeited estates in Ireland. In 1693 he fought at Neerwinden&nbsp;and was wounded, and in 1694, with the rank of lieutenant-general, he was sent to command a force in English pay which&nbsp;was to assist the duke of Savoy against the French, and at the&nbsp;same time to relieve the distressed Vaudois. But in 1695 the&nbsp;duke changed sides, the Italian peninsula was neutralized, and&nbsp;Galway’s force was withdrawn to the Netherlands. From 1697&nbsp;to 1701, a critical period of Irish history, the Earl of Galway&nbsp;(he was advanced to that rank in 1697) was practically in control&nbsp;of Irish affairs as lord justice of Ireland. After some years&nbsp;spent in retirement, he was appointed in 1704 to command&nbsp;the allied forces in Portugal, a post which he sustained with&nbsp;honour and success until the battle of Almanza in 1707, in&nbsp;which Galway, in spite of care and skill on his own part, was&nbsp;decisively defeated. But he scraped together a fresh army,&nbsp;and, although infirm, was reappointed to his command by the&nbsp;home government. After taking part in one more campaign,&nbsp;and distinguishing himself by his personal bravery in action,&nbsp;he retired from active life. His last service was rendered in&nbsp;1715, when he was sent as one of the lords justices to Ireland&nbsp;during the Jacobite insurrection. As most of his property in&nbsp;Ireland had been restored to its former owners, and all his&nbsp;French estates had long before been forfeited, parliament voted&nbsp;him pensions amounting to £1500 a year. He died unmarried&nbsp;on the 3rd of September 1720. The English peerage died with&nbsp;him, but not the French marquisate.@@</span><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUVO, a town and episcopal see of Apulia, Italy, in the province of Bari, 21m. W. of the city of that name by steam&nbsp;tramway, 853 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 25,245. The&nbsp;cathedral, a basilica with a very lofty nave (so high, indeed,&nbsp;that the gable of the façade is only slightly above the steep&nbsp;sloping roofs of the aisles, and the clerestory is very small),&nbsp;and with two aisles, has three apses, a square campanile and a&nbsp;rich façade with three portals. It belongs probably to the&nbsp;13th century. The interior has a fine triforium; it contains&nbsp;some interesting frescoes of the 15th century, and is unique&nbsp;in Apulia in having a gallery supported by corbels round the&nbsp;nave (see A. Avena, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monumenti dell’ Italia Méridionale,</span><span class="font0"> Rome,&nbsp;1902, 117). S. Giovanni Rotondo is an ancient circular&nbsp;baptistery with two large fonts. In the Palazzo Jatta is a famous&nbsp;and beautiful collection of vases and coins found in the Apulian&nbsp;tombs around the city; part of these, however, are now to be&nbsp;found in the museum at Naples. The Palazzo Spinola has an&nbsp;interesting Renaissance court. Ruvo occupies the site of the&nbsp;ancient Rubi, on the Via Trajana (see Appia, Via). Coins were&nbsp;issued by the city before it became Roman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. As.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUWENZORI, more correctly Runsoro, said to be known also as Kokora, a mountain range in Central Africa, lying just&nbsp;north of the equator, and intersected near its eastern edge by&nbsp;30° E. It has a length of about 65 m., with a maximum breadth&nbsp;of about 30 m., and its highest peaks rise above the limits of&nbsp;perpetual snow. The range as a whole, the major axis of which&nbsp;runs a little east of north, falls steeply on the west to the Central&nbsp;African rift-valley traversed by the Semliki, the western head-stream of the Nile, while on the east the fall is somewhat more&nbsp;gradual towards the highlands of western Uganda. The upper&nbsp;parts are separated by fairly low passes into six groups of snowy&nbsp;summits, lying a little to the west of the central line, rising in&nbsp;each case more than 15,000 ft. above the sea and reaching, in&nbsp;the culminating point of the western group (Mount Stanley),&nbsp;about 16,800 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The origin of the range seems connected with that of the rift-valley on the west, both being due to vertical displacements&nbsp;of the earth’s crust. Ruwenzori has been formed by an upheaval </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font0"> of a portion of the archaean floor of the continent, bounded east and west by lines of fracture, but resulting&nbsp;in a general dip from west to east. A further upheaval seems&nbsp;to have produced an ellipsoidal anticline, causing the strata&nbsp;to dip outwards at a generally high angle. Traces of volcanic&nbsp;action are almost non-existent. Composed in its outer parts&nbsp;of gneisses and mica-schists offering no great resistance to&nbsp;denudation, in its centre the range consists of much more&nbsp;refractory rocks (amphibolites, diorites, diabases, &amp;c.), to which&nbsp;fact, coupled with the existence of vertical fractures, the persistence and separation of the higher summits is probably due.&nbsp;The snow-clad area does not now extend more than ten miles&nbsp;in any direction, though there is abundant evidence that the&nbsp;glaciers were formerly far more extensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The upper region is almost entirely enveloped by day in thick cloud, which ^descends on the east to about 9000 ft.,&nbsp;and lower still on the west. It sometimes lifts towards evening,&nbsp;giving a sight of the snowy peaks, but by 9 a.m. these have</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The later Viscounts Galway are descended from John Monckton (1695-1751), who was created viscount in 1727. His first wife’s&nbsp;mother, wife of the 2nd duke of Rutland, was a daughter of Lady&nbsp;William Russell, and thus a connexion of the Ruvignys.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
