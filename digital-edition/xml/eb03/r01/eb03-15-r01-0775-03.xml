(Dr John), an Engliſh phyſician of great eminence in his time, born at wakefield in Yorkſhire in 1650. He was educated at oxford, and enrolled himſelf upon the phyfical line; but it was re-markable that he recommended himſelf more by his ready wit and vivacity, than by any extraordinary ac-qniſitions in learning. He began to practiſe at oxford in 1675; but never paid any regard to eſtabliſhed rules, which he cenfured whenever he thought fit, with great freedom and acrimony ; and as this drew all the old , <hi rend="sub">w</hi> practitioners upon him, he lived in a continual ſtate of hoſtility with them. Nevertheleſs, his reputation in-creaſed with his experience; ſo that, before he had been two years in buſinefs, his practice was very extenſive among perfons of high rank. In 1684 he removed to London, and fettled in Bow-ſtreet, Covent Garden, where in leſs than a year he got into prime buſineſs. — In 1687 the princeſs Anne of Denmark made him her phyſician : yet when her huſhand and ſhe joined the prince of orange, Radcliffe, either not chooſing to declare himſelf, or unwilling to favour the meafures then in agitation, excufed himſelf from attending them, on the plea of the multitude of his patients. Nevertheleſs, he was often ſent for to King william and other great perfonages, though he did not incline to be a courtier. He incurred ſome cenſure for his treatment of Q^Mary, who died of the finall-pox ; and ſoon aſter loſt his place about the princeſs Anne, by his attachment to his bottle. He alſo totally loſt the favour of K. william by his un-courtly freedom ; for, in 1699, when the king ſhowed</p><p>him his ſwollen ankles, while the reſt of his body was emaciated, and aſked him what he thought of them ? " why truly I would not have your majeſty’s two legs for your three kingdoms,” replied Radcliffe. He continued increafing in buſineſs and inſolence as long as he lived, continually at war with his brethren the phyſi-cians ; who conſidered him in no other light than that of an act ive ingenious empiric, whom conſtant practice had at ∖ ngth brought to ſome degree of ſkill in his profeffi <hi rend="sup">c</hi> ⅛. He died in 1714; and if he never attempt-• td to wrſte any thing himſelf, has perpetuated hie me-mory by founding a fine libraryat Oxford, to preſerve the writings of other men.</p>
