<p><span class="font1">winning his beloved, or of escaping threatened punishment, is often made to turn on his power of answering riddles. It&nbsp;follows from the artless and primitive character of the riddle&nbsp;that regular popular riddles </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Devinettes}</span><span class="font1"> are widely distributed,&nbsp;like popular tales, popular songs and popular customs. The&nbsp;Woloffs ask, “ What flies for ever and rests never ? ” Answer,&nbsp;The wind. The Basutos put this riddle, “ What is wingless&nbsp;and legless, yet flies fast and cannot be imprisoned? ” Answer,&nbsp;The voice. The German riddle runs, “What can go in face&nbsp;of the sun yet leave no shadow ? ” Answer, The wind. In&nbsp;riddles may perhaps be noticed the animistic or personalizing&nbsp;tendency of early human thought, just beginning to be conscious&nbsp;of itself. The person who asked these riddles had the old&nbsp;sense of wind, for example, as a person, yet probably, unlike&nbsp;the bushmen, he would never expect to see the personal wind.&nbsp;He knew the distinction between the personal and impersonal&nbsp;well enough to be sure that his enigma would present some&nbsp;difficulty. The riddle, to be brief, is an interrogatory form of&nbsp;the fable, and like the fable originates among rude people, and&nbsp;is perpetuated in the folklore of peasantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Probably the best book on the riddle (a subject less frequently studied than the märchen or the myth) is Eugene Rolland,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Devinettes ou énigmes populaires,</span><span class="font1"> with a preface by M. Gaston&nbsp;Paris. The power of answering riddles among the people&nbsp;who invented the legend of Solomon and the queen of Sheba&nbsp;seems to have been regarded as a proof of great sagacity. The&nbsp;riddle proper is all but extinct outside folklore and savage life,&nbsp;and has been replaced by the conundrum, which is a pun in&nbsp;the interrogative form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Old English Riddles.</span><span class="font1">—A number of interesting poetical riddles in old English are contained in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exeter Book,</span><span class="font1"> written about a.d.&nbsp;iooo. According to the numbering in the only complete edition&nbsp;(in Grein-Wulker, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothek der Angelsachsiscnes Poesie,</span><span class="font1"> vol. iii.&nbsp;pp. 184-238), there would appear to be 95 of them; but No. 1&nbsp;is the monodramatic lyric </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wulf and Eadwacer,</span><span class="font1"> which was included&nbsp;among the riddles by a mistake of the first editor of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exeter Book,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">B. Thorpe; No. 90 is not in Old English, but in Latin; and several&nbsp;others are mere unintelligible fragments. There remain about 85&nbsp;that have been preserved either entire or with sufficient approach&nbsp;to completeness for their general drift to be perceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The riddles Nos. 2-60 occupy 15 folios in the middle of the MS.; Nos. 62-95 occupy the last 7 folios, and No. 61 and a mutilated and&nbsp;divergent copy of No. 31 are placed by themselves among poems&nbsp;of a different kind. Attempts have been made to show that the&nbsp;two main groups are distinguished from each other by special&nbsp;characteristics that may indicate difference of authorship or date;&nbsp;but there seems to be no good reason for attaching any significance&nbsp;to the arrangement of the MS. Some of the riddles almost certainly&nbsp;were written in Northumbria in the early part of the 8th century;&nbsp;a copy of one of them (No. 36), in Anglian dialect, has been preserved&nbsp;in a MS. at Leiden. Whether all the riddles are the work of one&nbsp;author, or whether they belong to different periods and districts,&nbsp;remains at present uncertain. For the reasons stated in the article&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cynewulf</span><span class="font1"> the attribution of the whole collection to that poet,&nbsp;once almost universally accepted, is now no longer tenable; and&nbsp;there is no overwhelming probability that he is the author of any&nbsp;portion of it.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The investigations of F. Dietrich and A. Ebert have established the fact that a few of the riddles are imitated from the Latin enigmas&nbsp;of Symphosius and Aldhelm. No. 36 is a translation of Aldhelm's&nbsp;riddle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Lorica,</span><span class="font1"> and No. 41 is founded on the same writer’s riddle&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Creatura.</span><span class="font1"> The dependence of the Old English riddles on Latin&nbsp;originals has, however, been greatly exaggerated, especially by A.&nbsp;Prehn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Komposition und Quellen der Rätsel des Exeterbuches,</span><span class="font1"> 1883),&nbsp;who goes so far as to maintain that every one of them contains&nbsp;reminiscences of one or more of the compositions of Symphosius,&nbsp;Aldhelm, Tatwine and Eusebius. The correspondences alleged are&nbsp;in most cases slight, if not purely fanciful, and it is even doubtful&nbsp;whether the two writers last named were known at all to the authors&nbsp;of the vernacular riddles. All the Englishmen who wrote. riddles&nbsp;in the 8th and following centuries, whether they wrote in their&nbsp;native tongue or in Latin, may be said to belong to one school,&nbsp;and their work has many features in common. But except in a few&nbsp;instances the riddles written in Old English are probably not less&nbsp;but more original than those written in Latin. In poetical merit&nbsp;they are generally superior. A good notion of their character and&nbsp;style may be gained from Mr Stopford Brooke’s spirited (though&nbsp;not minutely accurate) translations of many of them in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of Early English Literature,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i. (1892). Mr Brooke’s interpretation of No. U (the Barnacle Goose) is original, and no doubt correct;&nbsp;in some other instances the solutions he has adopted are somewhat&nbsp;more questionable than they would appear to be from his translations.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> For the linguistic arguments against Cynewulf’s authorship of the Riddles see especially A. Madert, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Sprache der altenglischen&nbsp;Rätsel des Exeterbuches und die Cynewulffrage</span><span class="font1"> (1900).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Unlike the Latin riddles of Aldhelm, the riddles of the Exeter Book are unaccompanied with solutions. In some of them, however,&nbsp;the answer is indicated by an anagram, usually expressed in runic&nbsp;characters. Thus No. 24 begins with the words “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Agof</span><span class="font1"> is </span><span class="font0">my&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">name reversed,” where the West Saxon scribe, in accordance with&nbsp;the phonetic laws of his own dialect, has substituted F for the&nbsp;final B of his Anglian original; the word is an anagram of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boga,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ bow.” In No. 25 the mimic skill of the magpie is described, and at the conclusion the name of the bird </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Qiigora)</span><span class="font1"> is indicated by the&nbsp;six letters G, A, R, O, H, 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The solution of nearly all the riddles was attempted by F. Dietrich, in the nth and i2tn volumes of Haupt’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthurn.</span><span class="font1"> In many cases Dietrich was certainly right, but in&nbsp;many others his conjectures are strangely perverse, owing to misleading comparisons with supposed Latin originals. Subsequent&nbsp;scholars. have been much more successful in refuting Dietrich’s&nbsp;explanations than in replacing them by others more satisfactory.&nbsp;The most copious contributor of new interpretations has been Prof.&nbsp;M. Trautmann, in several articles in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anglia,</span><span class="font1"> and also in Bonner,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beiträge zur Anglistik,</span><span class="font1"> No. 19 (1905); but very few of his interpretations can be considered even plausible, and he sometimes rejects the solutions of his predecessors when they are probably right.&nbsp;One riddle (No. 51, Fire) was independently solved by Prof. Traut-mann and G. Herzfeld </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Die Rätsel des Exeterbuches und ihr Verfasser,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1890). The articles on the subject by F. Tupper, Jr., in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modern&nbsp;Philology,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii. (1903), and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Language Notes</span><span class="font1"> for 1903 and&nbsp;1906, are extremely valuable, though the author’s original explanations do not appear convincing. After all that has been done,&nbsp;the meaning of a considerable number of the riddles is still uncertain. In some instances this may be due to the corrupt state of&nbsp;the text; in others the terms in which the object is described are&nbsp;so vague that several solutions are equally plausible.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RIDGE, WILLIAM PETT (1864- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), </span><span class="font1">English author, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">born at Chartham, near Canterbury, and was educated at Marden, Kent, and at the Birkbeck Institute, London. He was for some&nbsp;time a clerk in the Railway Clearing House, and began about&nbsp;1891 to write humorous sketches for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St JamePs Gazette&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and other papers. He secured his first striking success, in&nbsp;volume form, with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mord Em’ly {189$),</span><span class="font1"> an excellent example&nbsp;of his ability to draw humorous portraits of lower class life.&nbsp;His later books include </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Son of the State</span><span class="font1"> (1899), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Breaker of&nbsp;Laws</span><span class="font1"> (1900), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lost Property</span><span class="font1"> (1902), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erb</span><span class="font1"> (1903), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mrs Caleras&nbsp;Business</span><span class="font1"> (1905), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wickhamses</span><span class="font1"> (1906), &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIDGE (a word common to many Teutonic languages, meaning “ back,” whether of a man or an animal, cf. German&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rücke),</span><span class="font1"> the word applied to many objects resembling the&nbsp;projecting line of an animal's back, such as the strip of soil&nbsp;thrown up by a plough between furrows, the elevations or&nbsp;protuberances on bones which serve for the attachment of&nbsp;muscles or ligaments, &amp;c. In architecture the ridge (Fr.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">faite, crête,</span><span class="font1"> Gr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">First;</span><span class="font1"> ItaL </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asinello)</span><span class="font1"> is the highest portion&nbsp;of a roof, which is covered with lead, slate, or tiles, and sometimes decorated with a cresting in terra-cotta or metal-work.&nbsp;The term is also applied to the meeting of the common rafters&nbsp;on each side of a roof, which are sometimes butted against an&nbsp;upright board known as the ridge-piece. For the ridge-rib&nbsp;see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rib.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIDING, the art or practice of locomotion on the back of an animal or in a vehicle (the verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to ride</span><span class="font1"> originally meant&nbsp;“ to travel,” or “go,” as the derived noun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">road</span><span class="font1"> means “ a way”).&nbsp;Where no vehicle is specified </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{e.g.</span><span class="font1"> “ riding a bicycle ”), the&nbsp;word is associated with horseback riding, for exercise or pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The origin of the use of the horse as a means of transport goes back to prehistoric times. The fable of the centaurs, if '&nbsp;the derivation from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kevrecv,</span><span class="font1"> to goad, raὒpos, bull, be accepted&nbsp;(but see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Centaur),</span><span class="font1"> would indicate the early existence of pastoral&nbsp;peoples living on horseback, like the modern cowboys (cp.</span></p>
