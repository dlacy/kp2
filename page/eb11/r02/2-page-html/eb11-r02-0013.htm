<p><span class="font2">of this time they should become his property. This bargain, which included other matters such as steamers, docks and&nbsp;telegraphs, was extraordinarily favourable to Rcid, who, by&nbsp;further enormous grants of land, became one of the Iargest&nbsp;landed proprietors in the world; public opinion was aroused&nbsp;against it, and at first the governor, Sir Herbert Murray, refused&nbsp;to ratify it. After the premier, Sir James Winter, had been&nbsp;replaced by Mr (afterwards Sir) Robert Bond, the terms of&nbsp;the contract were revised, being made more favourable to&nbsp;Newfoundland, and Reid’s interests were transferred to a&nbsp;company, the Reid Newfoundland Company, of which he was&nbsp;the first president (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Newfoundland, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roads and Railways).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Reid was knighted in 1907, and he died on the 3rd of June 1908.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REID, THOMAS (1710-1796), Scottish philosopher, was born at Strachan in Kincardineshire, on the 26th of April 1710.&nbsp;His father was minister of the place for fifty years, and traced&nbsp;his descent from a long line of Presbyterian ministers on Deeside. His mother belonged to the brilliant Gregory family&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> which, in the 18th century, gave so many representatives&nbsp;to literature and science in Scotland. Rcid graduated at Aberdeen in 1726, and remained there as librarian to the university&nbsp;for ten years, a period which he devoted largely to mathematical&nbsp;reading. In 1737 he was presented to the living of Newmachar&nbsp;near Aberdeen. The parishioners, violently excited at the&nbsp;time about the law of patronage, received him with open&nbsp;hostility; and tradition asserts that his uncle defended him&nbsp;on the pulpit stair with a drawn sword. Though not distinguished as a preacher, he was successful in winning -the&nbsp;affections of his people. The publication of Hume’s treatise&nbsp;turned his attention to philosophy, and in particular to the&nbsp;theory of external perception. His first publication, however,&nbsp;dealt with a question of philosophical method suggested by&nbsp;the reading of Hutcheson. The “ Essay on Quantity, occasioned by reading a Treatise in which Simple and Compound&nbsp;Ratios are applied to Virtue and Merit,” denies the possibility&nbsp;of a mathematical treatment of moral subjects. The essay&nbsp;appeared in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font2"> of the Royal Society (1748).&nbsp;In 1740 Reid married a cousin, the daughter of a London&nbsp;physician. In 1752 the professors of King’s College, Aberdeen,&nbsp;elected him to the chair of philosophy, which he held for twelve&nbsp;years. The foundation of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society&nbsp;(the “ Wise Club ”), which numbered among its members&nbsp;Campbell, Beattie, Gerard and Dr John Gregory, was mainIy&nbsp;owing to the exertions of Reid, who was secretary for the first&nbsp;year (1758). Many of the subjects of discussion were drawn&nbsp;from Hume’s speculations; and during the last years of his&nbsp;stay in Aberdeen Reid propounded his new point of view&nbsp;in several papers read before the society. The results of these&nbsp;papers were embodied in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry into the Human Mind on&nbsp;the Principles of Common Sense</span><span class="font2"> (1764). The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry</span><span class="font2"> does not&nbsp;go beyond an analysis of sense perception, and is therefore more&nbsp;limited in scope than the later </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essays;</span><span class="font2"> but if the latter are more&nbsp;mature, there is more freshness about the earlier work. In&nbsp;this year, Reid succeeded Adam Smith as professor of moral&nbsp;philosophy in the university of Glasgow. After seventeen&nbsp;years of active teaching, he retired in order to compIete his&nbsp;philosophical system. As a lecturer, he was inferior in charm&nbsp;and eloquence to Brown and Stewart; the latter says that&nbsp;“ silent and respectful attention ” was accorded to the “ simplicity and perspicuity of his style ” and “ the gravity and&nbsp;authority of his character.” His philosophical influence was&nbsp;exerted largely through the writings of Dugald Stewart and&nbsp;Sir William Hamilton. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essays on the Intellectual Powers&nbsp;of Man</span><span class="font2"> appeared in 1785, and their ethical complement, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind,</span><span class="font2"> in 1788. These,&nbsp;with an account of Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Logic</span><span class="font2"> appended to Lord Karnes’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sketches of the History of Man</span><span class="font2"> (1774), conclude the list of works&nbsp;published in Reid’s lifetime. Hamilton’s edition of Reid aIso&nbsp;contains an account of the university of Glasgow and a selection&nbsp;of Reid’s letters, chiefly addressed to his Aberdeen friends the&nbsp;Skenes, to Lord Karnes, and to Dr James Gregory. With the&nbsp;two last named he discussed the materialism of Priestley and&nbsp;the theory of necessitarianism. He reverted in his old agc&nbsp;to the mathematical pursuits of his earlier years, and his ardour&nbsp;for knowledge of every kind remained fresh to the last. Hc&nbsp;died of paralysis on the 7th of October 1796, his wife and all&nbsp;his children save one having predeceased him. His portrait&nbsp;by Raeburn is the property of Glasgow University, and in&nbsp;the National Portrait Gallcry, Edinburgh, there is a good&nbsp;medallion by Tassie, taken in his eighty-first year. His character was marked by independence, economy and generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The key to Reid’s philosophy is to be found in his revulsion from the sceptical conclusions of Hume. In several passages of his&nbsp;writings he expressly dates his philosophical awakening from the&nbsp;appearance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise of Human Nature.</span><span class="font1"> In the dedication&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry</span><span class="font1">, he says: <sup>u</sup>Thc ingenious author of that treatise&nbsp;upon the principles of Locke—who was no sceptic—hath built a&nbsp;system of scepticism which leaves no ground to believe any one&nbsp;thing rather than its contrary. His reasoning appeared to me to&nbsp;be just; there was, therefore, a necessity to call in question the&nbsp;principles upon which it was founded, or to admit the conclusion.”&nbsp;Reid thus takes Hume’s scepticism as, on its own showing, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reductio&nbsp;ad impossibile</span><span class="font1"> (see Hume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad fin.)</span><span class="font1"> of accepted philosophical&nbsp;principles, and refuses, accordingly, to separate Humc from his&nbsp;intellectual progenitors. From its origin in Descartes and onwards&nbsp;through Locke and Berkeley, modern philosophy carried with it,&nbsp;Reid contends, the germ of scepticism. Embracing the whole&nbsp;philosophic movement under the name of “ the Cartesian system,”&nbsp;Reid detects its fundamental error in the unproved assumption&nbsp;shared by these thinkers “ that all the objects of ray knowledge&nbsp;are ideas in my own mind.” This doctrine or hypothesis he usually&nbsp;speaks of as “the ideal system ” or “ the theory of ideas”;and to&nbsp;it he opposes his own analysis of the act of perception. In view&nbsp;of the results of this analysis, Reid’s theory (ana the theory of&nbsp;Scottish philosophy generally) has been dubbed natural realism or&nbsp;natural dualism, m contrast to theories like, subjective idealism&nbsp;and materialism or to the cosmothctic idealism or hypothetical&nbsp;dualism of the majority of philosophers. But this unduly narrows&nbsp;the. scope of Scottish philosophy, which does not exhaust itself,&nbsp;as is sometimes supposed, in uncritically reasserting the independent&nbsp;existence of matter and its immediate presence to mind. The&nbsp;real significance of Reid's doctrine lies in its attack upon Hume’s&nbsp;fundamental principles, (1) that all our perceptions are distinct&nbsp;existences, and (2) that the mind never perceives any real connexion&nbsp;among distinct existences (cf. Appendix to the third volume of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise,</span><span class="font1"> 1740). It is here that the danger of “ the ideal system ”&nbsp;really.lies—in its reduction of reality to &quot;particular perceptions,”&nbsp;essentially unconnected with each other. This theory admitted,&nbsp;nothing is left for philosophy save to explain the illusion of necessary&nbsp;connexion. Reid, however, attacks the fundamental assumption.&nbsp;In logical language, he denies the actuality of the.abstract particular.&nbsp;The unit of knowledge is not an isolated impression but a judgment;&nbsp;and in such a judgment.is contained, even initially, the reference&nbsp;both to a permanent subject and to a permanent world of thought,&nbsp;and, implied in these, such judgments, for example, as those of&nbsp;existence, substance, cause and effect. Such principles are not&nbsp;derived from sensation, but are “ suggested ’ on occasion of&nbsp;sensation, in such a way as to constitute the necessary conditions&nbsp;of our having perceptive experience at all. Thus we do not start&nbsp;with “ideas, and afterwards refer them to objects; we are never&nbsp;restricted to our own minds, but are from the first immediately&nbsp;related to a permanent world. Reid has a variety of names for the&nbsp;principles which, by their presence, lift us out of subjectivity into&nbsp;perception. He calls them “ natural judgments,” “ natural suggestions,” “judgments of nature,”, “judgments immediately&nbsp;inspired by our constitution,” “ principles of our nature,” “ first&nbsp;principles,” “ principles of common sense.” The last&nbsp;designation, which became the current one, was undoubtedly unfortunate, and has conveyed to many a false&nbsp;impression of Scottish philosophy. It has been understood as if&nbsp;Reid had merely appealed from the reasoned conclusions of philosophers to the unreasoned beliefs of common life. But Reid’s&nbsp;actions are better than his words; his real mode of procedure is to&nbsp;redargue Hume’s conclusions by a refutation of the premises inherited by him from his predecessors. For the rest, as regards&nbsp;the question of nomenclature, Reid everywhere unites common&nbsp;sense and reason, making the former “only another name, for&nbsp;one branch or degree of reason.” Reason, as judging of things&nbsp;self-evident, is called common sense to distinguish it from ratiocination or reasoning. And in regard to Reid’s favourite proof of&nbsp;the principles in question by reference to “ the consent of ages and&nbsp;nations, of the learned and unlearned,” it is only fair to observe&nbsp;that this argument assumes a much more scientific form in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays,</span><span class="font1"> where it is almost identified with an appeal to “ the structure&nbsp;and grammar of all languages.” “ The structure of all languages,”&nbsp;he says, “ is grounded upon common sense.” To take but one&nbsp;example, “ the distinction between sensible qualities and the&nbsp;substance to which they belong, and between thought and the&nbsp;mind that thinks, is not the invention of philosophers; it is found</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
