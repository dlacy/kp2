For a short time in 1885-86 he sat in the Chamber of Deputies, but found a great opportunity next year for his talent for inflaming public opinion in the Boulangist agitation. He was condemned to detention in a fortress in August 1889 at the same time as General Boulanger, whom he had followed into exile. He continued his polemic from London, and after the suicide of General Boulanger he attacked M. Constans, minister of the interior in the Freycinet cabinet, with the utmost violence, in a series of articles which led to an interpellation in the chamber in circumstances of wild excitement and disorder. The Panama scandals furnished him with another occasion, and he created something of a sensation by a statement in the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>  that he had met M. Clemenceau at the table of the financier Cornélius Herz. In 1895 he returned to Paris, two years before the Dreyfus affair supplied him with another <hi rend="italic">point d’appud.</hi>  He became a leader of the anti-Dreyfusards, and had a principal share in the organization of the press campaign.

' Resident pop. (1904) 3068, which in July and August is doubled. It is of ancient origin, its position at the point where the route to St Hubert crossed that from Lidge to Bouillon having made it at all times a place of some importance. The ruins of the old castle, which gave the place its name and a title to a long line of counts who had the right of coining their own money, still exist. This castle underwent many sieges and suffered much in the earlier wars, especially at the hands of Marshal de Chatillon<hi rend="sup">1</hi> in 1636. Rochefort is noted for its healthiness, and is a favourite place of residence. It also attracts every summer a large number of visitors and tourists, who visit it on account of the remarkable grottoes in its neighbourhood. One of these is situated in the town itself and is known by its name. This grotto contains six halls or chambers, the largest of which is called the Sabbat, and is remarkable for its great height. But the most famous are the grottoes of Han, situated three miles from Rochefort at Han sur Lesse. Here the river Lesse passes by a subterranean and undiscovered passage under the hill called Boeme or Boine. The endeavour to trace the course of the river led to the discovery of the grottoes, which consist of fifteen separate halls, connected by passages more or less short and emerging on the river in a dark and extensive cavern forming<hi rend="bold">a </hi>sort of side creek or bay. Except in flood-time, when the exit has to be used, the entrance is near the-point where the river disappears at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux, and the exit is made by boat from the cavern last described, which leads out to the open river. A beautiful effect is afforded by the passage from the complete darkness of this cavern into the light. The finest stalactites are in the three halls called the Mystérieuses, the Vigneron and the Draperies. · In the last-named is “ the tomb,” which looks as if chiselled out of white marble. The central hall—called the Salle d’Armes—is immense, and one of the river channels flows through it. Electric light has been introduced. Near Rochefort are the famous red marble quarries of St Remy, and the old Cistcrcian abbey of that name is now a Trappist seminary.</p><p>ROCHEFORT, a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Charente-Inférieure, 20 m. S.S.E. of La Rochelle on the State railway from Nantes to Bordeaux. Pop. (1906) town, 31,433; commune, 36,694. It is situated on the right bank of the Charente, 9 m. from the Atlantic, and is built partly on the side of a rocky hill and partly on an old marshland. The town is laid out with great regularity, the streets being wide and straight and centring round the Place Colbert, in the middle of which is a monumental fountain of the 18th century. The public institutions of Rochefort comprise the sub-prefecture, tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce, a lycée for boys, a college for girls and schools of drawing and architecture. The fortifications are slight. Below Rochefort the Charente is crossed by a <hi rend="italic">pont transbordeur,</hi>  the carrier of which is suspended at a height which admits of the tallest ships passing underneath at any time. There are both a naval and a commercial harbour. The former has the advantage of deep anchorage well protected by batteries at the mouth of the river, and the roadstead is perfectly safe. The windings of the channel, however, between Rochefort and the sea, and the bar at the entrance render navigation dangerous. Rochefort is capital of the fourth maritime arrondissement, which stretches from the bay of Bourgneuf to the coast of Spain. The naval harbour and arsenal, separated from the town by a line of fortifications with three gates, contain large covered building yards, repairing docks and extensive timber basins on both banks of the river. The arsenal has also a ropewalk dating from 1668, a school of navigation and pilotage, the offices of the maritime prefecture, the navy commissariat, a park of · artillery and various boards of direction connected with the navy. Other government establishments at Rochefort are barracks for infantry, artillery and marines, and the naval hospital and school of medicine. In the grounds of this last institution is an artesian well, sunk in 1862-1866 to a depth of 2800 ft., and yielding water with a temperature of 100° F. The commercial harbour, higher up the river than the naval harbour, has two small basins, a third basin with an area of 15 acres and a depth at neap-tide of 25 ft., at spring-tide <hi rend="bold">of </hi>29I ft., and a dry dock no yds. long. Besidesshipbuilding, which forms the staple industry, flour- and saw-milling, sailcloth, &amp;c., are among the local manufactures. At the ports of Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente (4 m. higher up) there entered, in 1905, 265 vessels (166 British), with a tonnage of 192,537·</p><p>The lordship of Rochefort, held by powerful nobles as early as the nth century, was united to the French Crown by Philip the Fair early in the 14th century; but it was alternately seized in the course of the Hundred Years’ War by the EngUsh and the French, and in the Wars of Religion by the Catholics and Protestants. Colbert having in 1665 chosen Rochefort as the seat of a repairing port between Brest and the Gironde, the town rapidly increased in importance; by 1674 it had 20,000 inhabitants; and when the Dutch admiral Cornelius Tromp appeared at the mouth of the river with seventy-two vessels for the purpose of destroying the new arsenal, he found the approaches so well defended that he gave up his enterprise. It was at Rochefort that the naval school, afterwards transferred to Brest, was originally founded. The town continued to flourish in the later part of the 17th century. In 1690 and in 1703 the English made unsuccessful attempts to destroy it. Its fleet, under the command of Admiral la Gallissonnière, a native of the place, defeated Admiral Byng in 1755 and did good service in the wars of the repubUc. But the destruction of the French fleet by the English in 1809 in the roadstead of île d’Aix, the preference accorded to the harlïours of Brest and Toulon and the unhealthiness of its climate seriously interfered with the prosperity of the place. The convict establishment, founded at Rochcfort in 1777, was suppressed in 1852.</p><p><hi rend="bold">ROCHESTER, JOHN WILMOT, 2ND </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Earl</hi>  or (1647-1680), English poet and wit, was the son of HenryWilmot, ist earl. The family was descended from Edtvard Wilmot of Witney, Oxfordshire, whose son Charles <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi>  1570-c. 1644), having served tvith distinction in Ireland during the rebellion at the beginning of the 17th century, was president of Connaught from 1616 until his death.
