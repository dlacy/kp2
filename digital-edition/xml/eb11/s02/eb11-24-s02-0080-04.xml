The shrine of Sidi Abd Allah Hasün in Salli is so sacred as to close the street in which it stands to any but Moslems. Outside the town walls there is no security for life or property. A bar at the mouth of the river excludes vessels of more than two hundred tons; steamers lie outside, communicating with the port by lighters of native build manned by descendants of the pirates known as “ Salli Rovers.” (See Barbary Pirates.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
