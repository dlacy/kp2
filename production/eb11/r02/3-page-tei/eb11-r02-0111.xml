This is of very complicated shape. Its outer margins form most of the tympanic frame; the posterior margins being curved backwards leave a wide notch behind in the Cryptodira and in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi>  but in the Pleurodira this part of the quadrate is transformed into a trumpet, the rim of which, forming a complete ring, carries thc tympanic membrane. The tympanic cavity thus formed often leads into a deep recess which extends into the hollowed-out squamosal <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi>  in <hi rend="italic">Testudo)</hi>  towards the opisthotic and bears some resemblance to the intricate tympanic recesses which pervade that region of the crocodile’s skull. With its upper anterior and</p><lb/><p>inner portion the quadrate joins the large proötic bone which is usually completely fused with the rest of the opisthotic, but in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi>  it remains separate, and in this turtle the sutures between the otic bones and the Supraoccipital also persist. In front of the prootics the bony lateral walls of the brain-case end in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi>  but· in most of the other Chelonians bony alisphenoids are represented by a pair of epipterygoids which rest upon short upward processes of the pterygoids and are joined by much longer, rather thin, but broad descending lamellae from</p><lb/><p>the parietals. They represent of course the columcllae cranii or Pterygoidal columcllae; if they are of alisphenoidal origin thc term epipterygoids is a misnomer; the same applies to these structures in other reptiles. Through the space enclosed by thc pterygoid, basioccipital, opisthotic and quadrate, enters thc cranial carotid artery, sometimes piercing thc posterior rim of the pterygoid; then thc canal runs along thc dorsal side of this bone and opens near thc cranial columella. Thc arcades over thc temporal region arc most variable. Potentially Chelonians possess all the three arcades of the crocodiles, but it so happens that never more than one fenestra is present. The false roof over thc temporal region is most complete in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi>  and in thc <hi rend="italic">Chelonidae.</hi>  Excepting <hi rend="italic">Sphargis the</hi>  Supraoccipital extends far beyond thc back of the cranium in shape of a long unpaired crest, which never diverges, or sends out lateral processes, but it is joined, and partly overlaid for a great part of its length, by the parietals in <hi rend="italic">Chelonidae </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Sphargis.</hi>  In these genera the much-enlarged parietal, the equally large postfrontal, with the squamosal behind, the jugal below, and a large quadrato-jugal, form one continuous bony roof over the whole temporal fossa, which is widely open behind, the space being bordered by Supraoccipital, opisthotic, squamosal and parietal. All other Chclonians show a great reduction of this roof. Thc parietal does not send out dorsolateral expansions; and the postfrontal likewise forms no expansions. It joins the rather short malar, forming the posteriororbital bridge, which posteriorly is connected by the quadrato-jugal with the upper portion of the quadrate and with thc squamosal. The latter rests upon the quadrate and is in no connexion with the parietal.</p><p>Consequently the whole temporal fossa is quite open. The horizontal bridge or arcade is to a certain extent homologous with the infra-temporal arcade. All the bones which border the temporal fossa vary much in extent. The greatest reduction has taken place in <hi rend="italic">Cistudo</hi>  and in <hi rend="italic">Geoemyda<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  the latter an Indian genus of Testudinidae, in which the quadrato-jugal is lost, leaving a wide gap in the horizontal arcade.—The Chelonians form an instructive parallel to mammalian conditions by the broad contact of the squamosal with the malar, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  in <hi rend="italic">Chelone,</hi>  whilst the quad</p><lb/><p>rato-jugal, having in all Chelonians lost its original ventral connexion with the jugal, may actually get lost as in all thc</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
