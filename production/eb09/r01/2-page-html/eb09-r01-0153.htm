<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Greek manuscripts. He returned from Italy in 1471 and settled at Nuremberg, at that time one of the chief centres&nbsp;of German industry and literary life. Here he became&nbsp;associated with Bernhard Walther (1430-1504), a wealthy&nbsp;patrician and an enthusiastic astronomer. An observatory&nbsp;was erected, and the finest instruments the skilful artisans&nbsp;of Nuremberg could make were regularly used by the two&nbsp;friends for observing the heavens. Clocks driven by&nbsp;weights were here used for the first time for scientific&nbsp;purposes, the influence of refraction in altering the&nbsp;apparent places of the stars better appreciated, Venus&nbsp;substituted for the moon as a connecting link between&nbsp;observations of the sun and of stars, and other improvements introduced in practical astronomy. Regiomontanus&nbsp;also published a number of calendars and ephemerides,&nbsp;which induced Pope Sixtus IV. to summon him to Rome&nbsp;to assist in reforming the confused calendar. He died&nbsp;very shortly after his arrival in Rome, July G, 1476.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1464 Regiomontanus finished a work on trigonometry, which science had made considerable progress among the Arabians but&nbsp;had to be reinvented in Europe. The work was, however, never&nbsp;printed till 1533 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Da Triangulis libri quinqué),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> probably because&nbsp;the author, after introducing the use of tangents, had wished to&nbsp;re-write his book, but was prevented from doing so by his early&nbsp;death. In his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tabulae Direclionum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Nuremberg, 1475) there is&nbsp;a table of tangents (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tabula fecunda).</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> His instruments and observations at Nuremberg are described in a posthumous work,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Scripta&nbsp;clarissimi mathematic¿ Joh. Regiomontani</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Nuremberg, 1544).&nbsp;The ephemerides and calendars were published partly in German&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Magister Johann von Kunsperk’s teutschcr Keilender),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> partly in&nbsp;Latin (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ephemerides Astronomicae,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Nuremberg, 1473 or 1475, for&nbsp;the years 1475-1506 ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kalendarium Novum,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Nuremberg 1474, reissued many times and translated into German and Italian). The&nbsp;German geographer Martin Behem made these calendars known&nbsp;among the Spanish and Portuguese navigators, and they became&nbsp;of the greatest importance in guiding Columbus, Diaz, Vasco da&nbsp;Gama, and many others over the trackless ocean. The life of&nbsp;Regiomontanus was written by Gassendi (The Hague, 1654);&nbsp;among modern works see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Regiomontanus, ein geistiger Vorläufer&nbsp;des Copernicus,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Zeigler (Dresden, 1874), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Die Vorgeschichte der&nbsp;■Gregorianischen Kalenderreform,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Kaltenbrunner (Vienna, 1876),&nbsp;and Rudolph Wolfs </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Astronomie</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Munich, 1877).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGISTRATION. In all systems of law the registration of certain legal facts has been regarded as necessary, chiefly for the purpose of ensuring publicity and simplifying evidence. Registers, when made in performance of a&nbsp;public duty, are as a general rule admissible in evidence&nbsp;merely on the production from the proper custody of the&nbsp;registers themselves or (in most cases) of examined or certified copies. The extent to which registration is carried&nbsp;varies very much in different countries. For obvious&nbsp;reasons judicial decisions are registered in all countries&nbsp;alike. In other matters no general rule can be laid down,&nbsp;except perhaps that on the whole registration is not as&nbsp;fully enforced in the United Kingdom and the United&nbsp;States as in Continental states. The most important uses&nbsp;of registration occur in the case of judicial proceedings,&nbsp;land, ships, bills of sale, births, marriages, and deaths,&nbsp;companies, friendly and other societies, newspapers, copyrights, patents, designs, trade marks, and professions and&nbsp;occupations. The registration of qualified voters in parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom is treated in&nbsp;a separate section below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judicial Proceedings</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In England registrars are attached to the privy council, the Supreme Court, and the county courts. In the&nbsp;Queen’s Bench Division (except in its bankruptcy jurisdiction) the&nbsp;duty of registrars is performed by the masters. Besides exercising&nbsp;limited judicial authority, registrars are responsible for the drawing&nbsp;־up and recording of various stages of the proceedings from the&nbsp;petition, writ, or plaint to the final decision.@@<sup>1</sup> With them are&nbsp;filed affidavits, depositions, pleadings, &amp;c., when such filing is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">necessary. The difference between filing and registration is that the documents filed are filed without alteration, while only an&nbsp;epitome is usually registered. The Judicature Act, 1873, created&nbsp;district registries in the chief towns, the district registrar having an&nbsp;authority similar to that of a registrar of the Supreme Court. In&nbsp;the Admiralty Division cases of account are usually referred to the&nbsp;registrar and merchants. The registration in the central office of&nbsp;the supreme court of judgments affecting lands, writs of execution,&nbsp;recognizances, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">litespendentes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in England, and the registration&nbsp;in Scotland of abbreviates of adjudications and of inhibitions, are&nbsp;governed by special legislation. All these are among the incumbrances for which search is made on investigating a title. Their&nbsp;satisfaction and discharge is also registered. The Conveyancing&nbsp;Act, 1882, provides for a certificate by the proper officer of the&nbsp;existence or non-existence of entries of judgments, deeds, and other&nbsp;matters or documents made in the central office. The certificate is&nbsp;conclusive in favour of a purchaser. Decisions of criminal courts&nbsp;are said to be recorded, not registered, except in the case of courts&nbsp;of summary jurisdiction, in which, by the Summary Jurisdiction&nbsp;Act, 1879, a register of convictions is kept. Probates of ־wills and&nbsp;letters of administration, which are really judicial decisions, are&nbsp;registered in the principal or district registries of the Probate&nbsp;Division. In Scotland registration'is used for giving a summary&nbsp;remedy on obligations without action by means of the fiction of a&nbsp;judicial decision having been given establishing the obligation.&nbsp;A clause of registration is introduced in deeds importing obligation. The various registers available for this kind, of registraton&nbsp;will be found in Watson, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Law Diet., s.v. “</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Registration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Land.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> —Registration in its relation to land is either of title or of assurances. A register of title bears on the face of it the name and&nbsp;description of a plot of land with more or less particularity, the&nbsp;name of the owner, and the charges and easements to which the land&nbsp;is subject. No one can go behind the entry except in case of fraud.&nbsp;A register of assurances or deeds contains only a copy of documents&nbsp;affecting title, or a memorial qr other epitome of such documents,&nbsp;without any authentication of the title as such. Thus a register&nbsp;of title would show that A was owner subject to a mortgage to B,&nbsp;and the purchaser would purchase such a title. A register of&nbsp;assurances would show in the same circumstances that a conveyance&nbsp;had been made to A, and that subsequently A had mortgaged to B,&nbsp;but the purchaser would have to make sure for himself that A and&nbsp;B had the right to convey and mortgage. It will be obvious that&nbsp;the object of registration of deeds is quite different from that of&nbsp;registration of title. The former aims at facilitating the search&nbsp;for incumbrances, the latter at abolishing search by making it&nbsp;unnecessary. The requisites of a registry of title are thus stated&nbsp;by Sir H. Maine (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Early Law and Custom,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 353):—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The land registries which have the highest commendation from judicial writers are those of certain small Teutonic communities, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> the state of Htsse-Darmstadt and the Swiss canton of Zurich. </span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font1">can here give hut </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">brief description of the mechanism. The land of the community is divided into </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">number of&nbsp;circumscriptions of no great area. For each of these a central office is established,&nbsp;with </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">staff of functionaries who are to some extent experts, and at eacli office </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">register is opened in which separate portions or groups of pages are appropriated&nbsp;to separate masses of land . . . When the register has once been opened, the&nbsp;legal history of every parcel of every area is thenceforward recorded in it, and&nbsp;every transfer or mortgage must be registered in it, under pain of invalidity.&nbsp;Whether a person wishing to sell or mortgage has the right to do so, it is the&nbsp;business of the staff of experts to ascertain. It is absolutely essential to the&nbsp;system that the register should be easily accessible, and the formalities of&nbsp;registration simple and cheap.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It will appear on referring to </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Real Estate </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">that before the Conquest publicity of transfer was secured by a system of record&nbsp;in the sliire-book or church-book. After the Conquest this publicity, continued for a time in the Domesday survey, from various&nbsp;causes gradually gave way to that secrecy of transfer which is now&nbsp;one of the peculiar features of English law. Publicity was to a&nbsp;certain extent secured by the court rolls in the case of copyhold&nbsp;lands, by the local statutes mentioned below, and by the Act&nbsp;enforcing the registration of rent charges and annuities charged on&nbsp;land (18 Viet. c. 15). There was a tendency in the same direction&nbsp;in those statutes which made the enrolment of deeds necessary for&nbsp;their validity. Such are the Statute of Enrolments, 27 Henry VIII.&nbsp;c. 16, the Mortmain Act, 9 Geo. II. c. 36, the Fines and Recoveries&nbsp;Act, 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 74, under which an estate tail may be barred&nbsp;by an enrolled deed, ard Acts affecting Queen Anne’s Bounty, 1&nbsp;Geo. I., st. 2, c. 10, and the Charity Commissioners, 18 &amp; 19 Viet,&nbsp;c. 124. No general registry has as yet been established in England,&nbsp;though many attempts have been made in that direction. The&nbsp;question was debated as far back as the Long Parliament. General&nbsp;Ludlow mentions the characteristic incident “that upon the debate&nbsp;of ‘ registering deeds in each county for want of which, within a&nbsp;certain time fixed after the sale, such sales should be void, and,&nbsp;being so regarded, that lands should not be subject to any incumbrance,’ this word incumbrance was so managed that it took up&nbsp;three months’ time before it could be ascertained by the committee” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, i. 436). In the reign of Charles II. a registry&nbsp;of deeds was established for the Bedford Level by 15 Car. II. c. 17.&nbsp;I n the reign of Anne registries of deeds and wills were established</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> The antiquity of registration of this kind is proved by the age of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Registrum Brevium,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or register of writs, called by Lord Coke “ a&nbsp;most ancient book of the Common Law” (Coke upon Littleton, 159a).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
