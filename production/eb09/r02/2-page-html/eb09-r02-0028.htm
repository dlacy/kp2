<p><span class="font1">They are much specialized in their mode of life and propagation, and ill adapted to accommodate themselves to a change of external conditions. As air-breathing coldblooded animals they are unable to withstand prolonged&nbsp;cold ; they are therefore entirely absent in the arctic and&nbsp;antarctic zones ; and such as escape the effect of the winter&nbsp;months in temperate zones by passing them in a torpid&nbsp;condition in well-sheltered places are not peculiarly&nbsp;organized forms, but offshoots from those inhabiting&nbsp;warmer climes. The tropical and subtropical zones are the&nbsp;real home of the Reptilian type, which there has reached&nbsp;its greatest development as regards size and variety of&nbsp;forms. In the north Chelonians advance only to 50° lat. in&nbsp;the western and to 56° in the eastern hemisphere, Lizards&nbsp;to about 56° in British Columbia, and close to the Arctic&nbsp;Circle in Europe, whilst Snakes disappear some degrees&nbsp;before the Lizards. Also in the south Lizards extend into&nbsp;higher latitudes than Snakes, viz., to the Straits of Magellan, whilst the latter do not seem to have advanced&nbsp;beyond 40° S. lat. and Chelonians only to 36°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We exclude from our account of the distribution of terrestrial Reptiles those few forms which pass almost the&nbsp;whole of their life in the sea, and therefore belong to the&nbsp;marine faunæ, viz., the Marine Turtles and Sea-Snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shores of the continents and islands of the equatorial&nbsp;zone are the home of the Marine Turtles. Endowed with a&nbsp;wonderful power of locomotion, the several species are now distributed over the greater part of this zone, occurring in the Atlantic as&nbsp;well as the Indo-Pacifιc ; and, although some of them are common&nbsp;in certain districts and scarcer or even absent in others, it is probable that in the course of time their distribution will be still&nbsp;more general and uniform, as far as other conditions (such as access&nbsp;to a suitable locality for the successful propagation of their kind)&nbsp;will permit. Frequently Marine Turtles stray far into the&nbsp;temperate zones, and it thus happens that one and the same&nbsp;species G3phargis coriαxeα) has been found on the south coast of&nbsp;England, near Cape Cod in North America, and on the coast of&nbsp;Chili. In short the geographical distribution of these Reptiles is&nbsp;that of pelagic animals generally, although by their mode of propagation they are compelled to sojourn near land during a certain&nbsp;period of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea-Snakes are restricted to, and highly characteristic of,&nbsp;the fauna of the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, and more especially&nbsp;of parts between Arabia and North Australia. They prefer the&nbsp;vicinity of laud, but never leave the water, with, perhaps, the&nbsp;single exception of Platums. Their distribution is not erratic ;&nbsp;only one species, Pelamys bieolor, a Sea-Snake which more than&nbsp;any other is organized for a marine life, has spread far beyond the&nbsp;original home of its kindred, viz., westwards to the coasts of&nbsp;Madagascar and south-eastern Africa, and eastwards to the furthermost limits of the region, viz., to the coasts of central and northern&nbsp;South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All other Reptiles</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> are terrestrial, and, as they are chiefly developed in the tropics, we begin our account&nbsp;with the regions</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> of the equatorial zone. The scope of this&nbsp;article does not allow us to enter into an examination of the&nbsp;subregions which have been proposed by various authors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Three of these genera are peculiar to the region, viz., Manouria,@@<sup>3 </sup>Platysternum, and Emyda. Characteristic is the scanty representation of Testudo. One species which is common in the Indian&nbsp;peninsula (2<sup>,</sup>. stellata} is so similar to an African species as to have&nbsp;been considered identical with it ; the Burmese Tortoise is also&nbsp;closely allied to it, and the two others extend far into western&nbsp;Central Asia. Thus this type is to be considered rather an immigrant from its present headquarters, Africa, than a survivor of the&nbsp;Indian Tertiary fauna, which comprised the most extraordinary&nbsp;forms of Land Tortoises. Wallace’s line marks the eastern boundary of Trionyx ; species of this genus are common in Java and&nbsp;Borneo, and occur likewise in the Philippine Islands, but are not&nbsp;found in Celebes, Amboyna, or any of the other islands east of&nbsp;Wallace’s line.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilidæ</span><span class="font1"> true Crocodiles are represented by four, and Gavials by two species. Alligators are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the region is characterized by numerous highly specialized genera of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Laceritilia,</span><span class="font1"> not one of the families is&nbsp;peculiar to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Agamidæ are exceedingly numerous, and are represented chiefly by arboreal forms ; terrestrial forms, like Aganιa and Urαmastix,&nbsp;inhabit the hot and sandy plains in the north-west, and pass uninterruptedly into the fauna of western Central Asia and Africa.&nbsp;The Geekonidæ, Scincidæ, and Varanûdæ are likewise well represented, but without giving a characteristic feature to the region by&nbsp;special modification of the leading forms. The Laeeriidæ are represented by one characteristic genus, Tachydromus,—Ophiops and&nbsp;Cabrita being more developed beyond the limits assigned to this&nbsp;region. Finally, the Eublepharidæ and Anguidæ, families whose&nbsp;living representatives are probably the scattered remains of once&nbsp;widely and more generally distributed types, have retained respectively two species in western India, and one in Khassia (Khasi&nbsp;Hills), whilst the presence of a single species of Chamæleon in&nbsp;Southern India and Ceylon reminds us again of the relations of&nbsp;this part of the fauna to that of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Indian region excels all the other equatorial regions in the great variety of generic types and number of&nbsp;species of Snakes. The latter amount to no less than four&nbsp;hundred and fifty, which is nearly one-third of the total&nbsp;number of species known. They are referable to about&nbsp;one hundred genera, of which the majority do not range&nbsp;beyond the limits of the region. Of higher groups (termed&nbsp;families for the sake of convenience), the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Xenopeltidæ,&nbsp;Rhinophulæ, Oligodontidæ, Xenodermidæ, and Acrochordidæ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">are peculiar to, and characteristic of, this fauna,—but not&nbsp;more so than a number of genera which will be mentioned&nbsp;presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Typhlopidæ more than twenty species are known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Tortrieidæ, the genus Cylindrophis is spread over several of the subregions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Calamariidæ are represented by a whole string of genera, of which thirteen are peculiar to the region. The most characteristic&nbsp;and geographically most important types are Calamaria, with&nbsp;twenty-four species, spread over the archipelago and the eastern&nbsp;parts of the continent, and Aspidura and Haplocercus, with four&nbsp;species, which are limited to Ceylon and southern India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Species of those generalized forms which are termed CoronelliJæ and Colubridæ are likewise numerous (sixty-six species), and&nbsp;referable to seventeen genera, of which ten are limited to this&nbsp;region. In the north-western and northern parts the genus&nbsp;Zamenis, which is one of the most characteristic types of the warmer&nbsp;parts of the Europo-Asiatic fauna, is represented by six species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Freshwater Snakes are abundant in genera,-species, and individuals. Of Tropidonοtus alone some forty very distinct species have been described, besides three others which are sufficiently differentiated to deserve generic separation. Of the so-called Homalopswlæ&nbsp;all the genera, twelve in number, are peculiar, and the great&nbsp;development of these Snakes is, therefore, one of the most striking&nbsp;features of this region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides two species of Psammophis allied to African forms, a distinct genus Psammodynastes has a wide range over the eastern parts of the continent and the archipelago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tree Snakes are represented by eight genera and twenty-six species, mostly characteristic forms.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Oreοcephalus enters the sea habitually and Cher-sydrus frequently does not entitle these Reptiles to be classed among&nbsp;marine animals ; they pass the greater part of their life on land, and&nbsp;never leave its close vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general boundaries of the zoo-geographical regions&nbsp;we refer to Wallace’s Geographical Distribution of Animals (London,&nbsp;1870, 4to) or to the article Ichthyology (vol. xii. pp. 668 sq.).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its existence in Australia is extremely doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that specimens of Trionyx had been obtained by&nbsp;Ida Pfeiffer in Amboyna rests upon a misunderstanding, like that of&nbsp;the discovery of a Barbel by the same traveller in the same island.&nbsp;Dr Jentink also informs us that none of the Freshwater Turtles in the&nbsp;Leyden Museum came fron' islands east of Java and Borneo.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
