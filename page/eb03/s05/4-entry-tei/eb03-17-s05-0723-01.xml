among ſportſmen, a living fowl put in a place to allure ad bring others where they may be taken. For want of theſe, a bird shot, his entrails taken out, and dried in an oven in his feathers, with a stick thrust through to keep it in a convenient poſture, may ſerve as well as a live one.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stale</hi> is alſo a name for the urine of cattle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Animated</hi> STALK. This remarkable animal was found by Mr Ives at Cuddalore : and he mentions ſeveral kinds of it ; ſome appearing like dry straws tied together, others like graſs ; ſome have bodies much larger than others, with the addition of two ſcaly imperfect wings ; their neck is no bigger than a pin, but twice as long as their bodies ; their heads are like thoſe of an hare and their eyes vertical and very briſk. They live upon flies, and catch theſe infects very dexterouſly with the two fore-feet, which they keep doubled up in three parts cloſe to their head, and dart out very quick on the approach of their prey ; and when they have caught it, they eat it very voraciouſly, holding it in the ſame manner as a ſquirrel does its food. On the outer joints of the fore-feet are ſeveral very sharp hooks for the easier catching and holding of their prey ; while, with the other feet, which are four in number, they take hold of trees or any other thing, the better to ſurpriſe whatever they lie in wait for. They drink like a horſe, putting their mouths into the water. Their excrements, which are very white, are almost as large as the body of the animal, and as the natives ſay, dangerous to the eyes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
