<p><span class="font0">of Letters, in prose. A good edition of his Select Pieces appeared at Paris in 1741, in a small 12mo volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rousseau, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John-James,</span><span class="font0"> one of the most renowned writers of modem times, was born at Geneva on the 28th of June 1712. His father was by profession a clock and watch&nbsp;maker. At his birth, which, he says, was the first of his&nbsp;misfortunes, he endangered the life of his mother ; and he&nbsp;himself was for a long time afterwards in a very weak and&nbsp;languishing state of health. But as his bodily strength increased, his mental powers gradually opened, and afforded&nbsp;the happiest presages of future greatness. His father, a&nbsp;citizen of Geneva, was a well-informed tradesman ; and in&nbsp;the place where he wrought he kept a Plutarch and a Tacitus, authors which of course soon became familiar to his&nbsp;son. A rash juvenile step, however, occasioned his leaving his father’s house. “ Finding himself a fugitive in a&nbsp;strange country, and without money or friends, he changed&nbsp;his religion, in order to procure a subsistence.” Bornex,&nbsp;bishop of Anneci, from whom he sought an asylum, committed the care of his education to Madame de Warrens,&nbsp;a lady, who in 1726 had left part of her wealth, and the&nbsp;Protestant religion, in order to throw herself into the bosom&nbsp;of the Catholic church. This generous lady served in the&nbsp;triple capacity of a mother, a friend, and a lover, to the new&nbsp;proselyte, whom, in fact, she regarded as her son. The necessity of procuring for himself some settlement, however,&nbsp;or perhaps his unsettled disposition, obliged Rousseau often&nbsp;to take leave of this tender mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He possessed more than ordinary talents for music ; and the Abbé Blanchard flattered his hopes of a place in the&nbsp;royal chapel, which he, however, failed in obtaining for&nbsp;him. He was therefore under the necessity of teaching&nbsp;music at Chamberi. He remained in this place till 1741,&nbsp;in which year he went to Paris, where he was long in very&nbsp;destitute circumstances. Writing to a friend in 1743, he&nbsp;thus expresses himself : “ Every thing is dear here, especially bread.” But he at length began to emerge from&nbsp;that obscurity in which he had hitherto been buried ; and&nbsp;his friends placed him with M. de Montaigne, ambassador&nbsp;from France to Venice. According to his own confession,&nbsp;a proud misanthropy, and a peculiar contempt of the riches&nbsp;and pleasures of this world, constituted the chief traits in&nbsp;his character ; and a misunderstanding soon took place between him and the ambassador. The place of depute, under M. Dupin, farmer-general, a man of considerable parts,&nbsp;gave him some temporary relief, and enabled him to be of&nbsp;some benefit to Madame de Warrens, his former benefactress. But the year 1750 proved the commencement of his&nbsp;literary career. The academy of Dijon had proposed the&nbsp;following question : “ Whether the revival of the arts and&nbsp;sciences has contributed to the refinement of manners ?”&nbsp;Rousseau at first inclined to support the affirmative. “ Take&nbsp;the negative side of the question,” said a philosopher, who&nbsp;was at that time his friend, “ and I’ll promise you the greatest success.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His discourse against the sciences having been found to be the best written, and replete with brilliant reasoning, was&nbsp;publicly crowned with the approbation of that learned body.&nbsp;Never was a paradox supported with greater eloquence.&nbsp;It was not however a new one ; but he enriched it with all&nbsp;the advantages which either knowledge or genius could&nbsp;confer upon it. Immediately after its appearance, he met&nbsp;with several opponents of his tenets, which he defended ;&nbsp;and, from one dispute to another, he found himself involved&nbsp;in a formidable train of correspondence, without having&nbsp;ever almost dreamed of such opposition. From that period&nbsp;he decreased in happiness as he increased in celebrity. His&nbsp;Discourse on the Causes of Inequality amongst Mankind,&nbsp;and on the Origin of Social Compacts, was written with a&nbsp;view to prove that mankind are equal ; that they were bom&nbsp;to live apart from each other ; and that they have perverted the order of nature in forming societies. He bestows&nbsp;the highest praise on the State of Nature, and deprecates&nbsp;the idea of every social compact. By presenting this performance to the magistrates of Geneva, he was received&nbsp;again into his native country, and reinstated in all the privileges and rights of a citizen, after having with much difficulty prevailed on himself to abjure the Catholic religion.&nbsp;He soon returned to France, however, and lived for some&nbsp;time in Paris. He afterwards gave himself up to retirement,&nbsp;partly to escape the shafts of criticism, and partly to follow&nbsp;the regimen which the strangury, with which he was afflicted,&nbsp;necessarily required. This is an important epoch in the history of his life, as it was owing to this circumstance, perhaps,&nbsp;that we have the most elegant works that have proceeded&nbsp;from his pen. His Letter to M. d’Alembert on the design&nbsp;of erecting a theatre at Geneva, written in his retirement,&nbsp;and published in the year 1757, contains, along with some&nbsp;paradoxes, some very important and well-handled truths.&nbsp;This letter first drew down upon him the envy of Voltaire,&nbsp;and was the cause of those indignities with which that author never ceased to load him. Although so great an enemy&nbsp;to theatrical representations, he caused a comedy to be printed ; and in 1752 he gave to the theatre a pastoral, called&nbsp;the Village Conjuror, of which he composed the poetry and&nbsp;the music, both of them abounding with sentiment and elegance, and full of innocent rural simplicity. His Dictionary of Music affords several excellent articles; some of&nbsp;them, however, are extremely inaccurate. “ This work,” says&nbsp;M. la Borde, in his Essay on Music, “ has need to be written over again, to save much trouble to those who wish to&nbsp;study it, and prevent them from falling into errors, which&nbsp;it is difficult to avoid, from the engaging manner in which&nbsp;Rousseau drags along his readers.” Soon after the rapid&nbsp;success of his Village Conjuror, he published a Letter on&nbsp;French Music, or rather against French Music, written with&nbsp;equal freedom and liveliness. The exasperated partisans&nbsp;of French comedy treated him with as much fury as if he&nbsp;had conspired against the state; and a crowd of enthusiasts&nbsp;spent their strength and outcries against him. He was insulted, menaced, and lampooned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That interesting and tender style which is so conspicuous throughout the Village Conjuror, animates several letters in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Heloise,</span><span class="font0"> which was published in 1761 in 12mo.&nbsp;This epistolary romance, of which the plot is ill managed,&nbsp;and the arrangement bad, like most other works of genius,&nbsp;has its beauties as well as its faults. Some of the letters are&nbsp;indeed admirable, from the force and warmth of expression,&nbsp;from an effervescence of sentiment, and from the irregularity&nbsp;of ideas which always characterize a passion carried to its&nbsp;height. In the Heloise, Rousseau’s unlucky talent of rendering every thing problematical appears very conspicuous.&nbsp;This is the case in his arguments in favour of and against&nbsp;duelling, which afford an apology for suicide, and a just&nbsp;condemnation of it; his facility in palliating the crime of&nbsp;adultery, and his strong reasons to make it abhorred ; his&nbsp;declamations against social happiness, and transports in favour of humanity; his violent rhapsodies against philosophers, and his rage for adopting their opinions ; the existence of God attacked by sophistry, and atheists confuted&nbsp;by the most irrefragable arguments; the Christian religion&nbsp;combated by the most specious objections, and celebrated&nbsp;by the most sublime eulogies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His Emilius afterwards made more noise than the New Heloise. This moral romance, which was published in the&nbsp;year 1762, in four volumes 12mo, treats chiefly of education. Rousseau washed to follow nature in every thing; and&nbsp;though his system in several places differs from received&nbsp;ideas, it deserves in many respects to be put in practice,&nbsp;and with some necessary modifications it has been so. His&nbsp;precepts are expressed with the force and dignity of a mind&nbsp;frill of the leading truths of morality. If he has not always</span></p>
