Then ML measured on the same scale will give the horizontal thrust, by which the strength of the tie-beam is to be regulated. GL will give the thrust which tends to crush the rafters, and LM will also give the force which tends to crush the strut-beam BC.</p><p>In like manner, to find the strain of the king-post BD of fig. 17, consider that each brace is pressed by half the weight of the roofing laid on BA or BC, and this pressure, or at least its hurtful effect, is diminished in the proportion of BA to DA, because the action of gravity is vertical, and the effect which we want to counteract by the braces is in a direction Ee perpendicular to BA or BC. But as this is to be resisted by the brace <hi rend="italic">f</hi>E acting in the direction ∕E, we must drawee perpendicular to Ee, and suppose the strain augmented in the proportion of Ee to <hi rend="italic">Ef.</hi></p><p>Having thus obtained in tons, pounds, or other measures, the strains which must be balanced at /by the cohesion of the king-post, take this measure from the scale of equal parts, and set it off in the directions of thc braces to G and H, and complete the parallelogram G/H K ; and∕K measured on the same scale will be the strain on the kingpost.</p><p>The artist may then examine the strength of his truss upon this principle, that every square inch of oak will bear at an average 7000 pounds compressing or stretching it, and may be safely loaded with 3500 for any length of time ; and that a square inch of fir will in like manner securely bear 2500. And, because straps are used to resist some of these strains, a square inch of well-wrought tough iron may be safely strained by 50,000 pounds. But the artist will always recollect, that we cannot have the same confidence in iron as in timber. The faults of this last are much more easily perceived ; and when the timber is too weak, it gives us warning of its failure by yielding sensibly before it breaks. This is not the case with iron ; and much of its service depends on the honesty of the blacksmith.</p><p>In this way may any design of a roof be examined. We shall here give the reader a sketch of two or three trussed roofs, which have been executed in the chief varieties of circumstances which occur in common practice.</p><p>Fig. 22 is the roof of St Paul’s Church, Covent Garden,</p><p>London, the work of Inigo Jones. Its construction is singular. The roof extends to a considerable distance beyond the building, and the ends of the tie-beams support the Tuscan corniche, appearing like the mutules of the Doric order. Such a roof could not rest on the tie-beam. Inigo Jones has therefore supported it by a truss below it ; and the height has allowed him to make this extremely strong with very little timber. It is accounted the highest roof of its width in London. But this was not difficult, by reason of the great height which its extreme width allowed him to employ without hurting the beauty of it by too high a pitch. The supports, however, are disposed with judgment.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>Fig. 23 is a kirb or mansarde roof by Price, and supposed to be of large dimensions, having braces to carry the middle of the rafters. It will serve exceedingly well for a church having pillars. The middle part of the tie-beam being taken away, the strains are very well balanced, so that there is no risk of its pushing aside the pillar on which it rests.</p><p>Fig. 24 is the celebrated roof of the Theatre of the University of Oxford, by Sir Christopher Wren. The span between the walls is 75 feet. This is accounted a very ingenious, and is a singular performance. The middle part of it is almost unchangeable in its form ; but from this circumstance it does not distribute the horizontal thrust with the same regularity as the usual construction. The horizontal thrust on the tie-beam is about twice the weight of the roof, and is withstood by an iron strap below the beam, which stretches the whole width of the building in the form of a rope, making part of the ornament of the ceiling.</p><p>In all the roofs which we have considered hitherto, the thrust is discharged entirely from the walls by the tie-beam. But this cannot always be done. We frequently want great elevation within, and arched ceilings. In such cases, it is a much more difficult matter to keep the walls free of all pressure outwards, and there are few buildings where it is completely done. Yet this is the greatest fault of a roof. We shall just point out the methods which may be most successfully adopted.</p><p>We have said that a tie-beam just performs tile office of a string. We have said the same of the king-post. Now suppose two rafters AB, BC (fig. 25), moveable about the point B, and rest</p><p>ing on the top of the walls. If</p><p>the line BD be suspended</p><p>from B, and the two lines</p><p>DA, DC be fastened to the</p><p>feet of the rafters, and if these</p><p>lines be incapable of exten</p><p>sion, it is plain that all thrust</p><p>is removed from the walls as</p><p>effectually as by a common</p><p>tie-beam ; and by shortening</p><p>BD to B<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, we gain a greater inside height, and more room for an arched ceiling. Now if we substitute a king-post BD (fig. 26), and two stretch</p><p>ers or hammer-beams DA, DC</p><p>for the other strings, and con</p><p>nect them firmly by means</p><p>of iron straps, we obtain our</p><p>purpose.</p><p>Let us compare this roof with a tie-beam roof in pomt of strain and strength. Recur to fig. 25, and complete the parallelogram ABCF, and draw the diagonals AC, BF, crossing in E. Draw BG perpendicular to CD.
