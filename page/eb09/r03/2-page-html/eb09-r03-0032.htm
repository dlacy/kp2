<p><span class="font1">been a political partisan and bad taken some part in making history before undertaking to write it; and he&nbsp;gives us, from the popular side, the views of a contemporary on the politics of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In following the development of Roman literature we have seen it become the prose organ of great affairs, but&nbsp;since the appearance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annals</span><span class="font1"> of Ennius, in whom&nbsp;the poetry of national life had originated, no work of&nbsp;great and original poetical genius had appeared. The&nbsp;powerful poetical force which for half a century continued&nbsp;to be the strongest force in literature, and which created&nbsp;masterpieces of art and genius, first revealed itself in the&nbsp;latter part of the Ciceronian age. The strength with&nbsp;which it burst forth seems indicative of latent sources of&nbsp;imaginative feeling and conception long suppressed in the&nbsp;Italian temperament, owing perhaps to the absorption of&nbsp;the mind and passion of the race in war, politics, and&nbsp;practical affairs. The conditions which enabled the poetic&nbsp;genius of Italy to come to maturity in the person of&nbsp;Lucretius (99-55) were entire seclusion from public life&nbsp;and absorption in the ideal pleasures of contemplation and&nbsp;artistic production. He produces the impression of a man&nbsp;so possessed by intellectual and imaginative enthusiasm as&nbsp;to have separated himself from the active interests and&nbsp;social pleasures of his time, and to have passed that period&nbsp;of his life which was given to literary production in studying the laws and watching the spectacle of nature, and in&nbsp;the active exercise of imaginative thought on the problems&nbsp;of human life. This isolation from the familiar ways of&nbsp;his contemporaries, while it was, according to tradition and&nbsp;the internal evidence of his poem, destructive to his spirit’s&nbsp;health, resulted in a work of genius, unique in character,&nbsp;which was a second birth of imaginative poetry in Italy,&nbsp;and still stands forth as the greatest philosophical poem&nbsp;in any language. In the form of his poem he followed a&nbsp;Greek original; and the stuff out of which the texture of&nbsp;his philosophical argument is framed was derived from&nbsp;Greek science; but all that is of deep human and poetical&nbsp;meaning in the poem is his own. His sense of the grace&nbsp;and beauty of language had indeed been educated by&nbsp;the sympathetic study of Homer and Euripides; but the&nbsp;philosophical guidance which he followed and his reverence&nbsp;for his guide were rather a hindrance than an aid to his&nbsp;art, and were the cause of his presenting the pure ore of&nbsp;his own genius overlaid with great masses of alien alloy.&nbsp;While we recognize in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De llerum Natura</span><span class="font1"> some of the&nbsp;most powerful poetry in any language and feel that few&nbsp;poets have penetrated with such passionate sincerity and&nbsp;courage into the secret of nature and some of the deeper&nbsp;truths of human life, we must acknowledge that, as compared with the great didactic poem of Virgil, it is crude&nbsp;and unformed in artistic design, and often rough and unequal in artistic execution. Yet, apart altogether from&nbsp;its independent value, by his speculative power and&nbsp;enthusiasm, by his revelation of the life and spectacle of&nbsp;nature, by the fresh creativeness of his diction and the&nbsp;elevated movement of his rhythm, he exercised a more&nbsp;powerful influence than any other on the art of his more&nbsp;perfect successors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the imaginative and emotional side of Roman poetry was so powerfully represented by Lucretius, attention was directed to its artistic side by a younger generation, who moulded themselves in a great degree, though&nbsp;not exclusively, on Alexandrian models. Of this small&nbsp;group of poets, who were bound together by common&nbsp;tastes and friendship, one only has survived, fortunately&nbsp;the man of most genius among them, Valerius Catullus&nbsp;(84@@<sup>1</sup>-54). He too was a new force in Roman literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The reasons for accepting 84 rather than 87 as the date of his birth have been given in the article Catullus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although of a family probably originally Roman, and although brought early in his career into intimate relations with members of the great Roman families, he was a&nbsp;provincial by birth, and was apparently moved in his&nbsp;earliest youth by that fresh enthusiasm for culture which&nbsp;in his own and the following generation enabled Cisalpine&nbsp;Gaul to do so much to enrich Roman literature. His&nbsp;nature, in which sensuous passion and warm affection were&nbsp;united, made him fall a victim to the fascinations of the&nbsp;famous Clodia, whom -he has celebrated, under the name&nbsp;of Lesbia, in some of the most powerful and charming love&nbsp;poetry found in any language. The subjects of his best&nbsp;art are taken immediately from his own life,—his loves,&nbsp;his friendships, his travels, his animosities, personal and&nbsp;political. His most original contribution to the substance&nbsp;of Roman literature was that he first shaped into poetry&nbsp;the experience of his own heart, as it had been shaped by&nbsp;Alcaeus and Sappho in the early days of Greek poetry.&nbsp;No poet has surpassed him in the power of vitally reproducing the pleasure and pain of the passing hour, not&nbsp;recalled by idealizing reflexion as in Horace, nor overlaid&nbsp;with mythological ornament as in Propertius, but in all&nbsp;the keenness of immediate impression. He also introduced&nbsp;into Roman literature that personal as distinct from political or social satire which appears later in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ejwdes</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Horace and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epigrams</span><span class="font1"> of Martial. The sting in&nbsp;Catullus, at least in his iambics and phalsecians, is more&nbsp;concentrated than in the later writers. He anticipated&nbsp;Ovid in recalling the stories of Greek mythology into a&nbsp;second poetical life. His greatest contribution to poetic&nbsp;art consisted in the perfection which he attained in the&nbsp;phalsecian, the pure iambic, and the scazon metres, and in&nbsp;the ease and grace with which he used the language of&nbsp;familiar intercourse, as distinct from that of the creative&nbsp;imagination, of the “ rostra,” and of the schools, to give at&nbsp;once a lifelike and an artistic expression to his feelings.&nbsp;He has the interest of being the last poet of the free republic. In his life and in his art he was the precursor of&nbsp;those poets who used their genius as the interpreter and&nbsp;minister of pleasure; but he rises above them in the spirit&nbsp;of personal independence, in his affection for his friends,&nbsp;in his keen enjoyment of natural and simple pleasures, and&nbsp;in his power of giving vital expression to these feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Third Period : Augustan Age,</span><span class="font1"> 42 b.c. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> 17 a.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The poetic impulse and culture communicated to Roman literature in the last years of the republic passed on without any break of continuity into the literature of the&nbsp;succeeding age. One or two of the circle of Catullus survived into that age ; but an entirely new spirit came over&nbsp;the literature of the new period, and it is by new men,&nbsp;educated indeed under the same literary influences, but&nbsp;living in an altered world and belonging originally to a&nbsp;different order in the state, that the new spirit was expressed. The literature of the later republic reflects the&nbsp;sympathies and prejudices of an aristocratic class, sharing&nbsp;in the conduct of national affairs and living on terms of&nbsp;equality with one another ;* that of the Augustan age, both&nbsp;in its early serious enthusiasm and in the licence and levity&nbsp;of its later development, represents the hopes and aspirations with which the new monarchy was ushered into the&nbsp;world, and the pursuit of pleasure and amusement, which&nbsp;becomes the chief interest of a class cut off from the higher&nbsp;energies of practical life, and moving in the refining and&nbsp;enervating atmosphere of an imperial court. The great&nbsp;inspiring influence of the new literature was the enthusiasm produced first by the hope and afterwards by the fulfilment of the restoration of peace, order, national glory,&nbsp;under the rule of Augustus. All that the age longed for&nbsp;seemed to be embodied in a man who had both in his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
