            <p>collection of divine ſongs. The Chriſtian church has from the beginning made them a
                principal part of her holy ſervices; and in the primitive times it was almoſt a
                general rule that every biſhop, prieſt, and religious perſon, ſhould have the
                pſalter by heart.</p>
            <p>Many learned fathers, and not a few of the moderns, have maintained that <hi
                    rend="italic">David</hi> was the author of them all. Several are of a different
                opinion, and inſiſt that David wrote only 72 of them; and that thoſe without titles
                are to be aſcribed to the authors oſ the preceding pſalms, whoſe names are affixed
                to them. Thoſe who ſuppoſe that David alone was the author, contend, that in the New
                Teſtament, and in the language of the church universal, they are expreſsly called
                the <hi rend="italic">Pſalms oſ David. </hi>That David was the principal author of
                theſe hymns is univerſally acknowledged, and therefore the whole collection may
                properly enough go under his name; but that he wrote them all, is a palpable
                miſtake. Nothing certain can be gathered from the titles of the pſalms; for although
                unqueſtionably very ancient, yet authors are not agreed as to their authority, and
                they differ as much about their ſignification. The Hebrew doctors generally agree
                that the 92d pſalm was compoſed by Adam; an opinion which for many reaſons we are
                not inclined to adopt. There ſeems, however, to be no doubt but that ſome of them
                were written by Moſes; that Solomon was the author of the 49th; and that others were
                occaſioned by events long poſterior to the flouriſhing era of the kingdom of Judah.
                The 137th particularly is one of thoſe which mentions the captivity of Babylon.</p>
            <p>The following arrangement of the Pſalms, after a careful and judicious examination,
                has been adopted by Calmet.</p>
            <p>1. Eight Pſalms of which the date is uncertain, <hi rend="italic">viz. 1</hi>, 4, 19,
                81, 91, 110, 139, 145. The firſt of theſe was compoſed by David or Ezra, and was
                ſung in the temple at the feaſt of trumpets held in the beginning of the year and at
                the feaſt of tabernacles. The 81ſt is attributed to Aſaph, and 110th to David. The
                authors of the reſt are unknown.</p>
            <p>2. The Pſalms compoſed by David during the persecution of Saul. Theſe are ſeventeen,
                11, 31, 34, 56, 16, 54, 52, 109, 17, 22, 35, 57, 58, 142, 140, 141, 7.</p>
            <p>3. The Pſalms compoſed by David at the beginning of his reign, and after the death of
                Saul. Theſe are ſixteen, 2,9, 24, 63, 101, 29, 20, 21, 28, 39, 40, 41, 6, 51, 32,
                33.</p>
            <p>4. The Pſalms written by David during the rebellion of Abialom are eight in number;
                3, 4, 53, 62, 70, 71, 143, 144.</p>
            <p>5. The Pſalms written between the death of Abſalom and the captivity, which are ten,
                18, 30, 72, 47, 78, 82, 83, 76, 74, 79: of theſe David wrote only three; 18, 30, and
                72.</p>
            <p>6. The Pſalms compoſed during the captivity, which amount to forty. Theſe were
                chiefly compoſed by the of Rendants of Aſaph and Korah: they are, 10, 12, 13, 14,
                53, 15, 25, 26, 27, 28, 36, 37, 42, 43, 44, 49, 50, 60, 64, 69, 73, 75, 77, 80, 84,
                86, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 99, 120, 121, 123, 130, 131, 132.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Thoſe hymns of joy and thankſgiving, written upon the releaſe from the
                Babyloniſh captivity, and at the building and dedication of the temple. Theſe are,
                122, 61, 63, 124, 23, 87, 85, 46, 47, 48, from 96 to 117 incluſive, 126, 133 to 137
                incluſive, 149, 150, 146, 147, 148, 59, 65, 66, 67, 118, 125,</p>
            <p>127, 128, 129, 138. According to this diſtribution, only 45 are poſitively aſſigned
                to David.</p>
            <p>Joſephus, and moſt of the ancient writers, aſſert, that the Pſalms were compoſed in
                numbers: little, however, reſpecting the nature and principles of the Hebrew
                verſification is known.</p>
            <p>There exiſted a certain kind of poetry among the Hebrews, principally intended, it
                ſhould ſeem, for the aſſiſtance of the memory; in which, when there was little
                connection between the ſentiments, a fort of order or method was preſerved, by the
                initial letters oſ each line or ſtanza following the order of the alphabet. Of this
                there are ſeveral examples extant among the ſacred poems @@(I); and in theſe
                examples the verſes are ſo exactly marked and defined, that it is impoſſible to
                miſtake them for proſe; and particularly if we attentively conſider the verſes, and
                compare them with one another, ſince they are in general ſo regularly accommodated,
                that word anſwers to word, and almoſt ſyllable to ſyllable. This being the caſe,
                though an appeal can ſcarcely be made to the ear on this occaſion, the eye itſelf
                will diſtinguiſh. the poetic diviſion and arrangement, and alſo that ſome labour and
                accuracy has been employed in adapting the words to the meaſure.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew poetry has likewiſe another property altogether peculiar to metrical
                compoſition. It admits foreign words and certain particles, which ſeldom occur in
                proſe compoſition, and thus forms a diſtinct poetical dialect. One or two of the
                peculiarities alſo of the Hebrew verſification it may be proper to remark, which as
                they are very obſervable in thoſe poems in which the verſes are defined by the
                initial letters, may at leaſt be reaſonably conjectured of the reſt. The firſt of
                theſe is, that the verſes are very unequal in length; the ſhorteſt conſifting oſ ſix
                or ſeven ſyllables; the longeſt extending to about twice that number: the ſame poem
                is, however, generally continued throughout in verſes not very unequal to each
                other. It muſt alfo be obſerved, that the cloſe of the verſe generally falls where
                the members of the ſentences are divided.</p>
            <p>But although nothing certain can be defined concerning the metre of the particular
                verſes, there is yet another artifice of poetry to be remarked of them when in a
                collective ſtate, when ſeveral of thcm are taken together. In the Hebrew poetry, as
                is before remarked, there may be obſerved a certain conformation of the ſentences ;
                the nature of which is, that a complete ſenſe is almoſt equally infuſed into every
                component part, and that every member conſtitutes an entire verſe. So that as the
                poems divide themſelves in a manner ſpontane- ouſly into periods, for the moſt part
                equal; ſo the periods themſelves are divided into verſes, moſt common-</p>
