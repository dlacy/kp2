<p><span class="font0">RUFUS, GAIUS VALGIUS, Lain poet, friend of Horace and Maecenas, and consul in 12 b.c. He was known as a&nbsp;writer of elegies and epigrams, and his contemporaries believed&nbsp;him capahle of great things in epic. The author of the panegyric on Messalla declares Rufus to be the only poet fitted to&nbsp;be the great man’s Homer. Rufus did not, however, confine&nbsp;himself to poetry. He discussed grammatical questions by&nbsp;correspondence, translated the rhetorical manual of his teacher&nbsp;Apollodorus of Pergamum, and began a treatise on medicinal&nbsp;plants, dedicated to Augustus. Horace addressed to him the&nbsp;ninth ode of the second book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUFUS, LUCIUS VARIUS (c 74-14 b.c.), Roman poet of the Augustan age. He was the friend of Virgil, after whose&nbsp;death he and Plotius Tucca prepared the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span><span class="font0"> for publication, and of Horace, for whom he and Virgil obtained an introduction to Maecenas.

<p><span class="font0">RUG, a term of Scandinavian origin (cf.

<p><span class="font0">RUGBY, a market town in the Rugby parliamentary division of Warwickshire, England, finely situated on a tableland&nbsp;rising from the S. bank of the Avon, near the Oxford Canal.&nbsp;Pop. of urban district (1901), 16,830. It is an important&nbsp;junction on the London &amp; North-Western railway, by which&nbsp;it is 82J m. N.W. from London; it is served also by the Great&nbsp;Central railway and by a branch of the Midland railway from&nbsp;Leicester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The boys’ school, ranking as one of the most famous public schools in England, was founded and endowed under the will&nbsp;(1567) of Laurence Sheriff, a merchant grocer and servant to&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth, and a native either of Rugby or of the neighbouring village of Brownsover. The endowment consisted of&nbsp;the parsonage of Brownsover, Sheriff’s mansion house in Rugby,&nbsp;and one-third (8 acres) of his estate in Middlesex, near the&nbsp;Foundling Hospital, London, which, being let on building&nbsp;leases, gradually increased to about £5000 a year. The full&nbsp;endowment was obtained in 1653. The school originally&nbsp;stood opposite the parish church, and was removed to its&nbsp;present site on the S. side of the town between 1740 and 1750.&nbsp;In 1809 it was rebuilt from designs by Henry Hakewill (1771-1830); the chapel, dedicated to St Lawrence, was added in&nbsp;1820. At the tercentenary of the school in 1867 subscriptions&nbsp;were set on foot for founding scholarships, building additional&nbsp;schoolrooms, rebuilding or enlarging the chapel and other&nbsp;objects. The chapel was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1872,&nbsp;and further additions were made in 1898. A swimming bath&nbsp;was erected in 1876; the Temple observatory, containing a&nbsp;fine equatorial refractor by Alvan Clark, was built in 1877,&nbsp;and the Temple reading-room with the art museum in 1878.&nbsp;The workshops underneath the gymnasium were opened in&nbsp;1880, and a new big school and class-rooms were erected in&nbsp;1885. From about 70 to 1777 the numbers attending the&nbsp;school have increased to nearly 600. A great impulse was&nbsp;given to the progress of the school during the headmastership&nbsp;of Thomas Arnold, 1827-42. Among Arnold’s successors were&nbsp;Archibald Campbell Tait and Frederick Temple, both afterwards archbishops of Canterbury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The parish church of St Andrew was rebuilt from designs by W. Butterfield and reconsecrated in 1879. A tower and&nbsp;spire were added in 1895. An aisle commemorates John&nbsp;Moultrie (1799-1874), rector, widely known as the “ poet&nbsp;pastor.” The church of Holy Trinity is by Sir G. G. Scott,&nbsp;and the Roman Catholic church of St Marie by A. W. Pugin.&nbsp;Trade is mainly agricultural; there is a large cattle market,&nbsp;and several fairs are held annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The early history of Rugby is obscure, but a settlement of the Danes is presumed from the name, and from the neighbouring tract&nbsp;of Dunsmore Heath (Danesmoor). Rugby was originally a hamlet&nbsp;of the adjoining parish of Clifton-on-Dunsmore? and is separately&nbsp;treated of as such in Domesday Book. Ernaldus de Bosco (Ernald&nbsp;de Bois), lord of the manor of Clifton, seems to have erected the&nbsp;first chapel in Rugby, in the reign of Stephen, about 1140. It&nbsp;was afterwards granted by him, with certain lands, to endow the&nbsp;abbey of St Mary, Leicester, which grant was confirmed by his&nbsp;successors and by royal charter of Henry II. In the second year&nbsp;of King John (1200) a suit took place between Henry de Rokeby,&nbsp;lord of the manor of Rugby, and Paul, abbot of St Mary, Leicester,&nbsp;which resulted in the former obtaining possession of the advowson&nbsp;of Rugby, on condition of homage and service to the abbot of&nbsp;Leicester. By virtue of this agreement the chapel was converted&nbsp;into a parish church and the vicarage into a rectory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUGE, ARNOLD (1802-1880), German philosopher and political writer, was born at Bergen, in the island of Rügen,&nbsp;on the 13th of September 1802. He studied at Halle, Jena&nbsp;and Heidelberg, and became an adherent of the party which&nbsp;sought to create a free and united Germany. For his zeal he&nbsp;was confined for five years in the fortress of Kolberg, where he&nbsp;studied Plato and the Greek poets. On his release in 1830&nbsp;he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Schill und die Seinen,</span><span class="font0"> a tragedy, and a translation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oedipus in Colonus.</span><span class="font0"> Ruge settled in Halle, where in 1837&nbsp;with E. T. Echtermeyer he founded the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hallesche Jahrbücher&nbsp;für deutsche Kunst und Wissenschaft.</span><span class="font0"> In this periodical he&nbsp;discussed the questions of the time from the point of view of&nbsp;the Hegelian philosophy. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbücher</span><span class="font0"> was detested by the&nbsp;orthodox party in Prussia; and was finally suppressed by&nbsp;the Saxon government in 1843. In Paris Ruge tried to act&nbsp;with Karl Marx as co-editor of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher,</span><span class="font0"> but had little sympathy with Marx’s socialistic theories,&nbsp;and soon left him. In the revolutionary movement of 1848&nbsp;he organized the Extreme Left in the Frankfort parliament,&nbsp;and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;Reform.</span><span class="font0"> The Prussian government intervened and Ruge soon&nbsp;afterwards left for Paris, hoping, through his friend Alexandre&nbsp;Ledru-Rollin, to establish relations between German and&nbsp;French republicans; but in 1849 both Ledru-Rollin and Ruge&nbsp;had to take refuge in London. Here, in company with Giuseppe&nbsp;Mazzini and other advanced politicians, they formed a “ European Democratic Committee.” From this Ruge soon withdrew,&nbsp;and in 1850 went to Brighton, where he supported himself&nbsp;by teaching and writing. In 1866 and 1870 he vigorously</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
