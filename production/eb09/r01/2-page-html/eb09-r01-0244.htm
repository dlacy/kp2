<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Passing over eighteen centuries we find the knowledge of Reptiles to have remained as stationary as other branches&nbsp;of natural history, perhaps even more so. The Reptile&nbsp;fauna of Europe was not extensive enough to attract the&nbsp;energy of a Belon or Rondelet; popular prejudice and the&nbsp;difficulty of preserving these animals deterred from their&nbsp;study; nor was the mind of man sufficiently educated&nbsp;not to give implicit credence to the fabulous tales with&nbsp;which every account of Reptiles in the 15th and 16th&nbsp;centuries was replete. The art of healing, however, was&nbsp;developing into a science based upon rational principles,&nbsp;and consequently not only those Reptiles which formed&nbsp;part of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">materia medica</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> but also the venomous Snakes&nbsp;became objects of study to the physician. Snakes, and&nbsp;especially the Viper, were treated of in distinct divisions&nbsp;of general works, or in separate monographs. It is true&nbsp;that these treatises were written less with the view of&nbsp;elucidating the natural history of the animals than with&nbsp;that of describing their poisonous nature and indicating&nbsp;the manner in which they should be used as medicaments,&nbsp;the majority of the writers being ignorant of the structure&nbsp;of the venom-apparatus, and of the distinction between&nbsp;non-venomous and venomous Snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Nothing can show more clearly the small advance made by herpetology in this long post-Aristotelian period than&nbsp;a glance at the celebrated work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De Differentiis Animalium&nbsp;Libri decern</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Paris, 1552), by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Edward Wotton </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1492-1555). Wotton treats of the Reptiles which he designates&nbsp;as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Quadrupedes oviparx et Serpentes</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the sixth book of his&nbsp;work. They form the second division of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Quadrupedes&nbsp;qux sanguinem habent,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and are subdivided in the following&nbsp;“ genera ” :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crocodilus etscincus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cap. cv.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testudinum genera</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cvi.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ran-arum genera</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cvii.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lacertx</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cviii.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salamandra et seps quad-rupee</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cix.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stellio</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cx.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chamxleo</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxi.) ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Serpentes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxii.), a general account, the following being different kinds of Serpents :&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Hydrus et alii quidam serpentes aquatiles</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxiii.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Serpentes&nbsp;terrestres et primo aspidum genera</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxiv.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vipera, dipsas, cerastes, et hammodytes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxv.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">); Hxmorrlius, sepedon, seps, cenchris,&nbsp;et cenchrites</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxvi.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Basiliscus et alii quidam serpentes quorum&nbsp;venenum remedio caret</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxvii.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Draco, amphishxna, et alii quidam&nbsp;serpentes quorum morsus minus affert periculi</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (cxviii.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As regards the treatment of the subject, Wotton’s work might with propriety be termed “Aristoteles redivivus.”&nbsp;The plan is the same, and the observations of the Greek&nbsp;naturalist are faithfully, sometimes literally, reproduced.&nbsp;It is surprising that even the Reptiles of his native country&nbsp;were most imperfectly known to the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A new impetus for the cultivation of the study of natural history was given through the observations and&nbsp;writings of travellers in India, Africa, and America.&nbsp;With the enlargement of geographical knowledge that of&nbsp;Reptiles was also advanced, as is sufficiently apparent from&nbsp;the large encyclopaedic works of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Gesner, Aldrovandi, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and&nbsp;J</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ohnston. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The last-named author especially, who published&nbsp;the various portions of his natural history in the middle&nbsp;of the 17th century, was able to embody in his compilations notices of numerous Reptiles observed by Francisco&nbsp;Hernandez in Mexico and by Marcgrave and Piso in Brazil.&nbsp;As the author had no definite idea of the Ray-Linnsean&nbsp;term “ species,” it is not possible to give the exact number&nbsp;of Reptiles mentioned in his work. But it may be&nbsp;estimated at about fifty, not including some marine fishes&nbsp;and fabulous creatures. He figures (or rather reproduces&nbsp;the figures of) about forty,—some species being represented&nbsp;by several figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Linnxan Period : Formation of a Class Amphibia</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.— Within the century which succeeded these compilatory&nbsp;works (1650-1750) fall the labours which prepared the&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>ay for and exerted the greatest influence on Ray and&nbsp;Linnaeus. Although original researches in the field ol&nbsp;herpetology were limited in extent and in number, the&nbsp;authors had freed themselves from the purely literary oi&nbsp;scholastic tendency. Men were no longer satisfied wit!&nbsp;reproducing and commenting on the writings of their predecessors ; the pen was superseded by the eye, the micro&nbsp;scope, and the knife, and statements were tested by&nbsp;experiment. This spirit of the age manifested itself, sc&nbsp;far as the Reptiles are concerned, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Chara’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Redi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">admirable observations on the Yiper, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Major’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Val&nbsp;lisnieri’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">detailed accounts of the anatomy of the Chamte&nbsp;leon, in the researches of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jacob.eus </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">into the metamor&nbsp;phoses of the Batrachians and the structure of Lizards, ir&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dufay’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">history of the development of the Salamander (foi&nbsp;Batrachians are invariably associated with Reptiles proper)&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Tyson’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">description of the anatomy of the Rattlesnake&nbsp;&lt;fec. The natural history collections formed by institution!&nbsp;and wealthy individuals now contained not merely skin!&nbsp;of Crocodiles or Serpents stuffed and transformed into i&nbsp;shape to correspond with the fabulous descriptions of tin&nbsp;ancient dragons; but, with the discovery of alcohol as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">means of preserving animals, Reptiles entire or dissectec&nbsp;were exhibited for study; and no opportunity was lost o&nbsp;obtaining them from travellers or residents in foreigr&nbsp;countries. Fossils also were now acknowledged to be re&nbsp;mains of animals which had lived before the flood, anc&nbsp;some of them were recognized as those of Reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The contributions to a positive knowledge of the anima kingdom became so numerous as to render the need of £&nbsp;methodical arrangement of the abundance of new facts&nbsp;more and more pressing. Of the two principal systematic&nbsp;attempts made in this period the first ranks as one of the&nbsp;most remarkable steps of the progress of natural history&nbsp;whilst the second can only be designated as a signal failure,&nbsp;which ought to have been a warning to all those who in aftei&nbsp;years classified animals in what is called an “artificial system.” As the latter attempt, originating with </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Klein </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1685-1759), did not exercise any further influence on herpetology, it will be sufficient to have merely mentioned it.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">John Ray </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1628-1705) had recognized the necessity of introducing exact definitions for the several categories into&nbsp;which the animals had to be divided, and he maintained&nbsp;that these categories ought to be characterized by the&nbsp;structure of animals, and that all zoological knowledge&nbsp;had to start from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> species ” as its basis. His definition of Reptiles as “ animalia sanguinea pulmofie respirantia&nbsp;cor unico tantum ventriculo instructum habentia ovipara ”&nbsp;fixed the class in a manner which was adopted by the&nbsp;naturalists of the succeeding hundred and fifty years.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Ray was not a herpetologist; he never&nbsp;made these animals his special study, as is evident from&nbsp;the way in which he subdivides the class, as well as from&nbsp;his imperfect treatment of the species. His knowledge of&nbsp;Reptiles is chiefly derived from the researches of others,&nbsp;from whose accounts, however, everything not based upon&nbsp;reliable demonstration is critically excluded. He begins&nbsp;with a chapter treating of Frogs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Dana,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> with two&nbsp;species), Toads (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bufo</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, with one species), and Tortoises@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> In associating Tortoises with Toads Ray could not disengage himself from the general popular view as to the nature of these animals, which found expression in the German </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Schildkröte</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (“ Shield-toad ”).</span></p>
