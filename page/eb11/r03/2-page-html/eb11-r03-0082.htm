He wrote also accounts of ancient schools of&nbsp;philosophy, the Ionians, the Pythagoreans and the Megarians.&nbsp;Beside these important historical works, he published a large&nbsp;number of treatises of which the following may be mentioned:&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Versuch zur Verständigung über die neueste deutsche Philosophie&nbsp;zeit Kant</span><span class="font0"> (1853); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die christliche Philosophie bis auf die&nbsp;neuesten Zeiten</span><span class="font0"> (2 vols., 1858-59), a work which supplemented&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte; Abriss der philosophischen Logik</span><span class="font0"> (1824);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ueber das Verhältnis der Philosophie zum Leben</span><span class="font0"> (1835);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historia philosophiae Graeco-Romanae</span><span class="font0"> (in collaboration with&nbsp;Preller, 1838; 7th ed., 1888); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kleine philosophische Schriften&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1839-40); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">System der Logik und Metaphysik</span><span class="font0"> (1856);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyklopadie der philosophischen Wissenschaften</span><span class="font0"> (1862-64);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ernest Renan, über die Naturwissenschaften und die Geschichte&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1865); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ueber das Bose und seine Folgen</span><span class="font0"> (1869).

<p><span class="font0">RITTER, KARL (1779-1859), German geographer, was born at Quedlinburg on the 7th of August 1779, and died in Berlin&nbsp;on the 28th of September 1859. His father, a physician, left&nbsp;his family in straitened circumstances, and Karl was received&nbsp;into the Schnepfenthal institution then just founded by&nbsp;Christian Gotthilf Salzmann (1744-1811) for the purpose of&nbsp;testing his educational theories. The Salzmann system was&nbsp;practically that of Rousseau; conformity to natural law&nbsp;and enlightenment were its watchwords; great attention was&nbsp;given to practical life; and the modem languages were&nbsp;carefully taught, to the complete exclusion of Latin and Greek.&nbsp;Ritter already showed geographical aptitude, and when his&nbsp;schooldays were drawing to a close his future course was&nbsp;determined by an introduction to Bethmann Hollweg, a banker&nbsp;in Frankfort. It was arranged that Ritter should become&nbsp;tutor to Hollweg’s children, but that in the meantime he should&nbsp;attend the university at his patron’s expense. His duties as&nbsp;tutor in the Hollweg family began at Frankfort in 17^8 and&nbsp;continued for fifteen years. The years 1814-19, which he&nbsp;spent at Göttingen in order still to watch over the welfare&nbsp;of his pupils, were those in which he began to devote himself exclusively to geographical inquiries. He had already&nbsp;travelled extensively in Europe when in 1817-18 he brought&nbsp;out his first masterpiece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Erdkunde im Verhältnis zur&nbsp;Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 2 vols., 1817-1818). In 1819 he became professor of history at Frankfort,&nbsp;and in 1820 professor extraordinarius of history at Berlin,&nbsp;where shortly afterwards he began also to lecture at the military&nbsp;college. He remained in this position till his death. The&nbsp;second edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erdkunde</span><span class="font0"> (1822-58) was conceived on a&nbsp;much larger scale than the first, but he completed only the&nbsp;sections on Africa and the various countries of Asia. The&nbsp;service rendered to geography by Ritter was especially notable&nbsp;because he brought to his work a new conception of the subject.&nbsp;Geography was, to use his own expression, a kind of physiology&nbsp;and comparative anatomy of the earth: rivers, mountains,&nbsp;glaciers, &amp;c., were so many distinct organs, each with its own&nbsp;appropriate functions; and, as his physical frame is the basis&nbsp;of the man, determinative to a large extent of his life, so the&nbsp;structure of each country is a leading element in the historic&nbsp;progress of the nation. Moreover, Ritter was a scientific&nbsp;compiler of the first rank. Among his minor works may be&nbsp;mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vorhalle europäischer Volkergeschichten vor Herodot&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Berlin, 1820); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Stupas ... an der Indobaktrischen&nbsp;Konigsstrasse und die Kolosse von Bamiyan</span><span class="font0"> (1838); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Einleitung&nbsp;zur allgemeinen vergleichenden Geographie</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 1852);&nbsp;“ Bemerkungen über Veranschaulichungsmittel räumlicher Verhältnisse bei graphischen Darstellungen durch Form u. Zahl,”&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trans,</span><span class="font0"> of the Berlin Academy, 1828. After his death selections from his lectures were published under the titles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte&nbsp;der Erdkunde</span><span class="font0"> (1861), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Allgemeine Erdkunde</span><span class="font0"> (1862), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Europa&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1863). Several of his works </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the “ Palestine ” volumes&nbsp;of his Erdkunde) were translated into English. “ Karl Ritter ”&nbsp;foundations were established Jn his memory at Berlin and&nbsp;Leipzig, for the furtherance of geographical study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">See G. Kramer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Karl Ritter, ein Lebensbild</span><span class="font0"> (Halle, 1864 and 1870; 2nd ed., 1875); W. L. Gage, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Life of Kart Ritter</span><span class="font0"> (London, 1867);&nbsp;F. Marthe, “ Was bedeutet Karl Ritter für die Geographie/’ in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitsch. der Ges. f. Erdk.</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 1879). All Ritter’s works mentioned&nbsp;above were published at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITUAL (from Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ritus,</span><span class="font0"> a custom, especially a religious rite or custom), a term of religion, which may be defined as&nbsp;the routine of worship. This is a “ minimum definition ”;&nbsp;“ ritual ” at least means so much, but may stand for more.&nbsp;Without some sort of ritual there could be no organized method&nbsp;in religious worship. Indeed, viewed in this aspect, ritual is&nbsp;to religion what habit is to life, and its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rationale</span><span class="font0"> is similar,&nbsp;namely, that by bringing subordinate functions under an effortless rule it permits undivided attention in regard to vital issues.&nbsp;This analogy—for it is safer to regard such applications of&nbsp;individual psychology to social phenomena as only analogies—&nbsp;may be carried a step further. Just as the main business of&nbsp;habit is to secure bodily equilibrium in order to allow free&nbsp;play to the mental life, so the chief task of routine in religion&nbsp;is to organize the activities necessary to its stability and continuance as a social institution, in order that all available&nbsp;spontaneity and initiative may be directed into spiritual&nbsp;channels. Such organization will naturally affect far more&nbsp;than the forms of worship; but these at least, to judge from&nbsp;the past history of religion, cannot but submit extensively&nbsp;to its influence. The nature of religion, as the sociologist understands it, is bound up with its congregational character.&nbsp;In order that inter-subjective relations should be maintained&nbsp;between fellow-worshippers, the use of one or another set of&nbsp;conventional symbols is absolutely required; for example,&nbsp;an intelligible vocabulary of meet expressions, or (since this&nbsp;is, perhaps, not indispensable) at any rate sounds, sights,&nbsp;actions and so on, that have come by prescription to signify&nbsp;the common purpose of the religious society, and the means&nbsp;taken in common for the realization of that purpose. In this&nbsp;sense, the term “ ritual,” as meaning the prescribed ceremonial&nbsp;routine, is also extended to observances not strictly religious in&nbsp;character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, whilst ritual at least represents routine, it tends, his-toricafly speaking, to have a far deeper significance for the religious consciousness. A recurrent feature of religion, which&nbsp;many students of its phenomena would even consider constant&nbsp;and typical, is the attribution of a more or less self-contained&nbsp;and automatic efficacy to the ritual procedure as such. Before&nbsp;proceeding to considerations of genesis, it will be convenient&nbsp;briefly to analyse the notion as it appears in the higher religions.&nbsp;Two constituent lines of thought may be distinguished. Firstly,&nbsp;there is the tendency to pass beyond the purely petitionary&nbsp;attitude which as such can imply no more than the desire,&nbsp;hope or expectation of divine favour, and to take for granted&nbsp;the consummation sought, a deity that answers, a grace and&nbsp;blessing that are communicated. Only when such accomplishment of its end is assumed can efficacy be held to attach to&nbsp;the act of worship. Secondly, there is the tendency to identify&nbsp;such a self-accomplishing act of worship with its objective&nbsp;expression in the ritual that for purposes of mutual understanding makes the body of worshippers one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Magical Element in Ritual.—</span><span class="font0">Exactly similar tendencies— to impute efficacy, and to treat the ritual procedure as the&nbsp;source of that efficacy—are typically characteristic of magic,&nbsp;and their reappearance in religion can hardly be treated as a&nbsp;coincidence, seeing that magic and religion would appear to&nbsp;have much in common, at any rate during the earlier stages&nbsp;of their development. In magic a suggestion is made orally,&nbsp;or by dramatic action, or most often in both ways together,&nbsp;that is held </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso facto</span><span class="font0"> to bring about its owm accomplishment.&nbsp;A certain conditionality attaches to the magical Operation,&nbsp;inasmuch as each magician is subject to interference on the&nbsp;part of other magicians who may neutralize his spell by a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
