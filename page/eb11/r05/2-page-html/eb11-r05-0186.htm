<p><span class="font0">Bulgarian troops joining the garrison on the Shipka. Suleiman remained at Yeni Zagra till the 17 th of August, when&nbsp;he set out for the Shipka. On August 21st the heights&nbsp;east of the pass were taken, and during the next&nbsp;few days there was desperate fighting; but the original&nbsp;garrison was gradually reinforced, and the Russians&nbsp;held on. In this fighting the Russian losses amounted to close on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4000, while the Turkish casualties were about treble that number. Suleiman now intrenched himself close to the Russian position,&nbsp;and there he remained till Sept. 17th, when after a three&nbsp;days’ bombardment he again assaulted the position, but was&nbsp;repulsed with considerable loss. This was the last assault made&nbsp;on the Russian position. Suleiman replaced Mehemet Ali as&nbsp;commander-in-chief on Oct. 2nd, and was himself succeeded&nbsp;by Reouf Pasha. Thus, under orders from Constantinople,&nbsp;Suleiman frittered away his opportunity and his army in a&nbsp;fruitless attempt to retake the Shipka Pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not till the middle of August that Mehemet Ali decided to move against the Russians and ordered an advance. The&nbsp;Cesarevich (afterwards Alexander III.), who was&nbsp;opposing him with the XI., XII. and XIII. Corps, in&nbsp;all about 50,000, was extended on the line of the White&nbsp;Lorn from Pirgos to Eski Djuma. On August 22nd&nbsp;and 23rd there were engagements about Ayaslar, resulting in&nbsp;the retirement of the Russians. On August 30th he attacked&nbsp;at Karahassankoi and drove the Russians across the river. On&nbsp;September 3rd he crossed the White Lorn and again defeated&nbsp;them at Katzelevo, the enemy retiring behind the Banitcha&nbsp;Lorn. On September 12th Mehemet Ali continued his advance,&nbsp;but halted on the 14th for a week. He then made an attack on&nbsp;Cerkovna on the 21st, but was repulsed with a loss of 1600 men,&nbsp;and two days later retired his army behind the White Lorn.&nbsp;He had effected nothing. As will be seen later, the Russian&nbsp;operations against Plevna had not been in any way disturbed.&nbsp;The containing force under the Cesarevich had retired a certain&nbsp;distance, but it still held the main Turkish army. Mehemet Ali’s&nbsp;original plan had been to advance by Osman Bazar, effect a&nbsp;junction with Suleiman, and move on Timova. But Suleiman&nbsp;was averse to his plan and it was negatived at Constantinople,&nbsp;though if this plan had been carried out with vigour, the position&nbsp;of the Russians should have been critical. He then advanced&nbsp;on a front of 50 m. instead of moving concentrated, which is&nbsp;the explanation of his failure. It is true that’ he was much&nbsp;hampered by the state of his cavalry, which was exhausted, and&nbsp;consequently was without information, while the Russians were&nbsp;well served. Mehemet Ali now concentrated his force, but at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this juncture he was superseded by Suleiman Pasha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To return to Plevna. At this time the Russians were disposed in a semicircle round Plevna, their right or N. flank resting on Ribina and the S. flank resting on Bogot.&nbsp;On August 30th Osman had moved out with a column&nbsp;of all arms towards Pelishat. The following day he&nbsp;engaged the Russians. The Turks lost 300 killed and 1000&nbsp;wounded, and the Russian losses were about 1000. It is difficult&nbsp;to say what was the object of this sortie, which was of the&nbsp;nature of a reconnaissance in force. It achieved nothing. The&nbsp;Turks were not defeated, but retired again into Plevna the&nbsp;same evening. By the end of August the whole of the Rumanian&nbsp;army had crossed the Danube, and during the first days of&nbsp;September the first Russian reinforcements, consisting of the&nbsp;2nd and 3rd infantry divisions and the 3rd Rifle Brigade, had&nbsp;arrived and joined the forces round Plevna. Mehemet Ali’s&nbsp;advance and the assaults on the Shipka had been repulsed.&nbsp;The Russians could expect no further reinforcements before&nbsp;October, and it was therefore decided to make a third attempt&nbsp;to take Plevna, but first of all to occupy Lovcha. Skobelev&nbsp;had already made an unsuccessful attempt on August 6th,&nbsp;and General Prince Imeretinski, with a force of two infantry&nbsp;divisions and a brigade of Cossacks, in addition to&nbsp;Skobelev’s mixed brigade, was now entrusted with the&nbsp;task. The garrison under Rifaat Pasha amounted to 8 battalions, 6 guns and some Circassians. Fighting commenced&nbsp;on Sept. 1st and on the 3rd the Turks were driven out, most of&nbsp;the survivors finding their way to Plevna, and bringing 5 guns&nbsp;with them. The Russians lost 1500, the Turks 2500. On&nbsp;Sept. 2nd, Osman set out with a strong relieving column from&nbsp;Plevna, but on the 4th, hearing that the Russians had already&nbsp;occupied the town, he turned back and reached Plevna on the&nbsp;6th. On Sept. 5th, 8 battalions and 2 batteries reached&nbsp;Orkhanie, and Osman’s force, including the Lovcha troops,&nbsp;numbered about 30,000 men and 72 guns. The Russian forces,&nbsp;including the Rumanians, numbered about 90,000. Their&nbsp;plan was, after a long artillery bombardment, to attack the&nbsp;eastern front with the Rumanian forces, the south-eastern&nbsp;front with the IV. and IX. Corps and the southern front with&nbsp;Imerctinski’s command. The attacks were to be simultaneous.&nbsp;The cavalry divisions were to be kept in rear and close to the flank&nbsp;of the attacking infantry. During the night of Sept. 6th/7th&nbsp;the troops were moved into preparatory position, and batteries&nbsp;were constructed at 3000 to 5000 yds. from the outer works.&nbsp;The artillery bombardment was commenced at 6 a.m. on Sept.&nbsp;7th and continued till midday Sept. nth. So far the infantry&nbsp;had only been engaged on the south flank, where Skobelev had&nbsp;succeeded Imeretinski in the command. He had succeeded&nbsp;in advancing to within 2000 yds. of the southern Turkish&nbsp;redoubts and had entrenched himself. The orders for Sept, nth&nbsp;were for the infantry assaults to be delivered at 3 p.m. after a&nbsp;six hours’ cannonade. A dense fog interfered with the artillery&nbsp;bombardment. At the end of the day the Rumanians had taken&nbsp;No. 1 Grivitza redoubt, the attack on the S.E. front had been&nbsp;repulsed and Skobelev had established himself within 1000&nbsp;yds. of Plevna, having taken Kavanlik and Issa forts. On&nbsp;Sept. 12th the Turks retook these forts and drove Skobelev&nbsp;back. During the next two days the Russians continued to&nbsp;bombard the works, but no further attack was made. The&nbsp;Rumanians remained in possession of the Grivitza redoubt,&nbsp;defeating an attempt made by the Turks to retake it on Sept.&nbsp;14th. The Russians then decided to retire and entrenched themselves on a line with Verbitza-Radischevo, with their cavalry&nbsp;extending to the Vid on either flank. There was no question&nbsp;of pursuit; in the first and second battles the numbers had been&nbsp;about equal, but now the Russians were vastly superior and&nbsp;Osman would have been crushed by a powerful counter-attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In their third battle the Turks had lost 5000, while the Russian casualties amounted to close on 20,000. The Russian&nbsp;bombardment, lasting four days, had effected nothing. It had&nbsp;not caused 200 casualties. The object of the artillery is to&nbsp;cover the advance of the infantry, and the arms must work in&nbsp;combination. The defender docs not expose himself to the&nbsp;artillery fire unless compelled to do so by the approaching&nbsp;infantry. The Russians failed to realize this and practically&nbsp;wasted their ammunition. They had again failed to reconnoitre the position and attacked along the whole front instead&nbsp;of pressing home in strength at the decisive points. Their&nbsp;attacks were not even simultaneous, and Osman was able to&nbsp;shift his reserves from point to point. In addition to this, when&nbsp;the Russians retired one-third of their force had not been&nbsp;engaged. The defects in their plan of action are largely attributable to the fact that though control was nominally centred in&nbsp;one man, senior officers were present who interfered with his&nbsp;arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was now decided to complete the investment of Plevna, and Todleben, the defender of Sevastopol, was entrusted&nbsp;with supreme control of the operations. He arrived&nbsp;on the scene on Sept. 28th, but it was not till Oct. 24th&nbsp;that the investment was completed, and, meanwhile,&nbsp;on Sept. 24th and again on Oct. 8th, stong reinforcements arrived, raising the Turkish force under Osman to 84&nbsp;battalions, 25 squadrons and 96 guns, with an effective of&nbsp;48,000 men. Plevna had been re-victualled and the sick and&nbsp;wounded had been sent back to Orchanie. General Krilov, who&nbsp;had been operating west of the Vid, with 52 squadrons and&nbsp;30 horse artillery guns, had failed to prevent these movements,&nbsp;and was superseded by General Gurko on Oct. 8th.
