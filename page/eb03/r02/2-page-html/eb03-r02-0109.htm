<p><span class="font0">ſuaded him ſrom it ; and on that occaſion, diſcloſing to him his birth, awakened in his breaſt ſentiments worthy&nbsp;of his extraction. He reſolved, at all adventures, to attempt the delivering of his mother and grandfather from&nbsp;oppreſſion. With this view he aſſembled the country&nbsp;people, over whom he had aſſumed a kind of ſovereignty, and engaged them to come to the city on an appointed day, and enter it by different gates, provided&nbsp;with arms, which they were to conceal. While Romulus was thus diſpoſing every thing for the execution&nbsp;of his deſign, Numitor made the ſame diſeovery to Remus concerning his parents, and the oppreſſions they&nbsp;groaned under ; which ſo fired him, that he was ready&nbsp;to embark in any enterpriſe. But Numitor took care&nbsp;to moderate the tranſports of his grandſon, and only&nbsp;deſired him to acquaint his brother with what he had&nbsp;heard fιom him, and to ſend him to his houſe. Romulus ſoon came, and was followed by Fauſtulus, who&nbsp;took with'him the trough or ſkiſſ in which the twins had&nbsp;been expoſed, to ſhow it to Numitor : but, as the ſhep-herd betrayed an air of concern and earneſtneſs in his&nbsp;looks, he was flopped at the gate of the city, led before&nbsp;Amulius, and examined concerning his burden. It&nbsp;was eaſily known by its make and inſcription, which&nbsp;was ſtill legible ; and therefore Fauſtulus owned what it&nbsp;was, and conſeſſed that the twins were living ; but, in&nbsp;order to gain time, pretended that they were feeding&nbsp;flocks in a remote deſert. In the mean time, the&nbsp;uſurper’s death being reſolved on, Remus undertook to&nbsp;raiſe the city, and Romulus to inveſt the king’s palace.&nbsp;The country people came at the time appointed, and&nbsp;formed themſelves into companies each conſiſting of ιoo&nbsp;men. They had no other enſigns but bundles of hay&nbsp;hanging upon long poles, which the Latins at that time&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manipuli</span><span class="font0"> ; and hence came the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mαnipu∙&nbsp;lares,</span><span class="font0"> originally given to troops raiſed'in the country.&nbsp;With this tumultuous army Romulus beſet the avenues&nbsp;of the palace, forced the guard, and having killed the&nbsp;tyrant, after he had reigned 42 years, reſtored his&nbsp;grandfather Numitor to the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Affairs being thus ſettled at Alba, the two brothers, by the advice of Numitor, undertook the founding of a new colony. The king beſtowed on them thoſe lands near the Tiber where they had been&nbsp;brought up, ſupplied them with all manner of inſtruments for breaking up ground, with ſlaves, and beaſts&nbsp;of burden, and granted full liberty to his ſubjects to&nbsp;join them. Hereupon moſt of the Trojans, of whom&nbsp;there ſtill remained 50 families in Auguſtus’s time,&nbsp;choſe to follow the fortune of Romulus and Remus, as&nbsp;did alſo the inhabitants of Pallantium and Saturnia,&nbsp;two ſmall towns. For the more ſpeedy carrying on of&nbsp;the work, it was thought proper to divide thoſe who&nbsp;were to be employed in the building of the city into&nbsp;two companies, one under the command of Romulus,&nbsp;the other of Remus ; but this diviſion, which was deſigned purely with a view to the public welfare, and&nbsp;that the two parties might work by way of emulation,&nbsp;gave birth to two factions, and produced a jealouſy between the two brothers, which broke out when they&nbsp;came to chooſe a place for the building of their new&nbsp;city ; for Remus was for the Aventine, and Romulus&nbsp;for the Palatine mount. Upon which, the matter being referred to their grandfather, he adviſed the contending parties to have recourſe to the gods, and to&nbsp;put an end to the diſpute by augury, to which he </span><span class="font1">wa∙&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">himſelf greatly addicted. The day appointed for the&nbsp;ceremony being come, the brothers poſted themſelves&nbsp;each upon his hill ; and it was agreed, that whoever&nbsp;ſhould ſee the firſt flight, or the greateſt number, of&nbsp;vultures, ſhould gain his cauſe. After the two rival»&nbsp;had waited ſome time for the appearance of a favourable omen, Romulus, before any had appeared, ſent to&nbsp;acquaint his brother that he had ſeen ſome vultures ;&nbsp;but Remus, having actually ſeen ſix, while his brother’s&nbsp;meſſengers were yet on their way, haſtened, on their arrival, to mount Palatine, to examine the truth of what&nbsp;they had told him. He had no ſooner got thither, than&nbsp;by an unexpected good fortune twelve vultures appeared to Romulus. Theſe he immediately ſhowed to his&nbsp;brother ; and, tranſported with joy, deſired him to&nbsp;judge himſelf of the truth of what his meſſengers had&nbsp;told him. However, Remus diſcovered the deceit ;&nbsp;and, being told that Romulus had not ſeen the twelve&nbsp;vultures till after he had ſeen ſix, he inſiſted on the time&nbsp;of his ſeeing them, and the other on the number of&nbsp;birds he had ſeen. This widened the breach between&nbsp;the two brothers ; and, their parties being divided,&nbsp;while each man eſpouſed the cauſe of his leader, the&nbsp;diſpute grew ſo warm, that, ſrom words they came at&nbsp;length to blows. The ſhepherd Fauſtulus, who was&nbsp;equally dear to both the brothers, endeavouring to&nbsp;part the combatants, was by an unknown hand laid&nbsp;dead on the ſpot. Some writers tell us, that Remus&nbsp;likewiſe loſt his life in the fray ; but the greater number place his death later, and ſay that he was killed by&nbsp;one Fabius, for having, in dcriſion, leaped over the&nbsp;wall of the new city : but Livy ſays, the more common report was, that Remus ſell by the hand of his&nbsp;brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Romulus, being now head of the colony, by having got the better of his brother’s party in the late engagement, applied his thoughts wholly to the<sup>z</sup> building of&nbsp;the city, which he propoſed to call after his own name.&nbsp;He choſe mount Palatine for its ſituation, and performed all thoſe ceremonies which the ſuperſtition of the&nbsp;Hetrurians had introduced. He firſt offered ſacrifices&nbsp;to the gods, and ordered all the people to do the ſame :&nbsp;and from that time decreed, that eagles ſhould be the&nbsp;auſpices of his new colony. After this, great fires were&nbsp;kindled before their tents, and all the people leaped&nbsp;through the flames to purify themſelves. When this&nbsp;ceremony was over, they dug a trench round the ſpot&nbsp;where the aſſemblies of the people were afterwards&nbsp;held, and threw into it the firſt-ſruits of whatever they&nbsp;were allowed to make uſe of for food : every man of the&nbsp;colony was ordered to eaſt into the ſame trench an&nbsp;handful of earth, brought either from his own or ſome&nbsp;neighbouring country. The trench they called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mundus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">that is, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the world,</span><span class="font0"> and made it the centre round which&nbsp;the city was to be built. Then Romulus, yoking an&nbsp;ox and a cow to a plough, the coulter whereof was&nbsp;braſs, marked out, by a deep furrow, the whole compaſs&nbsp;of the city. Theſe two animals, the ſymbols of marriage, by which cities are peopled, were afterwards ſlain&nbsp;upon the altar. All the people followed the plough,&nbsp;throwing inwards the clod« of earth which the plough-ſhare ſometimes turned outwaιds. Wherever a gate&nbsp;was to be made, the plough was lifted up, and carried ;&nbsp;and hence came the Latin word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">porta, <sup>ti</sup> v.</span><span class="font0"> gate,” de-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
