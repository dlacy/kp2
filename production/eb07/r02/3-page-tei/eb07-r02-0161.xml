The Parthian dynasty was overturned, and the ancient Persian restored; and with its restoration was renewed its claims to the sovereignty of all Asia, which it had formerly possessed. This claim gave rise to a war against the Romans, and Alexander led his troops to the East to maintain their imperial sway over the disputed territories. In the army he displayed the high qualities of a warrior, and gained a great victory over the Persians, but was prevented from following up his success in consequence of a pestilence breaking out among his troops. The Persians, however, were willing to renounce hostilities for a time, and the emperor returned to Rome in triumph.</p><p>Scarcely had Alexander tasted repose from his Persian war, when he received intelligence that the Germans had crossed the Rhine, and were invading Gaul. He at once set out to oppose this new enemy, but he encountered another still more formidable. The armies in Gaul had sunk into a great relaxation of the rigid discipline necessary for even their own preservation. Alexander began to restore the ancient military rules, to enforce discipline, and to reorganise such an army as might be able to keep the barbarians in check. The demoralised soldiery could not endure the change. A conspiracy was formed against him, and the youthful emperor was murdered in his tent, in his twenty-ninth year, after a short but glorious reign of thirteen years.</p><p>The sceptre was now seized by the chief instigator ofthe mutiny, Caius Julius Maximinus, by birth a Thracian peasant. He was a man of gigantic stature and strength, indefatigable hardihood, and great personal daring; but to the wily cunning added the savage ferocity ofan ignorant barbarian. He began his reign by murdering all the friends of the late emperor, and sent orders to the senate to ratify his bloody deeds. Having thus, as he thought, fixed himself firmly on the throne, he prosecuted the war against the Germans with great success, routed them in several battles, and devastated an immense extent of the country, selling the inhabitants for slaves. He next marched against the Sarmatians and the Dacians, over whom he gained several victories ; and elated with success he was resolved to subdue their country, till he should reach the northern ocean. But an insurrection arose in Africa, caused by his insatiable avarice, and Gordian, proconsul of Africa, was proclaimed emperor. On receiving this intelligence, Maximinus quitted Sirmium and began his march towards Italy, resolved to glut his savage heart with vengeance. In the meantime, Gordian was defeated and slain by Maximinus’s lieutenant ; but the senate, knowing it in vain to expect mercy, chose as emperors, Balbinus and Pupienus, who, to gratify the people, gave the title of Cæsar to the youthful Gordian, a boy of twelve years old. Maximinus had by this time entered Italy, and laid siege to Aquileia. He met with a gallant resistance ; and his own troops suffering excessively during the siege, mutinied, and slew him while he lay asleep in his tent.</p><p>The death of Maximinus left the throne in the possession of the youthful Gordian, and prevented the horrors of a civil war. But the empire continued to be assailed by the restless hordes of barbarians, the Carpi, who had crossed the Danube, ravaging the province of Moesia, while the Persians were invading the eastern dominions. In this emergency, Gordian was ably supported by his father-in-law, Misitheus, præfect of the prætorian guards, who possessed at once the qualities of a statesman and a general. Sapor, the second prince of the new Persian dynasty, the Sassanides, had made some daring and successful inroads upon the Roman dominions ; but the emperor, aided by the skilful support of Misitheus, drove back the invaders, defeating them in every encounter, and penetrating to the very heart of their territories. These successes were dearly purchased by the death of the wise and brave Misitheus, to whom they are chiefly ascribed. Gordian appointed Philip the</p><p>Arabian to the station vacant by the death of Misitheus ; and prosecuted the war with undaunted courage and undiminished success. But Philip found means to raise in the army such a mutiny as could not be subdued, without his elevation to an equality with Gordian in the empire. This success in guilt stimulated Philip to additional crimes for the promotion ofhis lawless ambition, and he rested not till he procured the murder of this young emperor, who was giving such proofs of ability, and such promise of future excellence.</p><p>Philip, to secure his tenure of power, concluded a peace with the Persians, and hastened to Rome, where he endeavoured to persuade the senate that the death of Gordian was caused by disease. He did not long enjoy his sovereignty undisturbed. Insurrections of a formidable character broke out in different parts of the empire, especially in Pannonia. Trajanus Decius, whom Philip had sent to suppress this insurrection, had scarcely reached his army when he was compelled to assume the imperial diadem. Philip marched against his unwilling antagonist, but was defeated and slain near Verona. In the reign of Philip the secular games were celebrated, in what was computed to be the one thousandth year from the foundation of the city.</p><p>The reign of Trajanus Decius is memorable on two accounts. Its annals are stained by one of the most sanguinary persecutions that ever tried the sincerity and zeal ofthe Christian church. Almost innumerable multitudes of Christians were banished, imprisoned, or tortured to death with the most relentless cruelty. The revolution in Persia, which established the dynasty of the Sassanides, restored the worship and the tenets inculcated by the followers of Zoroaster ; and caused the retreat of the Asiatic Christians into the dominions ofthe Romans, at that time more tolerant. But these Asiatic Christians brought with them many ofthe notions peculiar to the East, and thus gave rise to dissensions among the Christians themselves. Decius, a man of stern and unaccommodating temper, determined to put an end to all such discussions, by completely suppressing Christianity itself ; and he published a bloody edict, prohibiting all innovations in religion, and strictly enjoining compliance with the ancient idolatrous worship of Greece and Rome. The horrors occasioned by this cruel edict could not be enumerated, and it is not our province to make the attempt. But it ought to be mentioned that the ascetic and mystic notions prevalent in the East, when driven to excess by this persecution, induced numbers to betake themselves to wild and desert solitudes to seek for safety ; and from this excessive development of the ascetic spirit at length arose the monastic, that fertile source of so many errors and abuses.</p><p>The other memorable event in the reign of Decius, is the first appearance of the Goths among the contending nations by whom the Roman empire now began to be regarded as a common enemy, or rather perhaps as a common prey. The origin of this mighty people is involved in deep obscurity, which the utmost researches of learned men have not been able entirely to remove. The most probable opinion, however, appears to be, that which regards them as a powerful branch of the great lndo-Teu-tonic race, by which both northern Asia and northern Europe were peopled, at some indefinitely remote period, before which the southern districts had already been inhabited, very probably by the Pelasgian race. After having been settled for ages in Scandinavia, they appear to have resolved on a southern migration, passed along the lower shore of the Baltic, followed the course of the Borysthenes, (Dnieper,) and the Tanais, (Don,) and took possession of the Ukraine. Thence they afterwards directed their course south-west, ravaged the province of Dacia, and crossing the Danube, appeared in great strength in Mœsia. When information respecting these new and formidable invaders was carried to Rome, Decius immediately marched against</p></body></text></TEI>
