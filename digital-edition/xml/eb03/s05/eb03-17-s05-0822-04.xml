In 1678 it was forced to ſurrender to the elector of Brandenburg, arter 1800 houſes had been burnt to aſhes in one night’s time. After this the Swedes defended it to the laſt extremity ; and Charles XII. in 1714, came hither after its return out of Turkey. But the crown of Sweden not being able to hold out againſt five great powers, it was forced to ſubmit in 1715. In 1720 it was rendered back to Sweden, but in a very poor condition.
