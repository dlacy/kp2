Together with <hi rend="italic">Honourable,</hi>  to the ſpeaker of the houſe of commons ; but to no other commoner excepting thoſe who are members of his majeſty’s moſt honourable privy-council ; and the three lord mayors of London, York, and Dublin, and the lord provoſt of Edinburgh, during their office. See Honourable and PR0v0sτ.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hereditary Right.</hi>  See HeREDitλry.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Right is a word which, in the propriety of the Engliſh language, is uſed ſometimes as an adjective and ſometimes as a ſubſtantive. As an adjective it is nearly of the ſame import with </hi><hi rend="italic">ft, ſuitable, becoming, proper ; </hi>and whilſt it expreſſes a quality, it indicates a relation*. Thus, when we ſay that an action is <hi rend="italic">right,</hi>  we muſt not only know the nature of the action, but, if we ſpeak intelligibly, muſt alſo perceive its relation to the end for which it was performed ; for an action may be <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  with one end in view which would be <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>  with another. The conduct of that general would be <hi rend="italic">right, </hi>who, to fave an army that could not be otherwiſe ſaved, ſhould place a ſmall detachment in a ſtation where he knew they would all be inevitably cut off ; but his conduct would be very <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>  were he to throw away the life of a ſingle individual for any purpoſe, however important, which he knew how<hi rend="sup">,</hi>  to accompliſh without ſuch a ſacrifice.</p><p>Many philoſophers have talked of actions being <hi rend="italic">right </hi>and <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>  in the abſtract without regard to their natural conſequences ; and converting the word into a ſubſtantive, they have fancied an eternal rule of <hi rend="italic">right, </hi>by which the morality of human conduct is in every particular caſe to be tried. But in theſe phraſes we can diſcover no meaning. Whatever is <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  muſt be ſo on <hi rend="italic">ſome account or other ;</hi>  and whatever is <hi rend="italic">ft,</hi>  muſt be fit for ſome <hi rend="italic">purpoſe.</hi>  When he who reſts the foundation of virtue on the <hi rend="italic">moralſenſe,</hi>  ſpeaks of an action being <hi rend="italic">right,</hi>  he muſt mean that it is ſuch as, through the medium of that ſenſe, will excite complacency in the mind of the agent, and gain to him the general approbation of mankind. When he who reſts moral obligation on the will of God, ſpeaks of ſome actions as <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  and of others as <hi rend="italic">wrong,</hi>  he muſt mean that the former are agreeable to the divine will, however made known to men, and the latter diſagreeable to it ; and the man who deduces the laws of virtue from what he calls the <hi rend="italic">ftneſs of things,</hi>  muſt have ſome <hi rend="italic">end in view,</hi>  for which things are fit, and denominate actions <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>  as they tend to promote or counteract that end.</p><p>But the word <hi rend="italic">right,</hi>  uſed as a fubſtantive, has in common as well as in philoſophical language a ſignification •which at firſt view appears to be very different from this. &lt;It denotes a <hi rend="italic">juſt claim</hi>  or an <hi rend="italic">honeſt poſſeſſon,</hi>  Thus we ſay, a father has a <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  to reverence from his children, a •huſhand to the love and fidelity of his wife, and a king to the allegiance of his ſubjects. But if we trace theſe <hi rend="italic">rights</hi>  to their ſource, we ſhall find that they are all laws of moral obligation, and that they are called <hi rend="italic">rights</hi>  only becauſe it is agreeable to the will of God, to the in-ſtinctive dictates of the moral ſenſe, or to the fitneſs of things, if ſuch a phraſe has any meaning, that children reverence their parents, that wives love their huſhands, and that ſubjects pay allegiance to their ſovereign. This will be apparent to any man who ſhall put to himſelf ſuch queſtions as theſe : “ <hi rend="italic">Why</hi>  have parents a <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  to Teverence from their children, huſhands to the love of</p><lb/><p>their wives, and ſovereigns to the allegiance of their ſubjects ?” As theſe queſtions contain in them nothing abſurd, it is obvious that they are each capable of a preciſe anſwer ; but it is impoſſible to give to any of them an anſwer which ſhall have any meaning, and not imply that <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  arid <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi>  are reciprocal, or, in other words, that wherever there is a <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  in <hi rend="italic">one perſon, </hi>there is a correſponding <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi>  upon <hi rend="italic">others.</hi>  Thus to the queſtion, “ Why have parents a right to reverence from their children ?” it may be anſwered, “ be-caule, under God, they were the authors of their childrens being, and protected them from danger, and fur-niſhed them with neceſſaries,. when they were in a ſtate ſo helpleſs that they could do nothing for themſelves.” This anſwer conveys no other meaning than that there is an obligation upon children, in return for benefits received, to reverence their parents. But what is the ſource of this obligation ? It can only be the will of God, the moral ſenſe, or the fitneſs of things.</p><p>This view of the nature of right will enable us to form a proper judgment of the aiſertionof a late writer, “ that man has no rights.” The arguments by which this apparent paradox is maintained, are not merely ingenious and plauſible ; they are abſolutely concluſive. But then our philofoρher, who never chooſes to travel in the beaten track, takes the word <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  in a ſenfe ve-ry different from that in which it has been uſed by all other men, andconſiders it as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">diſcretionary power,</hi>  “ By the word <hi rend="italic">right</hi>  (lays he) is underſtood a full and complete power of either doing a thing or omitting it, without the perſon’s becoming liable to ani-madverſion or cenſure from another ; that is, in other words, without lus incurring any degree of turpitude or guilt.” In this ſenſe of the word he affirms, and affirms truly, that a man has no rights, no diſcretionary power whatever, except in things of ſuch total indifference as, whether “ he ſhall fit on the right or on the left ſide of his fire, or dine on beef to day or tomorrow.”</p><p>A propoſition ſo evidently true as this ſtood not in need of argument to ſupport it ; but as his arguments are clearly expreſſed, and afford a complete confutation of ſome popular errors ſanctioned by the reſpectable phraſe <hi rend="italic">rights of man,</hi>  we ſhall give our readers an opportunity of ſtudying them in his own words.</p><p>“ Political ſociety is founded on the principles of morality and juſtice. It is impoſſible for intellectual beings to be brought into coalition and intercourſe without a certain mode of conduct, adapted to their nature and connection, immediately becoming a duty incumbent on the parties concerned. Men would never have aſſociated il they had not imagined that, in conſequence of that aſlbciation, they would mutually conduce to the advantage and happineſs of each other.</p><p>I his is the real purpoſe, the genuine bafιs, of their intercourſe ; and, as far as this purpoſe is anſwered, ſo far does ſociety anſwer the end of its inſtſtution. There is only one poſtulate more that is neceſſary to bring us to a concluſive mode of reaſoning upon this ſubject. Whatever is meant by the term <hi rend="italic">right,</hi>  there can neither be oppoſite rights, nor rights and duties hoſtile to each other. The rights of one man cannot claſh with or be deſtructive of the rights of another : for this, inſtead of rendering the ſubject an important branch of truth and morality as the advocates of the rights of man certain-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
