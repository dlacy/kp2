<p><span class="font1">dians </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">black mangles,</span><span class="font1"> on account of the brown duſky colour of the wood. The bark is very brown, ſmooth, pliant when green, and generally uſed in the weſt In-dia iſlands for tanning of leather. Below this bark lies&nbsp;a cuticle, or ſkin, which is lighter, thinner, and more&nbsp;tender. The wood is nearly of the ſame colour as the&nbsp;bark ; hard, pliant, and very heavy. It is frequently&nbsp;uſed for fuel, for which purpoſe it is ſaid to Be remark-ably proper: the fires which are made of this wood&nbsp;being both clearer, more ardent and durable than thoſe&nbsp;made of any other materials whatever.—The wood is&nbsp;compact; almoſt incorruptible ; never ſplinters ; is eaſily&nbsp;worked; and were it not for its enormous weight,&nbsp;would be commodiouſly employed in almoſt all kinds&nbsp;of work, as it poſſeſſes every property of good timber.&nbsp;To the roots and branclies of mangroves that are immerſed in the water, oyſters frequently attach themſelves ; ſo that wherever this curious plant is found&nbsp;growing on the ſea-ſhore, oyfter-fiſhing is very eaſy ;&nbsp;as in ſuch cafes theſe ſhell-fifh may be literally ſaid to&nbsp;be gathered upon trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The red mangle or mangrove grows on tlie ſea-ſhore, and at the mouth of large rivers ; but does not advance, like the former, into the water. It generally&nbsp;riſes to the height of 20 or 30 feet, with crooked,&nbsp;knotty branches, which proceed from all parts of the&nbsp;trunk. The balk is ſlender, of a brown colour, and,&nbsp;when young, is ſmooth, and adheres very cloſely to the&nbsp;wood ; but when old, appears quite cracked, and is&nbsp;eaſily detached from it. Under this bark is a ſkin as&nbsp;thick as parchment, red, and adhering cloſely to the&nbsp;wood, from which it cannot be detached till the tree&nbsp;is felled and dry. The wood is hard, compact, heavy,&nbsp;of a deep red, with a very fine grain. The pith or&nbsp;heart of the wood being cut into ſmall pieces, and&nbsp;boiled in water, imparts a very beautiful red to the li-quid, which communicates the ſame colour to wool&nbsp;and linen. The great weight and hardneſs of the wood&nbsp;prevents it from being generally uſed. From the fruit&nbsp;of this tree, which, when ripe, is of a violet colour, and&nbsp;reſembles ſome grapes in taſte, is prepared an agreeable&nbsp;liquor, much eſteemed by the inhabitants of the Caribbee&nbsp;iſſands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">white mangle, ſo termed from the colour of its wood, grow, like the two former, upon the banks of&nbsp;rivers, but is ſeldom found near the ſea. The bark is&nbsp;grey ; the wood, as we have ſaid, white, and when&nbsp;green, ſupple ; but dries as ſoon as cut down, and be-comes very light and brittle. This ſpecies is generally&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rope-mangrove,</span><span class="font1"> from the uſe to which the bark&nbsp;is applied by the inhabitants of the weſt Indies. This&nbsp;bark, which, by reaſon of the great abundance of ſap,&nbsp;is eaſily detached when green from the wood, is beaten&nbsp;or bruiſed betwixt two ſtones, until the hard and woody&nbsp;part is totally ſeparated from that which is ſoft and&nbsp;tender. This laſt, which is the true cortical ſubſtance,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is </span><span class="font1">twiſted into ropes of all ſizes, which are exceedingly&nbsp;ſtrong, and not apt to rot in the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODES, a celebrated iſland in the Archipelago, the largeſt and moſt eaſterly of the Cyclades, was&nbsp;known in ancient times by the names of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aſteria, 0-phiuſa, Æthrœa, Trinacria, Corymbia, Poeſſa, Atabyria,&nbsp;Marcia, Oloeſſa, Stadia Telchinis, Pelagia,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In later ages, the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodus,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodes,</span><span class="font1"> prevailed, from the Greek word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhodon,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">as is commonly ſup-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"></span><span class="font1">poſed, ſignifying a &quot; roſe the iſland abounding very&nbsp;much with theſe flowers. Others, however, give differ-ent etymologies, among which it is difficult to find one&nbsp;preferable to another. It is about 20 miles diſtant&nbsp;from the coaſts of Lycia and Caria, and about 120&nbsp;miles in compaſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several ancient authors aſſert, that Rhodes was formerly covered by the ſea, but gradually raiſed its head above the waves, aud became au iſland. Delos and&nbsp;Rhodes (ſays Pliny), iſlands which have long been *&nbsp;celebrated, ſprung at firſt from the ſea. The ſame fact&nbsp;is ſupported by ſuch a variety of other evidence as render it indubitable. Philo f aſcribes the event to the&nbsp;decreaſe of the waters of the ocean. If his conjecture&nbsp;be not without foundation, moſt of the iſles of the Archipelago, being lower than Rhodes, muſt have had a</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſimilar origin. But it is much more probable that the&nbsp;volcanic fires, which in the fourth year of the 135th O-lympiad, raiſed Theraſia and Thera, known at preſent by&nbsp;the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Santorin,</span><span class="font1"> from the depths of the ſea, and&nbsp;have in our days thrown out ſeveral ſmall iſſands adjacent, alſo produced in ſome ancient era Rhodes and&nbsp;Delos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The firſt inhabitants of Rhodes, according to Diodorus Siculus, were called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Telchinœ,</span><span class="font1"> who came originally from the iſland of Crete. Theſe, by their ſkill in aſtrology, perceiving that the iſland was ſoon to be&nbsp;drowned with water, left their habitations, and made&nbsp;room for the Heliades, or grandſons of Phœbus, who&nbsp;took poſſeſſion of the iſland after that god had cleared&nbsp;it from the water and mud with which it was over-whelmed. Theſe Heliades, it ſeems. excelled all other&nbsp;men in learning, and eſpecially in aſtrology ; invented&nbsp;navigation, &amp;c. In after ages, however, being infeſt-ed with great ſerpents which bred in the iſſand, they&nbsp;had recourſe to an oracle in Delos, which adviſed them&nbsp;to admit Phorbas, a Theſſalian, with his followers, into&nbsp;Rhodes. This was accordingly done ; and Phorbas&nbsp;having deſtroyed the ſerpents, was, after his death, honoured as a demigod. Afterwards a colony of Cretans&nbsp;ſettled in ſome part of the iſſand, and a little before&nbsp;the Trojan war, Tlepolinius the ſon of Hercules, who&nbsp;was made king of the whole iſland, and governed with&nbsp;great juſtice and moderation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the Trojan war, all the ancient inhabitants were driven out by the Dorians, who continued to be&nbsp;maſters of the iſland for many ages. The government&nbsp;was at firſt monarchical ; but a little before the expedition of Xerxes into Greece, a republican form of go-vernment was introduced ; during which the Rhodians&nbsp;applied themſelves to navigation, and became very&nbsp;powerful by ſea, planting ſeveral colonies in diſtant.&nbsp;countries. In the time of the Peloponneſian war, the&nbsp;republic of Rhodes was rent into two factions, one of&nbsp;which favoured the Athenians, and another the Spar-tans ; but at length the latter prevailing, democracy&nbsp;was aboliſhed, and an ariſtocracy introduced. About&nbsp;351 B. C. we ſind the Rhodians oppreſſed by Mauſo-lus king of Caria, and at laſt reduced by Artemiſia&nbsp;his widow. In this emergency, they applied to the&nbsp;Athenians ; by whoſe aſſiſtance, probably, they regained their liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this time to that of Alexander the Great, the Rhodians enjoyed an uninterrupted tranquillity. To&nbsp;him they voluntarily ſubmitted ; and were on that ac</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
