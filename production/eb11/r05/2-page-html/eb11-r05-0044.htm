<p><span class="font0">To obtain the latex, deep incisions are made near the base of the tree extending up the trunk. Small shallow cups are placed below the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">incisions to receive the milk, each cup being attached by sticking a piece of soft clay to the tree and pressing the cup against it.&nbsp;The latex, of which each tree yields only about 6 oz. in three&nbsp;days, has a strong ammoniacal odour, which rapidly disappears,&nbsp;and in consequence of the loss of ammonia the latex will not keep&nbsp;for longer than a day unchanged; hence when it has to be carried to&nbsp;a distance from the place of collection, 3 % of ammonia solution is&nbsp;added. The latex usually furnished about 30% of rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To obtain the rubber, the latex is usually treated in the following manner. A piece of wood about 3 ft. long, with a flattened end&nbsp;forming a kind of paddle, is dipped in the milk, or this is poured oyer&nbsp;it as evenly as possible. The milk is then carefully dried by turning&nbsp;the mould round and round in the smoke produced by burning&nbsp;wood mixed with certain oily palm nuts; those of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Attalea excelsa&amp;re&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">considered best, the smoke being confined, within certain limits&nbsp;by the narrowness of the neck of the pot in which the nuts are&nbsp;heated. The creosote and other products from the smoke no doubt&nbsp;act antiseptically and prevent to a large extent the subsequent&nbsp;putrefaction of the proteids retained by the coagulated rubber.&nbsp;Each layer of rubber is allowed to become firm before forming&nbsp;another; a practised hand can make 5 or 6 lb in an hour. In some&nbsp;districts a stout stick is substituted for the paddle, on which the&nbsp;rubber as it coagulates is wound cylindrically. The rubber thus&nbsp;prepared is the finest that can be obtained. The cakes when&nbsp;completed are, in order to remove them from the mould, slit open&nbsp;with a sharp knife, which is kept wet, and are hung up to dry. The&nbsp;flat rounded cakes of rubber made in this manner are known in the&nbsp;London market as “ biscuits. ” They retain about 15% of moisture.&nbsp;The scrapings from the tree, which contain fragments of wood, are&nbsp;mixed with the residues of the collecting pots and the refuse of the&nbsp;vessels employed, and are. made up into large rounded balls, which&nbsp;form the inferior commercial quality called “ negrohead, ” and often&nbsp;contain 25 or 35% of impurity. The yield of rubber varies, but&nbsp;it is stated on an average to be 10 lb of rubber per tree, and if carefully tapped one tree will yield this amount for many years in&nbsp;succession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plantations of Hevea brasiliensis.—Hevea brasiliensis</span><span class="font0"> was introduced to Ceylon and Singapore from seedlings raised at Kew from Brazilian seed, specially collected by Mr H. A. Wickham in S.&nbsp;America. The seedlings rapidly developed and in most places in&nbsp;which they were planted grew into large trees which furnished&nbsp;satisfactory latex when tapped in their sixth or seventh year. Ever&nbsp;since plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> have been made on an increasing scale in&nbsp;the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States and in Ceylon,&nbsp;and at the present time rubber plantations form the principal&nbsp;industry in these colonies. Successful plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> have&nbsp;also been established in Java, Sumatra and Borneo. Many of these&nbsp;plantations have not yet reached the productive stage—that is, the&nbsp;sixth or seventh year. A large number of plantations in British&nbsp;Malaya and Ceylon are now actively exporting increasing quantities&nbsp;of rubber. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> seedlings were also introduced into India, but did&nbsp;not apparently succeed except in Burma and S. India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be estimated that between one and two million acres of land in the different countries referred to have been already&nbsp;appropriated for rubber plantations. Plantations are also being&nbsp;formed in British, French and German possessions in W. Africa&nbsp;and in the Congo, also in the tropical portions of Australia. In&nbsp;certain districts of British W. Africa the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> which has been&nbsp;planted promises well, especially in the Gold Coast, where good&nbsp;yields of latex arc stated to have been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be useful to summarize here the experience w hich has been gained in the formation of plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> and in the production&nbsp;of rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis</span><span class="font0"> as a rule flourishes.to the greatest extent at low altitudes on rich'soil capable of retaining moisture. The nature&nbsp;of the soil appears, however, to be of secondary importance, provided&nbsp;that it is able to hold moisture and that climatic conditions of high&nbsp;and even temperature with considerable rainfall and absence of&nbsp;wind are satisfied. Although the tree is sensitive to such conditions,&nbsp;it appears to possess a certain capacity of adaptation which should&nbsp;be borne in mind. Generally a low altitude is desirable, but good&nbsp;results have been obtained in Ceylon in sheltered positions at&nbsp;elevations of 3000 ft. and over, although at higher altitudes the&nbsp;growth of these trees appears to be slower. In many plantations&nbsp;besides catch crops (cassava, sesame, ground-nuts, &amp;c.) other&nbsp;crops, such as tea,, coffee, cocoa and tobacco, are grown&nbsp;with rubber. It is improbable, except in the early stages of&nbsp;the rubber tree, that this procedure will succeed; the rubber will&nbsp;ultimately dominate the position to the detriment and ultimate&nbsp;extinction of the other crop, whilst the growth of the rubber tree&nbsp;will be retarded. A partial exception may perhaps be made in the&nbsp;case of cocoa, when the two plants are placed not too closely in&nbsp;about equal numbers. In these circumstances it appears that&nbsp;satisfactory results may be obtained from both crops, at any rate for&nbsp;a certain number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The experience of planters in general is in favour of the complete removal of weeds from a rubber plantation. This practice, which&nbsp;involves periodical weeding, adds considerably to the cost of&nbsp;maintaining plantations, and, although justified so far by results,&nbsp;possesses several other disadvantages. During the tropical rains&nbsp;the soil is liable,, to a greater or less extent, to denudation, which&nbsp;becomes very serious wdien the land slopes; and in any case, the soil&nbsp;is apt to.become impoverished by the loss of its soluble constituents.&nbsp;These disadvantages are at their maximum when the rubber trees&nbsp;are quite young. At a later stage the shade of the large trees&nbsp;compensates to a considerable extent for the absence pf cover on the&nbsp;ground. Another disadvantage of uncovered soil in a plantation of&nbsp;young rubber trees is that the ground under the heat of a tropical&nbsp;sun rapidly loses its moisture. For this reason proposals have been&nbsp;made to plant in the place of weeds low-growing leguminous plants,&nbsp;the growl h of which will not only prevent impoverishment and loss of&nbsp;soil during the rains and.conserve moisture in the heat, but will&nbsp;also have the effect of enriching the soil in nitrogenous constituents&nbsp;through the power leguminous plants possess of absorbing nitrogen&nbsp;from the air through nodules on their roots. Among the plants&nbsp;which are being tried for this purpose are various species of Crotolaria,&nbsp;passion-flower, and the well-known sensitive plant of the East.&nbsp;The success of the method cannot yet be judged, but the experiment&nbsp;is one wkich deserves, very full trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of. the most important subjects in connexion with rubber plantations is the&nbsp;method to be adopted&nbsp;in tapping the trees&nbsp;for latex. The native&nbsp;methods in vogue in&nbsp;Brazil and Mexico are&nbsp;primitive and often injurious to the tree. At&nbsp;present it cannot be&nbsp;said that finality has&nbsp;been reached on the&nbsp;subject of the best&nbsp;method, giving a good&nbsp;return of latex with a&nbsp;minimum of damage to&nbsp;the tree. A method&nbsp;at one time largely&nbsp;adopted was to make a&nbsp;series of V-shaged incisions on four sides of&nbsp;the tree to a height of&nbsp;about 6 ft. from the base&nbsp;—that is, within the&nbsp;reach of an ordinary&nbsp;man without the need&nbsp;for ladder or scaffolding; the latex obtained x.&nbsp;from the upper part&nbsp;of the. tree is said&nbsp;to furnish less rubber&nbsp;and of poor quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The latex is collected in cups placed at the apex of each V. Other systems are the herring-bone plan </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">a vertical channel</span></p>
