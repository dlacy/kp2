When Camilla was introduced a ſecond time, Sixtus embraced her tenderly, and said, “ Now we know indeed that it is our sister : nobody shall make a princeſs of you but ourſelves.” He ſtipulated with his ſiſter, that ſhe ſhould neither aſk any favour in matters of government, nor intercede for criminals, nor interfere in the adminiſtration of juſtice ; declaring that every requeſt of that kind would meet with a certain refuſal. Theſe terms being agreed to, and punctually obſerved, he made the moſt ample proviſion not only ſor Camilla but for his whole relations.</p><p>This great man was alſo an encourager of learning. He cauſed an Italian tranſlation of the Bible to be published, which raiſed a good deal of diſcontent among the Catholics. When ſome cardinals reproached him for his conduct in this reſpect, he replied, “ It was publiſhed for the benefit of you cardinals who cannot read Latin.”</p><p>Sixtus died in 1590, aſter having reigned little more than five years. His death was aſcribed to poiſon, ſaid to have been adminiſtered by the Spaniards ; but the story ſeems rather improbable.</p><p>It was to the indulgence of a diſpoſition naturally formed for ſeverity, that all the defects of this wonderful man are to be aſcribed. Clemency was a ſtranger to his boſom ; his puniſhments were often too cruel, and ſeemed ſometimes to border on revenge. Paſquin was dreſſed one morning in a very naſty ſhirt, and being aſked by Martorio why he wore ſuch dirty linen ? replied, that he could get no other, for the pope had made his waſherwoman a princeſs, alluding to Camilla, who had formerly been a laundreſs. The pope ordered ſtrict ſearch to be made for the author of this lampoon, and offered him his life and a thouſand piſtoles if he would discover himſelf. The author was ſimple enough to make his appearance and claim the reward. “ It is true (ſaid the pope) we made ſuch a promiſe, and we ſhall keep it ; your life ſhall be ſpared, and you ſhall receive the money preſently : but we have reſerved to ourſelves the power of cutting off your hands and boring your tongue through, to prevent your being ſo witty for the future.” It is needless to add, that the ſentence was immediately executed. This, however, is the only inſtance oſ his reſenting the many ſevere satires that were publiſhed againſt him.</p><p>But though the conduct of Sixtus ſeldom excites love, it generally commands our eſteem, and ſometimes our admiration. He ſtrenuouſly defended the cauſe of the poor, the widow, and the orphan : he never refuſed audience to the injured, however wretched or forlorn their appearance was. He never forgave thoſe magiſtrates who were capable of partiality or corruption ; nor buffered crimes to paſs unpuniſhed, whether committed by the rich or the poor. He was frugal, temperate, ſober, and never neglected to reward the ſmalleſt favour which had been conferred on him before his exaltation.</p><p>When he mounted the throne, the treaſury was not only exhauſted, but in debt ; at his death it contained five millions of gold.</p><p>Rome was indebted to him for ſeveral of her greateſt embelliſhments, particularly the Vatican library : it was by him, too, that trade was firſt introduced into the Eccleſiaſtical State.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SIYA-ghush,</hi> the caracal of Buffon, an animal of the cat kind.

To <hi rend="italic">ſize,</hi> in the language of the univerſity, is to <hi rend="italic">get </hi>any sort of victuals from the kitchens, which the ſtudents may want in their own rooms, or in addition to their commons in the hall, and for which they pay the cooks or butchers at the end of each quarter. A size of any thing is the ſmalleſt quantity of that thing which can be thus bought : two ſizes, or a part of beef, being nearly equal to what a young perſon will eat of that diſh to his dinner ; and a ſize of ale or beer being equal to half an Engliſh pint.</p><p>The ſizars are divided into two claſſes, viz. ſubſizatores or ſizars, and sizatores or proper ſizars. The former of theſe are ſupplied with commons from the table of the fellows and fellow-commoners ; and in former times, when theſe were more ſcanty than they are now, they were obliged to ſupply the deficiency by ſizing, as is ſometimes the case ſtill. The proper ſizars had formerly no commons at all, and were therefore obliged to ſize the whole. In St John’s college they have now ſome commons allowed them for dinner, from a benefaction, but they are ſtill obliged to ſize their ſuppers : in the other colleges they are allowed a part of the fellow-commons, but muſt ſize the rest ; and from being thus obliged to ſize the whole or part of their victuals, the whole order derived the name of siza<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi></p><p>In Oxford, the order ſimilar to that of ſizar is denominated <hi rend="italic">ſervitor,</hi> a name evidently derived from the menial duties which they perform. In both univerſities theſe orders were formerly diſtinguiſhed by round caps and gowns of different materials from thoſe of the penſioners or commoners, the order immediately above them. But about 30 years ago the round cap was entirely aboliſhed in both ſeminaries. There is ſtill, however, in Oxford, we believe, a diſtinction in the gowns, and there is alſo a trifling difference in ſome of the ſmall colleges in Cambridge ; but in the large colleges the dreſs of the penſioners and ſizars is entirely the ſame.</p><p>In Oxford, the ſervitors are ſtill obliged to wait at table on the fellows and gentlemen-commoners ; but much to the credit of the univerſity of Cambridge, this moſt degrading and diſgraceful cuſtom was entirely aboliſhed about 10 or 12 years ago, and of courſe the ſizars of Cambridge are now on a much more reſpectable footing than the ſervitors of Oxford.</p><p>The ſizars are not upon the foundation, and therefore while they continue ſizars are not capable of being elected fellows ; but they may at any time, if they</p></body></text></TEI>
