<p><span class="font0">Thus, let there be a river which, in the expanded courſe of 6ooo fathoms, has io elbows, each of which&nbsp;has 30<sup>0</sup> of rebound ; and let its mean velocity be 20&nbsp;inches in a ſecond. If we would learn its whole ſlope&nbsp;in this 6000 fathoms, we muſt firſt find (by the formula of uniform motion) the ſlope </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font0"> which will produce&nbsp;the velocity of 20 inches in a ſtraight river of this&nbsp;length, ſection, and mean depth.

PRACTICAL INFERENCES.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">H</span><span class="font0">AVING thus eſtabliſhed a theory of a moſt important part of hydraulics, which may be confided in as a juſt repreſentation of nature’s procedure, we ſhall apply it to the examination of the chief reſults&nbsp;of every thing which art has contrived for limiting the&nbsp;operations of nature, or modifying them ſo. as to luit&nbsp;our particular views. Trailing to the detail which we&nbsp;have given of the connecting principles, and the chief&nbsp;circumſtanceswhich co-operatein producing the oſtenſible&nbsp;effect ; and ſuppoſing that ſuch of our readers as are&nbsp;intereſted in this ſubject will not think it too much trouble to make the applications in the ſame detail ; we&nbsp;ſhall content ourſelves with merely pointing out the ſteps&nbsp;of the proceſs, and ſhowing their foundation in the&nbsp;theory itſelf : and frequently, in place of the direct ana-lyiis which the theory enables us to employ for the fo.-lution of the problems, we ſhall recommend a proceſs of&nbsp;approximation by trial and correction, ſufficiently accurate, and more within the reach of practical engineers.&nbsp;We are naturally led to conſider in order the following,&nbsp;articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. The effects of permanent additions of every kind&nbsp;to the waters of a river, and the moſt effectual methods of preventing or removing inundations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. The effects of weirs, bars, ſluices, and keeps of&nbsp;every kind, for railing the ſurface of a river ; and the&nbsp;ſimilar effects of bridges, piers, and every thing which&nbsp;contracts the ſection of the ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. The nature of canals ; how they differ from rivers&nbsp;in reſpect of origin, diſcharge, and regimen, and what&nbsp;conditions are neceſſary for their moſt perfect conſtruc-tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. Canals for draining land, and drafts or canals of&nbsp;derivation from the main ſtream.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of the effects of permanent additions to the waters of a river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">From what has been ſaid. already, it appears that to every kind of foil or bed there correſponds a certain velocity of current, too ſmall to hurt it by digging it&nbsp;up, and too great to allow the depoſition of the materials which it is carrying along. Suppofing this&nbsp;known for any particular ſituation, and the quantity of&nbsp;water which the channel muſt of neceſſity diſcharge,&nbsp;we may wiſh to learn the ſmalleſt ſlope which muſt be&nbsp;given to this ſtream» that the waters </span><span class="font3">may run </span><span class="font0">with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">required velocity. This ſuggeſts</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. I. Given the diſcharge D of a river, and </span><span class="font1">V </span><span class="font0">its velocity of regimen : required the ſmalleſt ſlope </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s,</span><span class="font0"> and·&nbsp;the dimenſions of its bed ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the Hope muſt be the ſmalleſt poſſible, the bed. muſt have the form which will give the greateſt mean&nbsp;depth J, and ſhould therefore be the trapezium formerly&nbsp;deſcribed; and iζs area and perimeter are the ſame with-thoſe of a rectangle whoſe breadth is twice its height&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font0"> Theſe circumſtances give us the equation — </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">~2h<sup>l</sup>^</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the area of the ſection is twice the ſquare of the height, and the diſcharge is the product of this area&nbsp;and the velocity. Therefore</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">equal 4/——o,l,and every thing being known in the ſecond member of this equation, we eaſily get the value of j by a few trials after the following manner.. Suppoſe&nbsp;that the ſecond member is equal to any number, ſuch as&nbsp;9. Firſt ſuppoſe that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vs</span><span class="font0"> is = 9, Then the hyperbolic-logarithm of 9-f-ι,δOr 0f ιc,6 is 2,36. Therefore&nbsp;we have √b—Lv<sup>z</sup>j-f∙ 1,6= 9—2,36,-664 ; whereas&nbsp;it ſhould have been,=.9. Therefore ſay 6,64 : 9.-9 :12,2&nbsp;nearly. Now ſuppoie that yT is = 12,2. Then L.&nbsp;12,2-∣- 1,6 = Li3,8, =2,625 nearly, and 12,2—262y&nbsp;is 9^575, whereas it ſhould be 9. Now we find that&nbsp;changing the value of </span><span class="font1">v<sup>z</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font0"> from 9 to 12,2 has changed the&nbsp;anſwer from 6,64 to 9,575, or a change of 3,2 in our afo&nbsp;ſumption has made a change of 2,935 *<sup>n t</sup>he anſwer, and&nbsp;has left an error of 0,575. Therefore ſay 2,935 10,575&nbsp;= 3,2: 0,62.8. Then, taking 0,628 from I 2,2, we&nbsp;have (for our next aſſumption or value of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vs</span><span class="font0"> )ιr,572.&nbsp;Now 11,572+1,6= 13,172, and L 13,172 is 2,5#&nbsp;nearly. Now try this laſt value 11,572—2,58 is 9,008,&nbsp;ſufficiently exact. Tins may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the&nbsp;trials by which we may avoid an intricate analyfis.</span></p>
