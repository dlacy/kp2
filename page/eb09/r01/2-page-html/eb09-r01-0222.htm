<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">presented by some of׳ the Amphibians, notably by the Frog </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alytes obstetricans,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> where the male winds the string of ova&nbsp;as laid round his body, sits in concealment until their</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">development is sufficiently advanced, and then takes to the water, or in the grotesque Surinam Toad (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipa suri-namensis),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> where the male places the ova one by one in&nbsp;hollows in the loose skin of the back of the female, where&nbsp;they accomplish their development. Reptiles rarely show&nbsp;any care beyond at most burying their ova, but in Birds&nbsp;the evolution of parental care (no doubt associated with&nbsp;the need of high temperature for development) approaches&nbsp;its highest and most general evolution. The case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is also too familiar to need any description; but&nbsp;there is evidently good ground for the idea (of late ably&nbsp;popularized by Miss Buckley) that the marked success of&nbsp;Birds and Mammals in the struggle for existence is to be&nbsp;attributed perhaps not less to their peculiar care of offspring&nbsp;than to any advance in organization. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Spermatozoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—In 1677 Leeuwenhoek’s attention was drawn by Hamm, one of his pupils, to the active moving constituents of the seminal fluid, and he described these as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">animalcula spermatica</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spermatozoa</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(nrepya</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, seed ; ¿¿¡W,&nbsp;animal). Although known to be of constant occurrence,&nbsp;they were long regarded as parasites, and classified as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Helmintlies</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Infusoria</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see also article “ Zoophytes,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, 8th ed.), even Yon Baer maintaining this view as late as 1835. Soon after this date&nbsp;R. Wagner demonstrated their constant presence in fertile&nbsp;males and their absence in infertile bastards. Von Siebold&nbsp;discovered them in many Vertebrates, while Kolliker&nbsp;recognized them as definite histological elements arising&nbsp;within the testes. The old name, however, has persisted&nbsp;despite various proposals to replace it (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spermatozoids,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Yon Siebold ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fila spermatica,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Kolliker). (.6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy and Physiology of Spermatozoa.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Without attempting completeness it is necessary to note a few of&nbsp;the best marked forms of spermatozoa. The familiar&nbsp;type, that of a small more or less ovoid “ head,” with&nbsp;delicate thread-like cilium or “tail,” is of the commonest&nbsp;occurrence throughout the animal kingdom ; it is seen with&nbsp;specific modifications in 1-4 and 12-16 in fig. 3. Much&nbsp;less differentiated forms, however, occur, especially among&nbsp;the Branchiate Arthropods, of which some exhibit almost&nbsp;amoeboid forms,as in the Daphnoid </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moina,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or in Crabs (7 in&nbsp;fig. 3); others are rigid, with radiating processes, as in the&nbsp;Lobster (8 in fig. 3). That of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is a small nucleated&nbsp;cell without tail or process, but bearing a cap of protoplasm;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this, like the lateral process in the spermatozoon of the Chaetopod </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cletci</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (4 in fig. 3), is not, as might at first appear,&nbsp;an additional or accessory portion, but a mere persistent</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">embryonic structure, as will be understood from the outline of the facts of development given below. In a large number the nucleus is more or less drawn out to form&nbsp;either a continuous rod or a series of fine granules, the&nbsp;protoplasm in such cases forming a delicate film with&nbsp;lateral fringes, which may also be produced on one or both&nbsp;ends into a filament. This form is seen in many Planarians&nbsp;(compare 9-11 in fig. 3). In the Newt the head is elongated, and the tail bears a vibratile membrane. In Man&nbsp;a middle piece separates the peculiarly shaped head from&nbsp;the tail, and this seems to end in a still finer filament (14&nbsp;in fig. 3). Miescher and others describe their minute structure with yet greater detail, distinguishing in the head a&nbsp;wall enclosing peculiarly differentiated contents, in the&nbsp;middle piece a similar structure, and even an axial filament in the tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The movements of spermatozoa have attracted considerable attention, their action being mechanically comparable to that of cilia, and being affected similarly by reagents.&nbsp;Their great activity and prolonged vitality are noteworthy ; thus not only do they remain in movement for&nbsp;many hours—indeed until the onset of putrefaction—after&nbsp;their ejaculation from the body, but in many of the higher&nbsp;animals they may remain active in the oviducal passages&nbsp;for weeks. In the Bat the spermatozoa lie in the uterus&nbsp;awaiting the ovum from autumn till spring; while a&nbsp;queen Bee may go on laying the fertilized eggs (from&nbsp;which workers arise) for swarm after swarm for three&nbsp;years after her first and only fertilization, without entirely&nbsp;exhausting the supply of active and mobile spermatozoa in&nbsp;the, receptaculum, and such cases forcibly suggest that the&nbsp;spermatozoon has not only a vast intrinsic store of energy,&nbsp;but must also absorb nutritive matter from the environing&nbsp;tissues or secretions, much in fact as would an Infusorian&nbsp;parasite. (6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The chemical analysis of spermatozoa, though as yet but rude, yields results of interest. Thus, not only is the&nbsp;proportion of solid matter to water extremely high, but&nbsp;the small quantity of ordinary albumens and the high&nbsp;percentage of ethereal extractives are to be noted, the&nbsp;whole composition being more analogous to that of brain&nbsp;and nerve than of any other tissues. In round numbers,&nbsp;nearly 50 per cent, of the Salmon milt is nuclein, more&nbsp;than 25 per cent, is protamin, 10 per cent, is a mixture of&nbsp;ordinary albumens, and less than 5 per cent, is fat; while&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1\</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> per cent, of lecithin, per cent, of cholesterin, with&nbsp;traces of other products of metabolism, make up the&nbsp;rest.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Development of Spermatozoa</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spermatogenesis</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">).—Probably no subject within the whole range of histology (at least if we&nbsp;except that of the structure of striped muscular tissue) presents so&nbsp;many difficulties, or has been the subject of more prolonged&nbsp;research and controversy; and it is thus essential to clearness to&nbsp;recapitulate the history of the inquiry in some detail.
