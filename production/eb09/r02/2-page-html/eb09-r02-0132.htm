<p><span class="font2">RIVAROL, Antoine de (1753-1801), was born at Bagnols in Languedoc on the 26th June 1753, and died&nbsp;at Berlin on the 13th April 1801. It seems to be&nbsp;undisputed that his father was an innkeeper, but no&nbsp;researches have thrown any certain light on the question&nbsp;of his origin ; later he assumed the title of Comte de&nbsp;Rivarol, and attributed himself to a noble family of Italian&nbsp;origin. His enemies declared that the family name was&nbsp;really Riverot, and that, whether Italian or not, it had&nbsp;nothing whatever to do with countship. It is certain that&nbsp;he bore several names, and that when he was among the&nbsp;foremost defenders of aristocracy his claim to share in it&nbsp;was by no means allowed by his associates. He was well&nbsp;educated, and is said to have been admitted by the bishop&nbsp;of Uzès to a theological seminary, then to have held a&nbsp;tutorship at Lyons under the name of Longchamps, then&nbsp;to have appeared in Paris under the further travesty of&nbsp;Chevalier de Parcieux with no better reason than that his&nbsp;mother was related to a man of science of that name. All&nbsp;this, however, is of very little consequence ; it is sufficient&nbsp;that he appeared in Paris in 1780 (just when the operation&nbsp;of liberal ideas was throwing society most freely open to&nbsp;men of letters), with youth, good address, fair knowledge,&nbsp;and a very unusual stock of wit and literary ability. After&nbsp;competing for and sometimes winning several of the academic prizes then in greatest vogue, Rivarol distinguished&nbsp;himself in the year 1784 by a treatise </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sur Vuniversalité de&nbsp;la langue Française</span><span class="font2"> (which shows, if not much learning, the&nbsp;utmost critical acumen and a very happy faculty of expression), and by a translation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno,</span><span class="font2"> very free but of&nbsp;no small merit. The year before the Revolution broke out&nbsp;he, with some assistance from a man of similar but lesser&nbsp;talent, Champcenetz, compiled a lampoon entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petit&nbsp;Almanach de nos grands Hommes pour 1788,</span><span class="font2"> in which some&nbsp;writers of actual or future talent and a great many nobodies&nbsp;were ridiculed in the most pitiless manner. It made him&nbsp;many enemies, but scarcely more than his speeches in&nbsp;society had made. When the Revolution developed the&nbsp;importance of the press, Rivarol at once took up arms on&nbsp;the royalist side. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal Politique</span><span class="font2"> of Sabatier de&nbsp;Castres and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Actes des Apotres</span><span class="font2"> of Peltier were the chief&nbsp;papers in which he wrote. But he emigrated early in&nbsp;June 1792, and established himself at Brussels, whence he&nbsp;removed successively to London, Hamburg, and Berlin.&nbsp;For ten years he occupied himself not too strenuously with&nbsp;political pamphlets and literary projects, receiving pensions&nbsp;for his services to the royalist cause. He had married an&nbsp;Englishwoman, but had quarrelled with her, and during&nbsp;his later years had for his companion a pretty but totally&nbsp;uneducated girl named Manette, to whom he addressed&nbsp;certain often-quoted verses which are nearly poetry.&nbsp;RivaroΓs genius, however, was essentially a genius of prose,&nbsp;though not a prosaic genius. No single work of his of&nbsp;any length has very great merit, and he is accordingly only&nbsp;known to posterity by volumes of “ beauties ” and selections, composed of epigrammatic remarks, short passages of&nbsp;criticism, and the like. Rivarol could not tell an anecdote&nbsp;with quite the point of his contemporary and rival Cham-fort; but he has had no rival in France except Piron, and&nbsp;none in England except Sydney Smith, in sharp isolated&nbsp;conversational sayings. These were mostly ill-natured, and&nbsp;in some cases the full appreciation of them demands a more&nbsp;considerable acquaintance with the facts and men of the&nbsp;time than most readers possess. The brilliancy of RivaroΓs&nbsp;phrase, however, can escape no one. Burke was hyperbolical, and not altogether happily hyperbolical, in calling him&nbsp;the Tacitus of the Revolution, because the description suggests a power of historical portrait painting which Rivarol&nbsp;did not possess. But the expression no doubt really referred to the detached phrases which are so striking in&nbsp;Tacitus, and which Rivarol did in truth sometimes equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The works of Rivarol were published in five volumes by his friend Chênedollé (who has reported much remarkable conversation of his&nbsp;in his last days) and Fayolle (Paris, 1805) ; but their perusal as a&nbsp;whole can only be recommended to the student of literature.&nbsp;Selections are frequent: that published by De la Hays (Pans, 1858),&nbsp;with introductory matter by Sainte-Beuve and others, and that&nbsp;edited in 1862 by M. de Lescure, may be specified. The last-named editor published, in 1883, a study on Rivarol et la Société&nbsp;Française, which is the fullest treatment of the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIVE DE GIER, a town of France, in the department of Loire, situated 13 miles to the east-north-east of St&nbsp;Étienne, on the Lyons Railway at the head of the canal&nbsp;of Givors on the Gier. The town, which is constantly&nbsp;enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke, and presents a dirty&nbsp;and unattractive appearance, is principally dependent on the&nbsp;coal industry, there being fifty pits in the basin of the Gier,&nbsp;with an annual output of over 19,000,000 bushels. There&nbsp;are twenty-two coke and lamp black furnaces, and five glass&nbsp;works, the products of which—coloured glass and so-called&nbsp;Nuremberg mirrors—are celebrated, on account of the&nbsp;fineness and purity of the sand found on the banks of the&nbsp;Rhone and the Saône. Mining machinery, railway plant,&nbsp;and coarse ironmongery are also manufactured, and there&nbsp;are iron and steel works. A large number of persons are&nbsp;also employed in winding and spinning silk and in tapeweaving. The population in 1881 was 15,760.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rive de Gier is a place of some antiquity, as appears from remains of Gallo-Roman buildings, and mosaics and coins found at various&nbsp;times. In the 11th century the canons of Lyons were its superiors.&nbsp;At a later period the town was surrounded by a wall and protected&nbsp;by a fortress, of which, however, but few traces are visible. In the&nbsp;time of Henry IV. the working of the mines had already given to&nbsp;the locality a measure of importance which has steadily increased.&nbsp;At one time it was feared that the coal basin, which was considered&nbsp;distinct from that of St Étienne, would soon be exhausted, but&nbsp;it has now been proved that the two are in reality one, and that&nbsp;they have a long future before them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIVER ENGINEERING. The improvement of rivers may be considered under two aspects, for rivers form the&nbsp;natural channels for conveying the surplus rainfall from the&nbsp;districts through which they pass to the sea, and they can&nbsp;also be utilized for the purposes of inland navigation. If&nbsp;a river, owing to the small section of its channel, or the&nbsp;slight inclination of its bed, is incapable of discharging the&nbsp;whole volume of water which drains into it in rainy seasons,&nbsp;the lands along its banks become flooded, frequently to the&nbsp;great detriment of the crops, and sometimes with disastrous&nbsp;results to life and property. If, on the other hand, a river&nbsp;is impeded by rapids, by shoals, or by a bar at its mouth,&nbsp;it is prevented from serving as a natural highway for the&nbsp;traffic of the district through which it flows. Accordingly&nbsp;the mitigation of floods and the regulation of rivers are&nbsp;the problems which have ‘to be grappled with in the&nbsp;engineering of rivers. The first aims at remedying an&nbsp;existing evil, and the second deals with the development&nbsp;of the resources and trade of a country by the improvement of its water communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Floods.—</span><span class="font2">Floods are of two&quot; kinds, according to the nature of the country traversed by the rivers producing them. Torrential rivers, flowing over impermeable strata and having&nbsp;a rapid fall, rise rapidly after a heavy rainfall, and produce&nbsp;a high flood which quickly subsides. Gently flowing&nbsp;rivers on the contrary rise slowly, and do not attain the&nbsp;same height as torrential rivers ; but their floods subside&nbsp;slowly, and consequently, though less high, remain longer</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
