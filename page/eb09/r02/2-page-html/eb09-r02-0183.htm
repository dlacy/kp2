<p><span class="font1">much the best of his meditative poems, as elegant and finished in diction as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memory,</span><span class="font1"> and much more incisive&nbsp;in thought and touching in sentiment. His last, longest,&nbsp;and most interesting published work was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italy,</span><span class="font1"> the first&nbsp;instalment of which was published in 1821 and the last&nbsp;in 1834. It is said that, when the publisher complained&nbsp;that the public would not buy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italy,</span><span class="font1"> Rogers affirmed that&nbsp;lie “would make them buy it” ; and, calling in the aid of&nbsp;Turner and Stothard, he produced the sumptuous illustrated edition at a cost of £15,000. Apart from these&nbsp;adventitious charms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italy</span><span class="font1"> has much greater general interest&nbsp;than any other of Rogers’s poems, and is likely to be read&nbsp;for long, if only as a traveller’s companion. The style is&nbsp;studiously simple; the blank verse has quite an Elizabethan flavour, and abounds in happy lines ; the reflexions&nbsp;have a keen point ; and the incidental stories are told with&nbsp;admirable brevity and effect. Passages of prose are interspersed, wrought with the same care as the verses, and&nbsp;the notes are models of interesting detail concisely put.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the last five years of his life Rogers, who had been extremely active till his eighty-eighth year, was confined to&nbsp;his chair in consequence of a fall in the street. He died&nbsp;in London on 18th December 1855, in his ninety-third&nbsp;year. Only very fragmentary records are preserved of the&nbsp;brilliant gatherings at breakfast and dinner in his house.&nbsp;Fragments are to be gleaned in the diaries of Byron, Moore,&nbsp;Sydney Smith, and others. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections</span><span class="font1"> of his table-talk&nbsp;were published in 1856, and a volume of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of celebrities in 1857. A complete </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> is understood&nbsp;(1885) to be in preparation, with Mr P. W. Clayden as&nbsp;editor. Mr Hayward’s essay is the most complete account&nbsp;of Rogers hitherto published.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(w. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROHAN, Henri de (1579-1638), a general and writer of eminence and one of the last and best representatives&nbsp;of the independent French noblesse, was born at the&nbsp;château of Bleins in Brittany on 21st August 1579. His&nbsp;father was René IL, count of Rohan, and head of a family&nbsp;which had hardly a superior in France for antiquity and&nbsp;distinction, and which was connected with most of the&nbsp;reigning houses of Europe. Rohan was by birth the&nbsp;second son, but his elder brother René dying young he&nbsp;became the heir of the name. He appeared at court and in&nbsp;the army at the age of sixteen, and was a special favourite&nbsp;with Henry IV., after whom, failing the house of Condé,&nbsp;he ∙ might be said to be the natural chief of the French&nbsp;Protestants. Having served till the peace of Vervins, he&nbsp;travelled for a considerable time over Europe, including&nbsp;England and Scotland, in the first of which countries he received the not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth&nbsp;her knight, while in the second he was godfather at Charles&nbsp;I.’s christening. On his return to France he was made&nbsp;duke and peer at the age of twenty-four and married&nbsp;Marguerite de Béthune, Sully’s daughter, receiving lucrative appointments. After the assassination of Henry IV.,&nbsp;which was a great blow to him, Rohan fought with success&nbsp;at the siege of Jülich. But from this time onwards he&nbsp;was for the greater part of many years either in active&nbsp;warfare against the Government of his country, or in active&nbsp;though peaceable opposition to it. For a time, however,&nbsp;he abstained from actual insurrection, and he endeavoured&nbsp;to keep on terms with Marie de’ Medici ; he even, despite&nbsp;his dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII., reappeared in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont.&nbsp;It was not till the decree for the restitution of church&nbsp;property in the south threw the Bearnese and Gascons&nbsp;into open revolt that Rohan appeared as a rebel. His&nbsp;authority and military skill were very formidable to the&nbsp;royalists, forced them among other checks to raise the&nbsp;siege of Montauban, and brought about the treaty of&nbsp;Montpellier (1623). But Rohan did not escape the results of the incurable factiousness which showed itself&nbsp;more strongly perhaps among the French Huguenots than&nbsp;among any other of the numerous armed oppositions of&nbsp;the 17th century. He was accused of lukewarmness and&nbsp;treachery, though he did not hesitate to renew the war&nbsp;when the compact of Montpellier was broken. Again a&nbsp;hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted hardly any&nbsp;time, and Rohan undertook a third war, the first the events&nbsp;of which are recounted in his celebrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs.</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;last war (famous for the siege of La Rochelle, in which,&nbsp;however, Rohan’s brother Soubise, not Rohan himself, was&nbsp;principally concerned) was one of considerable danger for&nbsp;Rohan : he was condemned to death, and a great reward&nbsp;was offered for him dead or alive. Nor at the close of the&nbsp;war did he think it best to remain in France, but made&nbsp;his way to Venice. Here he lived quietly for some time&nbsp;and is said to have received from the Porte the offer of&nbsp;the sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his&nbsp;hosts of Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief,&nbsp;a design not executed owing to the peace of Cherasco&nbsp;(1631). Soon afterwards Rohan was again called to serve&nbsp;his lawful sovereign. Richelieu had had experience, though&nbsp;not friendly experience, of his abilities, and when France&nbsp;began once more to take a vigorous part in the Thirty Years’&nbsp;War Rohan was appointed to the task of occupying the&nbsp;Valtelline, and thus cutting off the communication between&nbsp;Germany and Italy. He was entirely successful and repeatedly beat both the imperialists and the Spaniards.&nbsp;But, despite this service, Rohan was still thought dangerous&nbsp;to the peace of France owing to his influence with the&nbsp;Huguenots, and objection was even made to his residence&nbsp;in Geneva. He therefore joined Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar,&nbsp;and was serving in his army when he met with the wound&nbsp;which caused his death at Rheinfelden on l4th March&nbsp;1638. His body was buried at Geneva and his arms&nbsp;solemnly bequeathed to and accepted by the Venetian republic. Rohan’s wife was a woman of talent and energy,&nbsp;though she did not escape scandal. His younger brother&nbsp;Benjamin, generally known as Soubise, was, like him, a&nbsp;famous Huguenot leader. His daughter and only recognized surviving child, named Marguerite, carried the&nbsp;honours of Rohan into the Chabot family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What has chiefly preserved Rohan’s memory is not his military achievements, though they were remarkable, nor his political position, though it was high, but his admirable J/eznoirs. These cover&nbsp;the civil wars in three books, while a fourth contains the narrative&nbsp;of the Valtelline campaigns ; and they rank among the best products&nbsp;of the singular talent for memoir-writing which the French aristocracy of the 16th and 17th centuries possessed. Alike in style, in&nbsp;clearness of matter, and in shrewdness of thought they deserve very&nbsp;high praise. The first three books appeared in 1644, that on the&nbsp;Valtelline War not till 1758. Some suspicions were thrown on the&nbsp;genuineness of this latter, but it would seem groundlessly. Rohan&nbsp;also wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Parfait Capitaine,</span><span class="font0"> an adaptation of the military precepts and examples of Cæsar to modern warfare ; an account of his&nbsp;travels ; a political tract, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L'Intérêt des États et des Princes de la&nbsp;Chrétienté,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs,</span><span class="font0"> which alone have continued to bo&nbsp;reprinted, may be conveniently found in the collection of Michaud&nbsp;and Poujoulat, voL xix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROHAN, Louis René Édouard, Cardinal de (1734-1803), prince de Rolian-Guéménée, archbishop of Strasburg, the hero of the scandal of the diamond necklace, and a cadet of the great family of Rohan (which traced&nbsp;its origin to the kings of Brittany, and was granted the&nbsp;precedence and rank of a foreign princely family by&nbsp;Louis XIV.), was born at Paris on 25th September 1734.&nbsp;Members of the Rohan family had filled the office of archbishop of Strasburg from 1704,—an office which made&nbsp;them princes of the empire and the compeers rather of&nbsp;the German prince-bishops than of the French ecclesiastics.&nbsp;For this high office Louis de Rohan was destined from&nbsp;his birth, and soon after taking orders, in 1760, he was&nbsp;nominated coadjutor to his uncle, Constantine de Rohan-</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
