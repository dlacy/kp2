Within recent years it has increased with great rapidity owing to the production of coal and iron, and in 1865 it was formed into a market town under a local board of health. It possesses a town-hall, a mechanicsâ€™ institute and reading room, and two market halls. A school board was formed in 1875. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 176 acres) in 1871 was 4627, and in 1881 it was 5917.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
