<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">sooner has it lain down than suddenly it jumps up in an agitated manner, walks backwards and forwards several times, again lies&nbsp;down and assumes a sleeping attitude, but has only maintained&nbsp;it for a few minutes when it is once more moving about. Again it&nbsp;retires to its corner, to the farthest recess it can find, and huddles&nbsp;itself up into a heap, with its head concealed beneath its chest and&nbsp;fore-paws. This state of continual agitation and inquietude is in&nbsp;striking contrast with its ordinary habits, and should therefore&nbsp;receive attention. Not unfrequently there are a few moments when&nbsp;the creature appears more lively than usual, and displays an extraordinary amount of affection. Sometimes there is a disposition to&nbsp;gather up straw, thread, bits of wood, &amp;c., which are industriously&nbsp;carried away ; a tendency to lick anything cold, as iron, stones,&nbsp;&amp;c., is also observed in many instances ; and there is also a desire&nbsp;evinced to lick other animals. Sexual excitement is also frequently&nbsp;an early symptom. At this period no disposition to bite is observed ;&nbsp;the animal is docile with its master and obeys his voice, though&nbsp;not so readily as before, nor with the same pleased countenance.&nbsp;There is something strange in the expression of its face, and the&nbsp;voice of its owner is scarcely able to make it change from a sudden&nbsp;gloominess to its usual animated aspect. These symptoms gradually become more marked : the restlessness and agitation increase.&nbsp;If on straw the dog scatters and pulls it about with its paws,&nbsp;and if in a room it scratches and tumbles the cushions or rugs on&nbsp;which it usually lies. It is incessantly on the move, rambling&nbsp;about, scratching the ground, sniffing in comers and at the doors,&nbsp;as if on the scent or seeking for something. It indulges in strange&nbsp;movements, as if affected by some mental influences, or a prey&nbsp;to hallucinations. When not excited by any external influence&nbsp;it will remain for a brief period perfectly still and attentive, as if&nbsp;watching something, or following the movements of some creature&nbsp;on the wall; then it will suddenly dart forward and snap at the&nbsp;vacant air, as if pursuing an annoying object, or endeavouring to&nbsp;seize a fly. At another time it throws itself, yelling and furious,&nbsp;against the wall, as if it heard threatening voices on the other&nbsp;side, or was bent on attacking an enemy. Nevertheless, the animal&nbsp;is still docile and submissive, for its master’s voice will bring it&nbsp;out of its frenzy. But the saliva is already virulent, and the excessive affection which it evinces at intervals, by licking the hands or&nbsp;face of those it loves, renders the danger very great should there&nbsp;be a wound or abrasion. Until a late period in the disease the&nbsp;master’s voice has a powerful influence over the animal. When&nbsp;it has escaped from all control and wanders erratically abroad,&nbsp;ferocious and restless, and haunted by horrid phantoms, the familiar&nbsp;voice yet exerts its influence, and it is rare indeed that it attacks&nbsp;its master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no dread of water in the rabid dog ; the animal is generally thirsty, and if water be offered will lap it with avidity, and swallow it at the commencement of the disease. And, when, at&nbsp;a later period, the constriction about the throat—symptomatic of&nbsp;the disease—renders swallowing difficult, the dog will none the&nbsp;less endeavour to drink, and the lappings are as frequent and prolonged when deglutition becomes impossible. So little dread has&nbsp;the rabid dog of water that it will ford streams and swim rivers ;&nbsp;and when in the ferocious stage it will even do this in order to&nbsp;attack other creatures on the opposite side. The evidence on this&nbsp;head is overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">At the commencement of the disease the dog does not usually refuse to eat, and some animals are voracious to an unusual degree.&nbsp;But in a short time it becomes fastidious, only eating what it&nbsp;usually has a special predilection for. Soon, however, this gives&nbsp;place to a most characteristic symptom—either the taste becomes&nbsp;extremely depraved or the dog has a fatal and imperious desire to&nbsp;bite and ingest everything. The litter of its kennel, wool from&nbsp;cushions, carpets, stockings, slippers, wood, grass, earth, stones,&nbsp;glass, horse-dung, even its own feces and urine, or whatever else&nbsp;may come in its way, are devoured. On examination of the body&nbsp;of a dog which has died of rabies it is so common to find in the&nbsp;stomach a quantity of dissimilar and strange matters on which&nbsp;the teeth have been exercised that, if there was nothing known&nbsp;of the animal’s history, there would be strong evidence of its&nbsp;having been affected with the disease. When a dog, then, is&nbsp;observed to gnaw and eat suchlike matters, though it exhibits no&nbsp;tendency to bite, it should be suspected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The mad dog does not usually foam at the mouth to any great extent at first. The mucus of the mouth is not much increased in&nbsp;quantity, but it soon becomes thicker, viscid, and glutinous, and&nbsp;adheres to the angles of the mouth, fauces, and teeth. It is at&nbsp;this period that the thirst is most ardent, and the dog sometimes&nbsp;furiously attempts to detach the saliva with its paws; and, if after&nbsp;a while it loses its balance in these attempts and tumbles over,&nbsp;there can no longer be any doubt as to the nature of the malady.&nbsp;There is another symptom connected with the mouth in that form&nbsp;of the disease named “dumb madness” which has frequently&nbsp;proved deceptive. The lower jaw drops in consequence of paralysis&nbsp;of its muscles, and the mouth remains open. The interior is diy&nbsp;from the air passing continually over it, and assumes a deep red</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tint, somewhat masked by patches of dust or earth, which more especially adhere to the upper surface of the tongue and to the&nbsp;lips. The strange alteration produced in the dog’s physiognomy&nbsp;by its constantly open mouth and the dark colour of the interior&nbsp;is rendered still more characteristic by the dull, sad, or dead expression of the animal’s eyes. In this condition the creature is not&nbsp;very dangerous, because generally it could not bite if it tried,—&nbsp;indeed there does not appear to be much desire to bite in dumb&nbsp;madness; but the saliva is none the less virulent, and accidental&nbsp;inoculations with it, through imprudent handling, will prove as&nbsp;fatal as in the furious form. The mouth should not be touched,&nbsp;—numerous deaths having occurred through people thinking the&nbsp;dog had some foreign substance lodged in its throat, and thrusting&nbsp;their fingers down to remove it. The sensation of tightness which&nbsp;seems to exist at the throat causes the dog to act as if a bone were&nbsp;fixed between its teeth or towards the back of its mouth, and to&nbsp;employ its fore-pgws as if to dislodge it. This is a very deceptive&nbsp;symptom, and may prove equally dangerous if caution be not observed. Vomiting of blood or a chocolate-coloured fluid is witnessed&nbsp;in some cases, and has been supposed to be due to the foreign substances in the stomach, which abrade the lining membrane ; this,&nbsp;however, is not correct, as it has been observed in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The voice of the rabid dog is very peculiar, and so characteristic that to those acquainted with it nothing more is needed to prove&nbsp;the presence of the disease. Those who have heard it once or twice&nbsp;never forget its signification. Owing to the alterations taking place&nbsp;in the larynx the voice becomes hoarse, cracked, and stridulous, like&nbsp;that of a child affected with croup,—the “voix du coq,”as the French&nbsp;have it. A preliminary bark is made in a somewhat elevated tone&nbsp;and with open mouth ; this is immediately succeeded by five, six,&nbsp;or eight decreasing howls, emitted when the animal is sitting or&nbsp;standing, and always with the nose elevated, which seem to come&nbsp;from the depths of the throat, the jaws not coming together and&nbsp;closing the mouth during such emission, as in the healthy bark.&nbsp;This alteration in the voice is frequently the first observable indication of the malady, and should at once attract attention. In dumb&nbsp;madness the voice is frequently lost from the very commencement,&nbsp;—hence the designation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The sensibility of the mad dog appears to be considerably diminished, and the animal appears to have lost the faculty of expressing the sensations it experiences: it is mute under the infliction of&nbsp;pain, though there can be no doubt that it still has peripheral&nbsp;sensation to some extent. Burning, beating, and wounding produce&nbsp;much less effect than in health, and the animal will even mutilate&nbsp;itself with its teeth. Suspicion, therefore, should always strongly&nbsp;attach to a dog which does not manifest a certain susceptibility to&nbsp;painful impressions and receives punishment without any cry or&nbsp;complaint. There is also reason for apprehension when a dog bites&nbsp;itself persistently in any part of its body. A rabid dog is usually&nbsp;stirred to fury at the sight of one of its own species ; this test has&nbsp;been resorted to by Bouley to dissipate doubts as to the existence&nbsp;of the disease when the diagnosis is othenvise uncertain. As soon&nbsp;as the suspected animal, if it is really rabid, finds itself in the&nbsp;presence of another of its species it at once assumes the aggressive, and, if allowed, will bite furiously. All rabid animals indeed&nbsp;become excited, exasperated, and furious at the sight of a dog, and&nbsp;attack it with their natural weapons, even the timid sheep when&nbsp;rabid butts furiously at the enemy before which in health it would&nbsp;have fled in terror. This inversion of sentiment is sometimes valuable in diagnosing the malady ; it is so common that it may be&nbsp;said to be present in every case of rabies. When, therefore, a dog,&nbsp;contrary to its habits and natural inclination, becomes suddenly&nbsp;aggressive to other dogs, it is time to take precautions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the large majority of instances the dog is inoffensive in the early period of the disease to those to whom it is familiar. It then&nbsp;flies from its home and either dies, is killed as “ mad,” or returns in&nbsp;a miserable plight, and in an advanced stage of the malady, when the&nbsp;desire to bite is irresistible. It is in the early stage that sequestration and suppressive measures are most valuable. The dogs which&nbsp;propagate the disease are usually those that have escaped from&nbsp;their owners. After two or three days, frequently in about twelve&nbsp;hours, more serious and alarming symptoms appear, ferocious instincts are developed, and the desire to do injury is irrepressible.&nbsp;The animal has an indefinable expression of sombre melancholy&nbsp;and cruelty. The eyes have their pupils dilated, and emit flashes&nbsp;of light when they are not dull and heavy ; they always appear so&nbsp;fierce as to produce terror in the beholder ; they are red and their&nbsp;sensibility to light is increased ; and wrinkles, which sometimes&nbsp;appear on the forehead, add to the repulsive aspect of the animal.&nbsp;If caged it flies at the spectator, emitting its characteristic howl or&nbsp;bark, and seizing the iron bars with its teeth, and if a stick be&nbsp;thrust before it this is grasped and gnawed. This fury is soon succeeded by lassitude, when the animal remains insensible to every&nbsp;excitement. Then all at once it rouses up again, and another&nbsp;paroxysm of fury commences. The first paroxysm is usually the&nbsp;most intense, and the fits vary in duration from some horns to a&nbsp;day, and even longer; they are ordinarily briefer in trained and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
