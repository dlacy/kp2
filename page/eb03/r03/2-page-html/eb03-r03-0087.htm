<p><span class="font0">victorious monarch. However, in the reign of Miecz-ſlaus II. the ſucceſſor of Boleſlaus, the Ruffians again ſhook off the yoke, and a laſting peace was confirmed&nbsp;by the marriage of Mieczſlaus with the filler of Wolo-domir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jari∏aus now continued to enjoy the empire quietly, and was ſo much addicted to reading, that he devoted&nbsp;even a part of the night to his ſtudies. He invited&nbsp;men of letters to his court, and cauſed many Greek&nbsp;books to be tranſlated into the Ruffian language. It&nbsp;was he that in the year 1019, gave the people of Nowgorod ſeveral laws, under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gramota Sou-d,inaia,</span><span class="font0"> to be obſerved in the courts of juſtice. Theſe&nbsp;are the firſt laws that were reduced to writing in Ruſſia ; and, what renders them remarkable, is the conformity they have with thoſe of the other northern nations. He founded a public ſehool at Novogorod,&nbsp;where he maintained and educated 300 children at his&nbsp;own expence. His court was the moſt brilliant of the&nbsp;north, and furniſhed an aſylum to unfortunate princes.&nbsp;He died in 1052 ; and fell into the ſame error which&nbsp;his father had committed, by dividing his dominions&nbsp;among his five fons. This produced a repetition of the&nbsp;bloody ſcenes which had been acted by the fons of&nbsp;Wolodomir ; the Poles took the advantage of the diſ-tractcd ſtate of affairs to make continual inroads and&nbsp;invaſions ; and the empire continued in the moſt deplorable ſituation till the year 1237, when it was totally&nbsp;ſubdued by the Tartars. We are not informed of any&nbsp;particulars of this remarkable event, farther than that&nbsp;innumerable multitudes of theſe barbarians, headed by&nbsp;their khan Batto, or Battus, after ravaging great part&nbsp;of Poland and Sileſia, broke ſuddenly into Ruſſia, where&nbsp;they committed the greateſt cruelties. Moſt of the&nbsp;RuſſiaH princes, among whom was the great duke&nbsp;George Sevoloditz, were made priſoners, and racked to&nbsp;death ; and, in ſhort, none found mercy but ſuch as acknowledged themſelves the ſubjects of the Tartars. The&nbsp;imperious conqueror impoſed upon the Ruffians every&nbsp;thing that is moſt mortifying in llavery ; inſiſting that&nbsp;they ſhould have no other princes than ſuch as he approved of ; that they ſhould pay him yearly a tribute, to be&nbsp;brought by the fovereigns themſelves on foot, who&nbsp;were to preſent it humbly to the Tartarian ambaſſador&nbsp;on horſeback. They were alſo to proſtrate themſelves&nbsp;before the haughty Tartar ; to offer him milk to drink;&nbsp;and, if any drops of it fell down, to lick theιq up ; a&nbsp;ſingular mark of ſervility, which continued near 260&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>i</sup> George Seyolodſtz was ſucceeded by his brother Michael Sevoloditz Zernigouſki ; who oppoſed the Tartars, but was defeated by them, and loſt his life. He left three fons, Feodor, Alexander, and Andrew, whoſe&nbsp;wars with each other ended in the death of them all.&nbsp;A fon of Alexander, and of the ſame name, was then&nbsp;placed on the throne by the Tartqrs ; and his ſon Da-nilow, or Daniel Alexandrovitz, removed his court&nbsp;from Wolodimir to Moſcow, where he firſt aſſumed the&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Great duke oſ Wolodimir and Moſcow.</span><span class="font0"> Daniel&nbsp;Alexandrovitz left two fons, Gregory and John ; the&nbsp;former of whom, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kalita,</span><span class="font0"> from a purſe he uſed&nbsp;always to carry about him filled with money for the&nbsp;poor, aſcended the throne ; but he was ſoon aſſaſſinated&nbsp;by another prince named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Demetri Michaelovit%,</span><span class="font0"> who&nbsp;was himſelf put to death for it by the Tartars ; and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">John, </span><span class="font1">likewiſe ſurnamed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kalita,</span><span class="font0"> was then </span><span class="font1">made czar. </span><span class="font0">This John left three fons, John, Simon, anti Andrew ;&nbsp;and the eldeſt of theſe, commonly called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ivan Ivano-vit%,</span><span class="font0"> was made czar, with the approbation of the Tartars, on whom he was dependenr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During theſe ſeveral reigns, which fill a ſpace oſ upwards of 100 years, and which all hiſtorians have paffed over for want of records concerning them, the miſeries&nbsp;of a foreign yoke were aggravated by all the calamities&nbsp;of inteſtine diſcord and war ; whilſt the knights of Livonia, or brothers of the ſhort-ſword, as they are ſometimes called, a kind of military order of religious, on&nbsp;one ſide, and the Poles on the other, catching at the&nbsp;opportunity, attacked Ruſſia, and took ſeveral of itβ<sub>χ&nbsp;</sub>towns, and even ſome conſiderable countries. The&nbsp;Tartars and Ruffians, whoſe intereſts were in this caſe&nbsp;the ſame, often united to oppoſe their common enemies ; but were generally worſted. The Livonians&nbsp;took Pleſkow ; and the Poles made themſelves mailers&nbsp;of Black Ivuſſia, the Ukraine, Podolia, and the city of&nbsp;Kiow. Caſimir the Great, one of their kings, carried&nbsp;his conqueſts ſtill farther. He aſſerted his pretenſions&nbsp;to a part of Ruſſia, in right of his-relation to Boleſlaus&nbsp;duke of Halitz, who died without iſſue, and forcibly&nbsp;poſſeſſed himſelf of the duchies of Perzemyſlia, Halitz,&nbsp;and Luckow, and of the diſtricts of Sanock, Luback-zow, and Trebowla ; all which countries he made a&nbsp;province oſ Roland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The newly-conquered Ruffians were ill-diſpoſed to brook the government of the Poles ; whoſe laws and&nbsp;cuſtoms were more contrary to their own than thoſe of&nbsp;the Tartars had been. They joined the latter to rid&nbsp;themſelves of the yoke ; and aſſembled an army numerous enough to overwhelm all Poland, but deſtitute of&nbsp;valour and diſcipline. Caſimir, undaunted by this deluge of barbarians, preſented himſelf at the head of a&nbsp;few troops on the borders of the Viſtula, and obliged&nbsp;his enemies to retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Demetrius Ivanovitz, ſon of Ivan Ivanovitz, who commanded in Moſcow, made frequent efforts to rid&nbsp;himſelf of the galling yoke. He defeated in ſeveral&nbsp;battles Maymay khan of the Tartars ; and, when conqueror, refuſed to pay them any tribute, and aſſumed&nbsp;the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of great duke oſ Mulcoνy.</span><span class="font0"> But the oppreſſors&nbsp;ol the north returned in greater numbers than before ;&nbsp;and Demetrius, at length overpowered, after a ſtruggle&nbsp;of three years, periſhed with his whole army, which,&nbsp;it we may credit hiſtorians, amounted to upwards of&nbsp;240,oco men. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Baſilius Demetrivitz revenged his father’s death. He attacked his enemies, drove them out of his dominions, and conquered Bulgaria. He made an alliance&nbsp;with the Poles, whom he could not ſubdue ; and even&nbsp;ceded to them a part of his country, on condition that&nbsp;they ſhould help him to defend the reſt againſt any new&nbsp;incurſions of the Tartars. But this treaty was a weak&nbsp;barrier againſt ambition. The Ruffians found new enemies in their allies ; and the Tartars ſoon returned.—&nbsp;Baſilius Demetrivitz had a ſon who was called after&nbsp;his name, and to whom the crown ought naturally to&nbsp;have deſcended. «But the father, ſuſpecting his legitimacy, left it to his own brother Gregory, a man of </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſevere and tyrannical diſpoſition, and therefore hated by&nbsp;the people, wlι∙o aſſerted the fon’s right, and proclaimed him their fovereign. I he Tartars </span><span class="font1">took cognizance</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
