His father Jacques B. M. Bins, comte de Saint-Victor (1772-1858), is remembered by his poem</hi> <hi rend="italic">L’Espérance,</hi> and by an excellent verse translation of Anacreon.</p><p>Saint-Victor, who ceased to use the title of count as being out of keeping with his democratic principles, began as a dramatic critic on the <hi rend="italic">Pays</hi> in 1851, and in 1885 he succeeded Théophile Gautier on the <hi rend="italic">Presse.</hi> In 1866 he migrated to the <hi rend="italic">Liberté,</hi> and in 1869 joined the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur universel.</hi> In 1870, during the last days of the second empire, he was made inspector-general of fine arts. Almost all Saint-Victor’s work consists of articles, the best known being the collection entitled <hi rend="italic">Hommes et dieux</hi> (1867). His death interrupted the publication of <hi rend="italic">Les Deux Masques,</hi> in which the author intended to survey the whole dramatic literature of ancient and modern times. Saint-Victor’s critical faculty was considerable, though rather onesided. He owed a good deal to Théophile Gautier, but he carried ornateness to a pitch far beyond Gautier’s. Saint-Victor died in Paris on the 9th of July 1881.</p><p>See also Deljant, <hi rend="italic">Paul de Saint-Victor</hi> (1887).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
