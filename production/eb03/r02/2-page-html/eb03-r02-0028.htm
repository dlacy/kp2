<p><span class="font0">RINGS. The antiquity of rings is known from Scripture and profane authors. Judah left his ring or&nbsp;ſignet w<sup>τ</sup>ith Tamar (Gen. xxxviii. 18). When Pharaoh committed the government of all Egypt to Joſeph, he took his ring from his finger, and gave it to&nbsp;Joſeph (Gen. xli. 42). After the victory that the&nbsp;jſraelites obtained over the Midianites, they offered to&nbsp;the Lord the rings, the bracelets, and the golden necklaces, and the ear-rings, that they had taken from the&nbsp;enemy (Numb, xxxi. 50). The Iſraelitiſh women&nbsp;wore rings not only on their fingers, but alſo in their&nbsp;noſtrils and their ears. St James diſtinguiſhes a man&nbsp;of wealth and dignity by the ring of gold that he&nbsp;wore on his finger (James ii. 2). At the return of&nbsp;the prodigal ſon, his father orders him to be dreſſed in&nbsp;a new fuit of clothes, and to have a ring put upon his&nbsp;finger (Luke xv. 22). When the Lord threatened&nbsp;King Jeconiah with the utmoſt effects of his auger, he&nbsp;tells him, that though he wore the ſignet or ring upon&nbsp;his finger, yet he ſhould be torn off (Jer. xxii. 24 )</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ring was uſed chiefly to<sup>,</sup>fεal with; and the Scripture generally puts it in the hands of princes and great perſons ; as the king of Egypt, Joſeph, Ahaz, Jezebel,&nbsp;King Ahaſuerus, his favourite Haman, Mordecai, who&nbsp;ſucceeded Haman in his dignity, King Darius ( 1 Kings&nbsp;xxi. 8. ; Eſther iii. Ίο, &amp;c. ; Dan. vi. 17). The patents and orders of theſe princes were ſealed with their&nbsp;rings or ſignets ; and it was this that ſecured to them&nbsp;their authority and reſpect.

<p><span class="font0">RIOT, in law. The riotous aſſembling of 12 perſons, or more, and not diſperfing upon proclamation, w<sup>,</sup>as ſir ſt made high treaſon by ſtatute 3' &amp; 4 Edw∖ VI.&nbsp;c. 5. when the king was a minor, and a change of religion to be effected.: but that ſtatute was repealed by&nbsp;ſtatute I Mar. c. 1. among the other treaſens created&nbsp;ſince the 25 Edw, III. ; though the prohibition was in&nbsp;ſubſtance re-enacted, with an inferior degree of puniſh-ment, by ſtatute 1 Mar. ſt. 2. c. 12. which made the&nbsp;ſame offence a ſingle felony. Theſe ſtatutes ſpecified&nbsp;and particularized the nature of the riots they were&nbsp;meant to ſuppreſs ; as, for example, ſuch as were ſet on&nbsp;foot with intention to offer violence to the privy-council, or to change the laws of the kingdom, or for&nbsp;certain other ſpecific purpeſes ; in which caſes, if the&nbsp;perſons were commanded by proclamation to diſperſe,&nbsp;and they did not, it was by the ſtatute of Mary&nbsp;made ſelony, but within the benefit of clergy ; and&nbsp;alſo the act indemnified the peace-officers and their&nbsp;affiliants, if they killed any of the mob in endeavouring to ſuppreſs ſuch riot. This was thought a neceſſary ſecurity in that ſanguinary reign, when popery&nbsp;was intended to be re-eſtabliſhed, which was like to&nbsp;produce great diicontents : but at firſt it was made&nbsp;only ſor a year, and w<sup>,</sup>as afterwards continued for that&nbsp;queen’s life. And, by ſtatute 1 Eliz. c. 16. when a&nbsp;reformation in religion was to be once more attempted,&nbsp;it w<sup>,</sup>as revived and continued during her life alſo ; and&nbsp;then expired. From the acceſſion of James I. to the&nbsp;death of Queen Anne, it was never once thought expedient to ιevive it ; but, in the firſt year of George I.&nbsp;it was judged neceſſary, in order to ſupport the execution of the act of ſettlement, to renew it, and at one&nbsp;ſtroke to make it perpetual, with large additions. For,&nbsp;whereas the former acts expreſsly defined and ſpecified&nbsp;what ſhould be accounted a riot, the ſtatute 1 Geo. I.&nbsp;c. 5. enacts, generally, that if any 12 perſons are unlawfully aſſembled to the diſtutbance of the peace, and&nbsp;any one juſtice of the peace, ſheriff, under ſheriff, or&nbsp;mayor of a town, ſhall think proper to command them&nbsp;by proclamation to diſperſe, if they contemn his orders&nbsp;and continue together for one hour afterw<sup>τ</sup>ards, ſuch&nbsp;contempt ſhall be felony without benefit of clergy.&nbsp;And farther, if the reading of the proclamation be by&nbsp;force oppoſed, or the reader be in any manner wilfully</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
