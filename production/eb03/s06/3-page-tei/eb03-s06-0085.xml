The Engliſh eſtabliſhed a factory here in 1609, the Dutch in 1616, and the French in 1665. In proceſs of time, the Indian ſeas being greatly infeſted by pirates, a naval officer was appointed by the Mogul to keep them in awe. This officer was named <hi rend="italic">Siddee @@(A) Muſſoot,</hi> who had been chief of an Ethiopian colony settled at Rajapore. Here he had collected ſome veſſels of conſiderable force, and carried on some trade, till he was dispoſſeſſed by the Mahrattas ; upon which he repaired to Bombay, and afterwards to Surat, where he was appointed admiral on that ſtation to the Mogul, with a yearly revenue of about L. 36,000 Sterling. Though he had no power, independent of the marine, he ſeized on the caſtle, encroached on the town, and appropriated to himſelf a third part of its revenues, under pretence of arrears due in his appointed revenue. Another third was paid to the Mahrattas, to prevent their depredations upon trade in the open country ; but they, not ſatisfied with this ſtipulation, watched an opportunity to plunder the town, which was kept in ſubjection by Siddee Muſſoot till his death, which happened in 1756.</p><p>Siddee Muſſoot was ſucceeded by his ſon, who ſoon rendered himſelf very diſagreeable to the inhabitants. In 1758 the Engliſh factory was greatly oppreſſed by him, and the black merchants treated ſtill worſe ; on which the latter applied to Mr Ellis the Engliſh chief at that time, desiring him to recommend it to the preſidency of Bombay to take the caſtle by force out of the hands of the uſurper. This propoſal proving agreeable, Admiral Pococke, who was then with his ſquadron at Bombay, readily concurred in ſupporting the expedition. The enterprize was conducted with the usual ſucceſs attending the Britiſh arms ; and Captain Maitland the conductor took poſſeſſion of the caſtle with its revenue in name of the Eaſt India company, who were confirmed in the government by grants from the Mogul.</p><p>SURCHARGE OF <hi rend="smallcaps">the Forest,</hi> is when a commoner puts more beaſts in the foreſt than he has a right to.

It ſometimes forms but a ſingle range along the ſhore, and at others three or four behind one another extending perhaps half a mile out to ſea. The ſurf begins to affirme its form at ſome distance ſrom the place where it breaks, gradually accumulating as it moves forward till it gain, not uncommonly, in places within the limits of the trade-winds, a height of 15 or 20 feet, when it overhangs at top, and falls like a caſcade with great force and a prodigious noiſe. Countries where ſurfs prevail require beats of a particular conſtruction very different from the greater part of thoſe which are built in Europe. In ſome places ſurfs are great at high, and in others at low water; but we believe they are uniformly moſt violent during the ſpring-tides.</p><p>It is not easy to aſſign the cauſe of ſurfs. That they are affected by the winds can hardly be queſtioned ; but that they do not proceed from the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> operation of the wind in the places where they happen, is evident from this circumſtance, that the ſurf is often higheſt and moſt violent where there is leaſt wind, and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa.</hi> On the coaſt of Sumatra the higheſt are experienced during the ſouth-eaſt monſoon, which is never attended with ſuch gales as the north-west. As they are most general in the tropical latitudes, Mr Marſden, who ſeems to have paid much attention to the ſubject, attributes them to the trade-winds which prevail at a distance from ſhore between the parallels of 30 degrees north and south, whoſe uniform and invariable action cauſes a long and constant swell, that exists even in the calmeſt weather, about the line, towards which its direction tends from either side. This swell, when a ſquall happens or the wind freſhens up, will for the time have other ſubſidiary waves on the extent of its ſurface, breaking often in a direction contrary to it, and which will again subſide as a calm returns, without having produced on it any perceptible effect. Sumatra, though not continually expoſed to the ſouth-eaſt trade-wind, is not ſo distant but that its influence may be preſumed to extend to it ; and accordingly at Poolo Peſang, near the ſouthern extremity of the iſland, a conſtant ſoutherly ſea is obſerved, even after a ſtrong north-west wind. This incessant and powerful ſwell rolling in from an ocean, open even to the pole, ſeems an agent adequate to the prodigious effects produced on the coaſt ; whilſt its very size contributes to its being overlooked. It reconciles almoſt all the difficulties which the phenomena ſeem to preſent, and in particular it accounts for the decreaſe of the ſurf during the north-weſt monſoon, the local wind then counteracting the operation of the general one ; and it is corroborated by an obſervation, that the ſurfs on the Sumatran coaſt ever begin</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> When the Abyſſinian ſlaves are promoted to any office under the Mogul government, they are called <hi rend="italic">Siddees</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
