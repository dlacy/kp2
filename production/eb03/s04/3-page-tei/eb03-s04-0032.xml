            <p>of ſkill and attention devote their time to the raiſing of ſilk worms. This is an
                employment that will not interfere with any manufacture already eſtabliſhed ; on the
                contrary, it would afford a reſpectable, a lucrative, and agreeable employment to
                ladies, or to females in general, who have at preſent too few profeſſions to which
                they can apply. The ſociety inſtituted at London for the encouragement of arts,
                manufactures, and commerce, much to their honour, have offered premiums to those who
                ſhall plant a certain number of mulberry trees.</p>
            <p>The following method of raiſing mulberry trees from seed is practiſed in the ſouth of
                France, and has been repeated with ſucceſs in the Eaſt Indies by Dr Anderson of
                Madras. “ Take the ripe berries of the mulberry when it is full of juice and of
                feeds. Next take a rough horſe hair line or rope, ſuch as we dry linen on, and with
                a good handful of ripe mulberries run your hand along the line bruiſing the berries
                and maſhing them as much as poſſible as your hand runs along, ſo that the pulp and
                ſeeds of the berries may adhere in great abundance to the rope or hair line. Next
                dig a trench in the ground where you wiſh to plant them, much like what is practiſed
                in kitchen gardens in England for crops of various kinds. Next cut the rope or hair
                line into lengths according to the length of the trench you think fit to make, and
                plunge the line full of maſhed berries into the trench, and then cover it over well
                with earth, always remembering afterwards to water it well, which is eſſential to
                the ſucceſs. The ſeeds of the berries thus sown will grow, and ſoon ſhoot out young
                ſuckers, which will bear young leaves, which are the beſt food for the ſilk
                worm.</p>
            <p>" The facility and rapidity with which young leaves may by this means be produced is
                evident, for as many rows of trenches may thus be filled as can be wiſhed ; and it
                can never be neceſſary to have mulberry trees higher than our raſpberries, currants,
                or gooſeberry buſhes. Whenever they get beyond that, they lose their value ; and if
                theſe trenches ſucceed, you may have a ſupply coming freſh up day after day, or any
                quantity you pleaſe.” Thus abundance of theſe trees might be reared. But as mulberry
                trees are not yet found in abundance in this country, it were to be wiſhed that ſome
                other food could be ſubſtituted in their place : attempts have accordingly been made
                by thoſe who have reared ſilk worms, and it has been found poſſible to ſupport the
                ſilk worm upon lettuce @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(b).</hi></p>
            <p>Miſs Henrietta Rhodes, a lady who has made ſome ſucceſsful experiments on raiſing
                ſilk worms in England, had found that the ſilk worm could with ſafety be kept on
                lettuce for ſome time.@@ This is pretty generally known by ladies who have turned
                their attention to this ſubject ; but ſhe found that in general they could not with
                ſafety be kept upon that food above three weeks. If longer fed upon that plant, the
                worms for the moſt part die without ſpinning a web at all. She found, however, that
                they did not always die, but that in ſome caſes they produced very good cocoons,
                even when fed entirely on lettuce. She therefore with reaſon ſuſpected that the
                death of the animal muſt be occaſioned by ſome extraneous circumſtance, and not from
                the poiſonous quality of the food itſelf ; the circumſtance ſhe ſuſtpected, from
                ſome incidental obſervations, was the coldneſs of that food ; and therefore ſhe
                thought it was not impoſſible, but if they were kept in a very warm place, while fed
                on lettuce, they might attain, in all caſes, a due perfection.</p>
            <p>General Mordaunt having been informed of this conjecture, reſolved to try the
                experiment. He got ſome ſilk worms eggs, had them hatched in his hot-houſe, and
                cauſed them to be all fed upon lettuce and nothing elſe. They proſpered as well as
                any worms could do, few or none of them died; and they afforded as fine cocoons as
                if they had been fed upon mulberry leaves. As far as one experiment can go, this
                affords a very exhilarating proſpect in many points of view. If one kind of food has
                been noxious, merely on account of an improper temperature, others may be found
                which have been hurtful only from a ſimilar cauſe ; ſo that it is not impoſſible but
                we may at laſt find that this delicate creature may be ſupported by a variety of
                kinds of food. Few, however, could be more eaſily obtained than lettuce ; and this
                plant, when cabbaged (the coſs, or ice lettuce eſpecially), would poſſeſs one
                quality that the mulberry leaf never can poſſeſs, from the want of which many
                millions of worms die in thoſe countries where ſilk is now reared ; for it is
                obſerved, that when the leaves are gathered wet, it is ſcarcely poſſible to preſerve
                the worms alive for any length of time ; ſo that during a continuance of rainy
                weather many of them are unavoidably cut off ; but a lettuce, when cabbaged, reſiſts
                moiſture. If gathered, even during rain, the heart of it is dry ; ſo that if the
                outer leaves be thrown aſide at that time, the worms would be continued in perfect
                health. The expence, too, of cultivating and gathering lettuce, would be ſo much
                leſs than that of gathering mulberry leaves, as to occasion a ſaving that would be
                much more than ſufficient to counterbalance the expence of heating the conſervatory,
                as a little reflection will ſhow.</p>
            <p>But the great point to be now ascertained is, whether it is a fact that worms fed on
                lettuce, if kept in a due temperature, will continue in good health, in general,
                till they ſhall have perfected their cocoon ? One experiment is too little to
                eſtabliſh this fact with perfect certainty. It would therefore be neceſſary that
                more experiments ſhould be made on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that Dr Lodovico Bellardi, a learned and ingenious botaniſt of Turin, has,
                after a number of experiments, diſcovered a new method of feeding ſilk worms, when
                they are hatched before the mulberry trees have produced leaves, or when it happens
                that the froſt deſtroys the tender branches. This new method conſiſts in giving the
                worms dried leaves of the mulberry-tree. One would think that this dry nouriſh-</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(b)</hi> It is not improbable, ſays Dr Anderſon, to whoſe
                valuable work entitled the <hi rend="italic">Bee,</hi> we have been much indebted in
                the drawing up of this article, that other kinds of food may be found which will

                they have the ſame lacteſcent quality with the lettuce.</p>
