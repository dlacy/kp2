<p><span class="font1">Welsh as their own man, a champion of the beaten Celts retiring westward to the mountain-fastnesses before the&nbsp;victorious Saxons. They have lost sight of the fact that&nbsp;there were always Cymry in Wales, who must have re-garded their brothers in Loegria (England) much in the&nbsp;same way as they did those of Strathclyde, namely, as&nbsp;kinsmen and allies sometimes, as fair game for attack and&nbsp;plunder more frequently. The struggle between the Celtic&nbsp;and Germanic race was a long one, and it can only have&nbsp;been after the power of the Romanized Britons of Loegria&nbsp;and of the men of Strathclyde was broken, in the battles&nbsp;to which we may attach the name of Arthur, that the tide&nbsp;of war reached Wales along with the British fugitives who&nbsp;crowded thither and to Brittany ; hence the appearance&nbsp;of Roman names among the British warriors. It may be&nbsp;surmised that Arthur is not a name but a title given to a&nbsp;Strathclyde warrior, corresponding to the Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperator.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The traces of Roman occupation and of Roman culture were not wholly effaced for many centuries in the west of&nbsp;England, and, besides the Latin quasi-historical writings&nbsp;attributed to Gildas and Nennius, there must have been&nbsp;something like a British Livy and a British Virgil in&nbsp;existence between the time of Constantine and that of the&nbsp;pseudo classical compositions of Geoffrey of Monmouth and&nbsp;Joseph of Exeter. It is quite certain that the work we&nbsp;call by the name of Nennius did not furnish all the sub-ject-matter of Geoffrey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia,</span><span class="font1"> and the mysterious old&nbsp;volume which his friend William of Wallingford brought&nbsp;to him from Brittany about 1130 must have contained&nbsp;poetic legends as well as prose pseudo-history. Another&nbsp;mysterious volume is the “ Latin book ” in the monastery at Salisbury, to which the romancists of 1160-1220&nbsp;professed to have resorted for their narratives. In Geoffrey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia,</span><span class="font1"> compiled, as he says, from William of&nbsp;Wallingford’s book, we find three elements blended—(1)&nbsp;the epic of Brutus (which must have been written in&nbsp;Britain before 300) ; (2) a record of British kings down&nbsp;to the Saxon invasion (probably a corrupt version of the&nbsp;same real history that appears distorted and truncated in&nbsp;Nennius); (3) the lives of Arthur, Guenhumara, and Merlin&nbsp;(old British popular legends, wrought into union with a&nbsp;later Cymric tradition in which the British or Gadelic&nbsp;Arth-vaur, Art-vor, or Ard-tur had been converted into a&nbsp;Welsh king Arthur).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Round Table romances had their starting-point in Geoffrey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia,</span><span class="font1"> first published in 1138-39, revised and&nbsp;republished in its present form in 1147.@@<sup>2</sup> Yet there is no&nbsp;mention in Geoffrey of Lancelot and Tristan, two heroes&nbsp;of much greater importance in the romances than Arthur&nbsp;himself. It does not seem to have been observed before&nbsp;that there is a curious set of resemblances between the&nbsp;personages of the romances and those of the Homeric&nbsp;siege of Troy. The names of Arthur and Uter suggest&nbsp;Atrides (Menelaus and Agamemnon rolled into one) ;&nbsp;Mark, again, is Menelaus; Guenhumara and Yseult are</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">like Helen, Guenhumara also resembling Chryseis and Briseis ; Lancelot and Tristan are like Achilles and Paris.&nbsp;Lancelot becomes for a time the enemy of his king&nbsp;(Arthur = Atrides) and stands aloof from him ; he is unsuccessful in his quest of the Grail, as Achilles dies before&nbsp;Troy is taken ; his son Galaad, like the Achilleid Neo-ptolemus, achieves the father’s unfinished task. Lancelot&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lanc-e-loc =</span><span class="font1"> child of the lake) is brought up in concealment by the Lady of the Lake, just as Thetis (the goddess&nbsp;of the sea) brings up her son Achilles, disguised as a girl,&nbsp;in obscurity. Chiron, to whose care the young Achilles&nbsp;is at first entrusted by Thetis, resembles Merlin, the friend&nbsp;or lover of the Lady of the Lake, in his half divine, half&nbsp;human nature.@@<sup>3</sup> Again, not only does Galaad by his name&nbsp;remind us of the hero of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Achilleidos</span><span class="font1"> (it must have&nbsp;been as usual to give this genitive name to the poem of&nbsp;Statius as that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eneydos</span><span class="font1"> to Virgil’s), but there are other&nbsp;curious similitudes. The name of King Perles or Pelles,&nbsp;by whose daughter Lancelot becomes the father of Galaad,&nbsp;is suggestive of, or may have been suggested by, the&nbsp;Græco-Latin appellation of Achilles, Pelides son of Peleus.&nbsp;One of the meanings that has been suggested for the&nbsp;name of Lancelot is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l'ancelot =</span><span class="font1"> the serving man, in reference to one of the incidents of his story. Although a different origin is hinted at above, it would not be inappropriate to designate Achilles in his female disguise at Delos&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l’ancillet</span><span class="font1"> ( = the male damsel, in attendance on Deidamia).&nbsp;As in the old Greek poems we have Atrides and Pelides&nbsp;contesting for Briseis, and the minor Atrides, Menelaus,&nbsp;similarly contending with Paris the ravisher of Helen, so&nbsp;in the romances we find Guenhumara the object of mutual&nbsp;strife between her lover Lancelot and her husband Arthur,&nbsp;son of Uter Pendragon, and Yseult the cause of war&nbsp;between King Mark and Tristan. Again, a resemblance&nbsp;is to be found in the incidents of fabulous birth between&nbsp;Arthur and Hercules, Arthur and Alexander the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These observations are not intended to contradict the claims of the Cymric people to have furnished the romances&nbsp;with much of their material ; for it would be difficult to&nbsp;resist the evidence of such names as Tristan and Yseult,&nbsp;which indicate sufficiently their British or Breton origin,&nbsp;and even Lancelot might have been, as first suggested&nbsp;above, a Welsh or British translation of an epithet which&nbsp;would apply to Achilles in connexion with the following&nbsp;words from Statius.@@<sup>4</sup> Thetis says (as the Lady of the&nbsp;Lake might have said of Lancelot)—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Sæpe ipsa (nefas ! ) sub inania natum Tartara et ad Stygios iterum fero mergere fontes ; ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while her son’s guardian, Chiron, is named in the same place “ Carpathius vates,” which at once reminds us of the&nbsp;“Caledonius vates ” (Merlin) of Geoffrey of Monmouth. At&nbsp;the same time the name of Guenhumara (Guinevere) makes&nbsp;one think of Thetis, the white-footed lady of the sea.&nbsp;As the name Guenhumara certainly preceded in date all&nbsp;the Anglo-French romances and is undoubtedly an old one,&nbsp;we may as well say at once that the intention is here to&nbsp;suggest an hypothesis that Britain produced Latin poets&nbsp;during the time of the Roman occupation, who wrote works&nbsp;not only on the fable of a British descent from the Trojans&nbsp;through Brutus, a fabled kinsman of Æneas, but also on&nbsp;the various subjects of classic mythology, the stories of&nbsp;Thebes, Troy, the Golden Fleece, and Alexander.@@<sup>5</sup> This</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name Arthur is found for the first time in Nennius (where&nbsp;the hero is said not to be a king but only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dux bellorum).</span><span class="font0"> He explains&nbsp;it as meaning either the “dreadful bear” or the “iron hammer.”&nbsp;Now, although the former may refer equally well to Cymric and&nbsp;to Gaelic, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., αrth-vaur</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">art-νor,</span><span class="font0"> the alternative sense is better&nbsp;sought in Gaelic, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ord,</span><span class="font0"> a hammer, being a known word in that language,&nbsp;while there is no trace of it in Cymric. The second syllable of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">orddur</span><span class="font0"> is common to both languages, equivalent to the Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">durus,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;has assumed in Welsh the meaning of “ steel. ” It probably also meant&nbsp;“ iron.” This observation shows that Nennius did not know whether&nbsp;the name was a Gaelic or a Cymric one, and the mere uncertainty is&nbsp;in itself an argument that Arthur was distinctly not Cambrian. If it&nbsp;were permissible to seek a purely Gaelic etymology for Arthur we&nbsp;should find it in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">αrd-tuτ=αltus dux,</span><span class="font0"> high chief or generalissimo. In&nbsp;the two early authorities Gildas and Bede the British champion of the&nbsp;5th century is named Ambrosius Aurelius, a man of Roman family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His poem on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life and Prophecies of Merlin</span><span class="font0"> was a separate&nbsp;work, published in 1136-37 and again in 1149.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of several beings of this mixed nature in the early&nbsp;romances begin with the same word, mer, merhl, or mel, as Merlin,&nbsp;Melusine, Melior, Melion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh of Rutland’s poem of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ipomedon</span><span class="font0"> (written in 1185) evinces&nbsp;by the names of its personages such an. acquaintance with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thebais&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Statius as the maker of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lancelot</span><span class="font0"> seems to have had with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Αehilleis</span><span class="font0"> of the same poet. He usually calls his King Arthur Atreus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yguerne, the name of Arthur’s mother, was perhaps akin in its&nbsp;original British sense (although in Cymric it means “ the true ” or “ the faithful ”) to “Alcmena,” and may have meant “manly,” “robust.”&nbsp;Arthur proves his fitness for kingship by the performance of wonderful feats like the labours of Hercules.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
