                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Epistle to the.</hi> The origin of the Christian community
                    at Rome is involved in obscurity. According to Catholic tradition it was founded
                    by Peter, who was its bishop for a quarter of a century. But neither allegation
                    has historical support. The most striking proof of the contrary is precisely
                    this epistle of Paul. It does not contain the remotest reference to either the
                    one fact or the other. And if Paul had written such an epistle to a community
                    founded by Peter he would not only have violated the agreement mentioned in Gal.
                    ii. 9, but would also have gone against his own principle of refraining from
                    intrusion on the mission fields of others (Rom. xv. 20 ; 2 Cor. x. 16). But
                    neither was Paul the founder of the church in Rome. This also is shown by the
                    present epistle, in which he for the first time opens relations with a community
                    already formed. Thus we are thrown upon mere conjecture. In pursuing the
                    investigation we have this fact to start from, that even before the Christian
                    era there already existed in Rome a strong Jewish colony. After the conquest of
                    Jerusalem by Pompey (63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> numbers of Jewish
                    prisoners of war were brought to Rome and there sold as slaves. Of these many
                    were soon afterwards emancipated by their masters, Jewish slaves being a
                    peculiarly inconvenient kind of property on account of the strictness of their
                    observance of their law, especially in the matter of clean and unclean meats
                    (Philo, <hi rend="italic">Leg. ad Caium,</hi> ii. 568, ed. Mangey). These
                    freedinen became the nucleus of a Jewish community, which ultimately settled in
                    Trastevere and organized itself into an independent religious communion. It
                    rapidly increased and became an important element in the life of the capital. By
                    the time of Herod’s death (4 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> the independent
                    Jews of Rome—that is, besides women and children—already numbered 8000 according
                    to Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Antiq.,</hi> xvii. 11, 1 ; .5Æ <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jud.,</hi> ii. 6, 1). In the reign of Tiberius indeed this large and
                    powerful organization was dissolved at a single stroke, a decree of the senate
                    (19 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> having sent to Sardinia for military service
                    all Jews capable of bearing arms (Tac., A»»., ii. 85 ; Suet., <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tiber.,</hi> 36 ; Joseph., <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> xviii. 3, 5). It
                    is probable, however, that after the death (31 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    of Sejanus, to whom this measure had been mainly due, the Jews were expressly
                    permitted to return to Rome, for we are told by Philo <hi rend="italic">(Leg. ad
                        Caium,</hi> ii. 569, ed. Mangey) that after the death of his favourite
                    Tiberius perceived the Jews to have been unjustly calumniated, and ordered the
                    authorities to refrain from oppressing them. At all events the community must
                    ultimately have come together again, for in the reign of Claudius its existence
                    is again presupposed, the idea of expelling the Jews from the capital having
                    anew been entertained under that emperor. Regarding this proposal, however,
                    accounts vary. According to the Acts of the Apostles (xviii. 2), and also
                    Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Claud.,</hi> 25), it was actually carried out; but
                    according to Dio Cassius (lx. 6) the expulsion was only proposed, and, when it
                    was seen to be impracticable without great tumult, all that was done was to
                    withdraw from the Jews their right of meeting. The latter version is doubtless
                    the more correct. The withdrawal of the right of meeting was equivalent to the
                    prohibition of public worship, and sufficiently explains why numbers left the
                    city (Acts xviii. 2). But the main body must have remained and doubtless have
                    again obtained the privilege of assembly, for from the time of Nero onwards we
                    find the Jews in Rome once more flourishing with undiminished vigour.</p>
                <p>From the midst of this Jewish community it was that the Christian congregation
                    doubtless arose. The Jews of the Dispersion, it is well known, kept up an active
                    correspondence with the mother-country in Palestine. Every year they sent their
                    gifts and offerings thither, and every one in a position to do so went in person
                    to the great festivals of the Holy City. As a result of this vigorously
                    maintained intercourse, which was aided also by the interests of trade, tidings
                    of Jesus as the promised Messiah did not fail to reach the capital of the
                    empire. Individual Jews who had become believers came forward in Rome as
                    preachers of the gospel and found acceptance with a section of their countrymen.
                    They found a perhaps still more numerous following among the “God-fearing” or
                    “devout” <hi rend="italic">(creßopevoi, cjioßovfj.evoi,</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> tou</hi></hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">öeov)</hi> heathen, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> within that
                    large circle which consisted of those who had adopted the faith of the Jews,
                    observed certain of the more important precepts of their law, and also attended
                    their public worship, but did not, strictly speaking, belong to the communion,
                    and thus represented a sort of Judaism of the second order. <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Many scholars
                        identify these “devout” heathen with the “proselytes of the gate ” who are
                        met with in Rabbinical literature; but in reality the two are quite distinct
                        and unrelated. </note> In proportion as faith in Jesus as the Messiah gained
                    ground within the Jewish community, a separation between the believers and the
                    others would of course become more</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb09-20-r03-0728" facs="encyclopediabrit20newyrich_raw_0752.jp2"/>
                <p>and more inevitable. Under what circumstances and conditions the separation
                    actually took place is not now known. We may be sure, however, that it was not
                    brought about without violent internal commotions; it is probable even that the
                    edict of Claudius itself may have had its occasion in these. The remark of
                    Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Claud.,</hi> 25) readily admits of being
                    interpreted in such a sense: “Judaeos impulsore Chresto <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> The vulgar pronunciation “Chrestus”
                        for “Christas” is borne witness to in other passages (Tert., <hi
                            rend="italic">Apol.,</hi> 3, and <hi rend="italic">Ad Nat.,</hi> i. 3;
                        Lactan., <hi rend="italic">Inst. Div.,</hi> iv. 7, 5). </note> assidue
                    tumultuantes Roma expulit.” So interpreted, these words contain our first notice
                    of the Christian Church in Rome; its earliest constitution must have taken place
                    precisely then. For, as has already been seen, the edict of banishment was
                    probably never carried out, or at all events did not continue long in force.
                    Unfortunately, we do not know the date of it, but it must have belonged to the
                    later years of Claudius, for in the beginning of his reign the disposition of
                    that emperor towards the Jews was friendly (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi>
                    xix. 5). In its context also Acts xviii. 2 implies a late rather than an early
                    date, say about 50-52 a.d. ; and there is nothing against this in the
                    circumstance that the edict is mentioned by Dio Cassius towards the beginning of
                    his account of that reign, for in that particular passage the author is
                    characterizing his subject in a general way and not referring to events in their
                    chronological sequence.</p>
                <p>If the foregoing suppositions are correct, Paul’s epistle to the church at Rome
                    was written some six or eight years after its formation. Paul was staying in
                    Corinth at the time, in the last month before the eventful journey to Jerusalem
                    which led to his captivity (58 a.d.). The evidence that the epistle was written
                    during this last sojourn in Greece, which is only briefly alluded to in Acts xx.
                    2, 3, is simple and conclusive. We know from the Epistles to the Corinthians
                    that shortly before this stay the apostle had set on foot throughout the
                    churches of Macedonia and Achaia a collection on behalf of the needy church at
                    Jerusalem (1 Cor. xvi.; 2 Cor. viii.-ix.). This collection it was his wish to
                    carry in person from Corinth (1 Cor. xvi. 3-6; 2 Cor. i. 16; Acts xxiv. 17). But
                    the Epistle to the Romans was written, as we learn from the author himself (Rom.
                    xv. 21-28), when the collection had just been concluded and he was on the point
                    of taking it with him to Jerusalem,—in other words, before his departure from
                    Corinth, but not long before.</p>
                <p>We have now to inquire into the motive which led the apostle precisely at such a
                    juncture to address a communication so full and elaborate as this to the
                    Christian community at Rome, with which he had no personal acquaintance. In
                    general terms we have it from himself at the beginning and end of the epistle
                    (i. 8-15, xv. 14 <hi rend="italic">sq.~).</hi> He had proclaimed the gospel in
                    all the East from Jerusalem to Illyricum (xv. 19). He regarded his work in these
                    quarters as for the present finished, and he felt impelled to preach Christ
                    crucified also in the West. He was already looking towards Spain (Rom. xv. 24,
                    28). He wished first to take the collection to Jerusalem, and, that once
                    accomplished, his labours in the West were to begin forthwith. But there, in
                    Rome, the metropolis of the world, a community already existed which had come
                    into being apart from any effort of his. For his activity in the West it was
                    obviously of the utmost importance to secure the organization for himself and
                    his message. Should its attitude be cold, he would be left without any secure
                    base of operations. The purpose of the present epistle, then, is, to speak
                    generally, this: to secure a connexion with the community at Rome, to gain it
                    for himself and the gospel he carried. But had it hitherto been without that
                    gospelThe community was at any rate already a Christian one.</p>
                <p>And, if perhaps it was in need of fuller teaching, why did he not wait until he
                    arrived in person in Rome in order to give it ? Surely he could have done this
                    more effectually by word of mouth than by a written treatise. Why, then, did he
                    send this written message before him ? There must have been some perfectly
                    definite circumstances which led him to take this course. The nature of these
                    will become clear to us when we seek to ascertain what at that juncture was the
                    state of the Christian community in Rome.</p>
                <p>Assuming that church to have arisen out of the midst of the Jewish community of
                    the place, the most obvious conjecture is that at the period of the present
                    letter it still continued to consist mainly of Jewish Christians, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that the majority of its members were Jews by birth
                    who even after their conversion to Christ still continued to regard the Mosaic
                    law in its totality as binding on them. This is the view which Baur in
                    particular sought to establish, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    </note> as against the previously prevailing belief in the Gentile Christian
                    character of the church in question. Baur’s position was adopted by many
                    subsequent critics, the most careful and elaborate defence of it, though with
                    many modifications in detail, being that of Mangold. <note anchored="true"

                    </note> who, however, recognizes in Baur’s hypothesis certain elements of truth
                    by which the older theory must be corrected and supplemented.</p>
                <p>In presence of the facts we are compelled to adopt the view of Weizsacker as on
                    the whole the right one. For the Jewish Christian character of the church Baur
                    and Mangold, besides the argument from its presumable origin, have adduced a
                    number of isolated texts. On the majority of these Mangold no longer lays any
                    stress, since they admit of being otherwise interpreted. Thus when Paul
                    designates Abraham as “our father” (top <hi rend="italic">irpoird.Topa
                        rjpuov,</hi> iv. 1) he indeed includes his readers under the <hi
                        rend="italic">rjpMV.</hi> But in 1 Corinthians, an epistle certainly
                    addressed to a church of Gentile Christians, the fathers of Israel are also
                    called “our fathers” (1 Cor. x. 1). The Christian Church is in point of fact the
                    true Israel; hence the patriarchs of Israel are its “fathers.” <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="8"> The words <hi
                            rend="italic">Kara. oäpKa,</hi> in Rom. iv. 1 are not to be construed
                        with <hi rend="italic">n-poTTCLTopa. ggoiv</hi> but with the verb <hi
                            rend="italic">evpgKivai.</hi> Abraham is thus designated as “our father
                        ” only in the spiritual and not in the physical sense. </note> In another
                    place (Rom. vii. 1) Paul addresses his readers as persons “who know the law.”
                    But this holds true not of born Jews alone but of Gentile Christians as well, to
                    whom also the Old Testament was a sacred book. Mangold finds an “ irrefragable
                    evidence of the Jewish Christian character of the community in Rome” in Rom.
                    vii. 4 : “ye also, beloved brethren, have died to the law ” (k&lt;xi 7/xets
                        <hi rend="italic">edavarud'qTe</hi>

                        once lived under it: so argues Mangold quite correctly. But the inference

                <p>in such a case they must have been born Jews is nevertheless a rash one. Not the
                    Jews only, who possess the written law, but the whole of pre-Christian mankind
                    are in Paul’s conception ideally under the law,—under its bondage and curse. For
                    all alike redemption is a redemption from the law’s penalty and dominion. Hence
                    Paul can say even to born Gentiles, e^avarw^Te <hi rend="smallcaps">tw
                        vo/xw.</hi> But according to Baur and Mangold the decisive evidence for the
                    Jewish Christian character of the Roman Christians is the whole substance of the
                    present epistle. All its arguments have for their aim to establish and vindicate
                    the free gospel of Paul as against the objections of the Judaizers. They
                    therefore conclude that it can have been designed only for
                    Judaistically-disposed readers whom Paul seeks by these representations to win
                    for his gospel. This line of argument is at bottom sound, and Baur has rendered
                    a real service by showing that the epistle is by no means an outline of the
                    Pauline dogmatic as a whole, but is simply an elucidation of such points in it
                    as were offensive to the Judaically-minded. A brief review of its contents will
                    make this clear.</p>
                <p>The epistle falls into two unequal parts,—a theoretical (i.-xi.) and a hortatory
                    (xii.-xvi.). The latter is almost of the nature of a mere appendix. The proper
                    kernel of the epistle, that for the sake of which it came to be written, is
                    found in the theoretical exposition of the first eleven chapters. These again
                    fall into two sections,—chaps, i.- v. laying the positive foundations of the
                    Pauline gospel as freed from the law, and chaps, vi.-xi. containing the
                    vindication of that gospel against objectors. Having shown directly in chaps,
                    i.-v. that we can attain righteousness and so salvation not along the path of
                    legal observance but only along the path of faith, that is to say, believing
                    apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, he goes on in chap. vi. to refute
                    point by point the positions of the Judaizers. He shows that in the freedom from
                    the law the freedom to sin is by no means involved ; on the contrary, it is with
                    the believer an inherent necessity that he should live a new life in his
                    fellowship with Christ (chap, vi.), and precisely by that fellowship is he for
                    the first time truly enabled so to live (chap. viii.). The law cannot give him
                    this power ; it only commands, and does not at the same time give strength to
                    obey. Hence, although good in itself, it has for men only a pernicious effect,
                    inasmuch as by its injunctions sinful desire is excited (chap. vii.). A special
                    objection of the Judaizers against the activity of Paul was also this,—that he
                    should have turned to the heathen while still the greater part of Israel
                    remained unconverted. His answer to this is contained in chaps, ix.-xi. On the
                    one hand, it is Israel’s own fault to have rejected its salvation ; on the other
                    hand, such has been God’s will. Israel is at present rejected in order that the
                    heathen may step into the gap thus made. Yet the rejection of Israel is only for
                    a time. By the admission of the heathen Israel is to be stirred to jealousy and
                    thus at last to be also converted. Precisely in such intricate paths as these is
                    the wonderful depth of the divine wisdom made manifest.</p>
                <p>Thus all the theoretical disquisitions of the epistle are in reality neither
                    more nor less than a vindication and a polemic against the Jewish Christian
                    point of view. But are we to conclude from this that the readers were themselves
                    Jewisli Christians ? Such an inference has against it the fact that Paul, both
                    at the beginning and at the close of his epistle, clearly designates them as
                    Gentile Christians. In i. 5, 6, and i. 13-15, as well as in xv. 15, 16, he
                    appeals to his office as apostle of the Gentiles as justifying him in now
                    writing to the church at Rome and in proposing further labours there. In xi. 13,
                    also, the readers are spoken to as of Gentile birth. The arguments by which Baur
                    and Mangold seek to weaken the force of this passage are very far-fetched. If,
                    then, the Roman Christians were Gentiles by blood, the theory of Beyschlag, that
                    they were Gentile Christians in origin but Jewish Christians by conviction,
                    appears to have most to commend it in view of the contents of the epistle. If
                    the epistle stopped short at the end of chap, xiii., we should indeed be
                    compelled to adopt that theory. But the remaining chapters (xiv., xv.) suggest
                    much rather that the majority were by conviction also Gentile Christians and
                    emancipated from the law. For in the chapters specified Paul deals with a
                    division that has arisen within the community. One section still remained in the
                    bonds of the strictest legal scrupulosity: they regarded a vegetable diet
                    (Ad^ara) as alone permissible, rejecting the use of animal food (xiv. 2), and
                    they also observed certain days (xiv. 5), by which, there can be no doubt, the
                    Jewish sabbaths and festivals must be understood. In fact they were legal Jewish
                    Christians, but Jewish Christians who in their asceticism went beyond the
                    precepts of Mosaism, which indeed prohibits the use of the flesh of unclean
                    animals, but not animal food in general. Over against these Jewish Christian
                    ascetics, called by Paul “the weak in the faith,” stood another section, whom he
                    describes as “the strong.” They rejected these legal observances, taking their
                    stand on the gospel as freed from the law. But the latter must have been in the
                    majority, for they are exhorted by the apostle to have a tender regard for the
                    weakness of their brethren, and not by any harsh terrorism to force them into
                    any courses which might offend their consciences. Such an exhortation, as
                    Weizsacker remarks, would have no meaning if the representatives of the freer
                    view were not in the majority. The majority, then, of the church at Rome was
                    Gentile Christian not only by origin but by conviction.</p>
                <p>Here two problems arise, neither of which received sufficient attention from
                    critics before Baur : (1) How are we to explain the origin, outside the limits
                    of Paul’s activity, of a Christian community thus free from the fetters of the
                    law <hi rend="italic">1</hi> and (2) How came it about that Paul should have
                    addressed to such a community a letter like this,—adapted, as it appears to be,
                    for Jewishly-inclined readers ? As regards the first question, in the absence of
                    adequate materials for a conclusive solution, our answer can only be
                    conjectural. The problem is a difficult one, because, following Gal. ii., we
                    must start with the assumption that the communities founded under the more
                    direct influence of the original apostles did not reject the Jewish law. In
                    seeking, then, to account for the existence of a community which had so done, we
                    must carry with us the fact that within the wide limits of the Jewish Dispersion
                    very various degrees of strictness in observance of the law were to be found.
                    Even those who were in the truest sense members of the communities of the
                    Dispersion can hardly have observed the law as strictly as did the Pharisees in
                    Palestine. But the demands made on those “ God-fearing ” Gentiles who were wont
                    to attach themselves, more or less' closely, to the Jewish communities must of
                    course have been still more accommodating. If only they accepted the
                    monotheistic religion and its worship without the use of images, the ceremonial
                    precepts laid upon them were reduced to a bare minimum,— the observance of
                    Sabbaths, and also of some laws regarding meat. Now the community at Rome seems
                    to have chiefly arisen out of the circles of such “God-fearing” Gentiles. As
                    Paul himself gained access for the preaching of the gospel, at Thessalonica, for
                    example, principally among the “ God-fearing Greeks ” (Acts xvii. 4), so also in
                    Rome do these seem to have been the main element in the church. On this
                    assumption we can understand how</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb09-20-r03-0730" facs="encyclopediabrit20newyrich_raw_0754.jp2"/>
                <p>from the outset the community had not been in the habit of observing the Mosaic
                    law. At most it was observed in isolated details, and as new members continued
                    to be added from the outer heathen world these relics of Jewish custom received
                    less and less prominence, fading away in presence of the faith in Jesus as the
                    Redeemer. It is possible that influences from Pauline circles may also have come
                    into play, but of this we cannot be sure.</p>
                <p>If such were the circumstances in which the majority of the community in Rome
                    had been brought to their attitude of freedom towards the law, that attitude was
                    one of fact rather than of principle. The law was not observed ; but there was
                    no clear consciousness that it had no obligatory force. A community thus placed
                    had no firm basis from which to withstand a Judaizing agitation when it should
                    arise. In such an event there was the greatest danger to its very existence. It
                    is here, then, that we must look for the real occasion of the present epistle.
                    Paul was afraid that the Judaizers who had wrought with such effect within the
                    churches founded by himself in Galatia and Corinth might also lay hold on that
                    at Rome. Perhaps they had already arrived there and the apostle knew it. At all
                    events he perceived a threatening danger. He was unwilling to delay till he
                    could visit the church personally, and accordingly sent forthwith an elaborate
                    document in establishment and vindication of the gospel as free from the law, so
                    that the Roman Christians might be confirmed in their free practice and might be
                    strengthened to withstand the agitations of Judaizers. This is the explanation
                    of the fact that a letter addressed to a Gentile Christian church, not in
                    bondage to the law, is yet almost entirely devoted to the refutation of the
                    Judaistic positions.</p>
                <p>The genuineness of the epistle is practically undisputed ; not so, however, its
                    integrity. Baur (as had already been done by Marcion in ancient times) disputed
                    the genuineness of the last two chapters (xv., xvi.), chiefly on the ground that
                    in them a spirit of concession towards the weak is urged in a wholly un-Pauline
                    manner. Luclit <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9">

                    spurious in these chapters in a very complicated manner, but substantially on
                    the lines of Baur’s criticism. The most thorough discussion of Baur’s and
                    Lucht’s views is that of Mangold, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    refusing to attribute to the apostle the chapters in question. All the
                    exhortations to concession do not, after all, go beyond the principle acted on
                    by Paul himself (1 Cor. ix. 20),—“to the Jews I became as a Jew that I might win
                    the Jews.” In two points, however, the defence does not hold : (1) the doxology
                    at the close (Rom. xvi. 25-27) appears certainly to be from a later hand; <note

                            rend="italic">op. eit.,</hi> pp. 44-81. </note> (2) ch. xvi. 3-20 seems
                    to be genuinely Pauline indeed, but not to belong to the present epistle. Not
                    only is the large number of salutations in a letter addressed to a community
                    personally unknown to the apostle in itself strange ; but salutations also occur
                    addressed to persons whom one would expect to find rather at Ephesus than at
                    Rome (ver. 3, Aquila and Priscilla; ver. 5, Epaenetus) and in districts where
                    the apostle had resided and laboured (xvi. 7, 9, 13). Not without reason,
                    therefore, is it conjectured that here we have a fragment of an epistle to the
                    Ephesians which by mistake has come to be incorporated with that to the Romans.

                        found precisely in Roman inscriptions of the period of the emperors, hut the
                        fact is more striking than convincing. The names in themselves are common.
                        It is not to the names but to the persons characterized that we have to
                        look. But of these it is difficult to believe that they should all have been
                        living in Rome. </note>
