an extensive district in Afghanistan, situated about the thirty-fourth degree of north latitude, and partly bounded by the Indus. The country rises to a great elevation, consisting of snow-clad mountains, interspersed with fertile valleys producing all the finest fruits of Europe. It is about seventy miles in length by forty in breadth, and contains twenty-five valleys, each watered by a separate stream. It is principally inhabited by the tribe of the Yusufzies, who, taking advantage of the difficult passes and strong situations abounding in the country, have not only held themselves independent of the Mogul sovereigns, but have made inroads into their territories. They are a brave and independent people, ready to contribute their quota of troops to any plundering expedition, or in defence of the country.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
