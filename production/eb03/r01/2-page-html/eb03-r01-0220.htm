<p><span class="font1">ſubmitted. But the leading people oſ the important town and harbour of Toulon entered into a negociation, and ſubmitted to the Britiſh admiral Lord Hood,&nbsp;under condition that he ſhould preſerve as a depoſtt the&nbsp;town and ſhipping for Louis XVII. and under the ſti-pulation that he ſhould affiſt in reſtoring the conſtitu-tion of 1789. The ſiege of Toulon was commenced&nbsp;by General Cartaux in the beginning of September.&nbsp;It continued without much vigour during that and the&nbsp;whole of the ſucceeding month. Neapolitan, Spaniſh,&nbsp;and Engliſh troops, were brought by ſea to affiſt in its&nbsp;defence. In the beginning of November, General Cartaux was removed to tlie command of tlie army in Italy,&nbsp;and General Dugommier ſucceeded him. General O’&nbsp;Hara arrived with reinforcements from Gibraltar, and&nbsp;took upon him the command of tlie town, under a&nbsp;commiffion from his Britannic majeſty. On the 30th&nbsp;of November, the garriſon made </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">powerful ſally&nbsp;to deſtroy ſome batteries tliat were erecting upon&nbsp;heights which commanded tlie city. The French were&nbsp;ſurpriſed, and the allies ſucceeded completely in tlieir&nbsp;object; but, elated by the facility of thcir conqueſt, the&nbsp;allied troops ruſhe'd forward in purſuit of the flying&nbsp;enemy, contrary to their orders, and were unexpected-ly met by a ſtrong French force tliat was drawn out to&nbsp;protect the fugitives. General O’Hara now came from&nbsp;the city to endeavour to bring off liis troops with regularity. He was wounded in tlie arm and taken priſoner. Ί he&nbsp;total loſs of tlie allies in this affair was eſtimated at nearly&nbsp;one thouſand men. Tlie French liad now muſtered in&nbsp;full force around Toulon, and prepared for tlie attack.&nbsp;It was begun on tlie 19th of December in the morning, and was chiefly directed againſt Fort Mulgrave,&nbsp;defended by the Britiſh. This fort was protected by&nbsp;an entrenched camp, 13 pieces of cannon, 36 and 24&nbsp;pounders, &amp;c. 5 mortars, and 3000 troops. Such was&nbsp;the ardour of affault, that it was carried in an hour,&nbsp;and the whole garriſon was deſtroyed or taken. The&nbsp;allies now found it impoffible to defend the place ; and&nbsp;in the courſe of the day embarked tlieir troops, after&nbsp;having ſet on ſire tlie arſenal and ſhips. A ſcene of&nbsp;confuiion here enſued, ſuch as has not been known in&nbsp;the hiſtory of modern wars. Crowds of people of every rank, age, and ſex, hurried on board the ſhips, to&nbsp;avoid the vengeance of their enraged countrymen.&nbsp;Some of the inhabitants began to ſire upon their late&nbsp;allies ; others in deſpair were ſeen plunging into the&nbsp;ſea, making a vain effort to reach the ſhips ; or putting&nbsp;an end at once to their own exiſtence upon the ſhore.&nbsp;Thirty-one ſhips of the line were ſound by the Britiſh&nbsp;at Toulon; thirteen were left behind; ten were burnt;&nbsp;four had been previouſly ſent to the French ports of&nbsp;Breſt and Rochefort, with 5000 republicans who could&nbsp;not be truſted ; and Great Britain finally obtained by&nbsp;this expedition three ſhips of the line and ſive fri-gates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the ſide of Spain the war produced nothing of importance ; and in the mountainous country of Piedmont it went on ſlowly. Nice and Chamberry were&nbsp;ſtili retained by the French ; but more terrible ſcenes&nbsp;were acting in other quarters. In La Vendee a moſt&nbsp;bloody war was perſiſted in by the royaliſts. In that&nbsp;quarter of tlie country the language of the reff of France&nbsp;is little underſtood. Tlie people were ſuperſtitious, and&nbsp;had acquired little idea of the new opinions that had</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">lately been propagated ln the reſt of the empire. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font1">were chiefly headed by prieſts, and regarded their cauſe&nbsp;as a religious one. Their mode of warfare uſually was,&nbsp;to go on in their ordinary occupations as peaceable citizens, and ſuddenly to aſſemble in immenſe bands, inſomuch that at one time they were ſaid to amount to&nbsp;150,000 men. They beſieged Nantz and the city of&nbsp;Orleans, and even Paris itſelſ was not thought altoge-ther ſafe fiom their enterpriſes. The war was inconceivably bloody. Neither party gave quarter ; and La&nbsp;Vendee proved a dreadful drain to the population of&nbsp;France. On the 28th of June, the conventional general Biron drove the royaliſts from Lucon ; and Nantz&nbsp;was relieved by general Beyffer. After ſome ſucceſs,&nbsp;general Weſterman was ſurpriſed by them, and compelled to retreat to Parthenay. In tlie beginning of&nbsp;Auguſt the royaliſts were defeated by general Roffig-nol ; but on the 10th of that month, under Charette&nbsp;their commander in chief, they again attacked Nantz,&nbsp;but ſuffered a repulſe. It would be tedious to give </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">minute detail of this obſcure but cruel war. The roy-aliſts were often defeated and ſeemingly diſperſed,&nbsp;but as often aroſe in crowds around the aſtoniſhed re-publicans. At laſt, however, about the middle of Oc-tober, they were completely defeated, driven from La&nbsp;Vendée, and forced to divide into ſeparate bodies. One&nbsp;of theſe threw itſelf into the iſiand of Noirmoutier,&nbsp;where they were ſubdued ; another took the road of&nbsp;Maine and Brittany, where they ſtruggled for ſome&nbsp;time, againſt their enemies, and were at 'ſaſt cut to&nbsp;pieces or diſperſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The royaliſts had long expected affiſtance from England; and an armament under the earlof Moira was actual-ly fitted out for that ſervice, but it did not arrive till too late, and returned home without attempting a landing.&nbsp;—The Mountain party always diſgraced their ſucceffes&nbsp;by dreadful cruelties. Humanity is ſhocked, and hiſto-ry would almoſt ceafe to obtain credit, were we to ſtate&nbsp;in detail the unrelenting cruelties which were exerciſed&nbsp;againſt the unfortunate royaliſts, chiefly by Carrier, a&nbsp;deputy from the convention, ſent into this quarter with&nbsp;unlimited powers. Multitudes of priſoners were crowded on board veffels in the Loire, aſter which the veffels&nbsp;were ſunk. No age nor ſex was ſpared ; and thefe executions were performed with every circumſtance of wanton barbarity and inſult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the ſide of the Rhine a great variety of events occurred during the months of Auguſt and September.&nbsp;Several engagements at ſirſt took place, in which the&nbsp;French were, upon the whole, ſucceſsful. In Septem-ber, however, Landau was inveſted by the combined&nbsp;powers ; and it was refolved to make every poffible ef-ſmt to drive the French from the ſtrong lines of weiſ-ſembourg, on the river Lauter. On the 13th of Oc-tober, the Auſtrian general wurmſer made a grand&nbsp;attack upon thefe lines. ſ'he French fay that their&nbsp;generals betrayed them, and ſuffered the lines to be taken almoſt without reſlſtance. The general of the al-lies confeffed that the lines might have held out for&nbsp;ſeveral days. The French retreated to Hagenau, from&nbsp;wliicli they were driven on tlie 18th ; and ſuffered two&nbsp;other defeats on the 25th and 27th. Some of the principal citizens of Straſhourg now fent a private deputa-tion to general wurmſer, offering to ſurrender the&nbsp;town, to be preſerved as a depoſit to be reſtored to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
