<p><span class="font0">carriages, mail carriages or travelling post offices, luggage brake vans, horse-boxes and carriage-trucks. Passenger carriages&nbsp;were originally modelled on the stage-coaches which they&nbsp;superseded, and they are often still referred to as “ coaching&nbsp;stock. ” Early examples had bodies about 15 ft. long, 6½ ft.&nbsp;wide and 4¾ ft. high; they weighed 3 or 4 tons, and were&nbsp;divided into three compartments holding six persons each, or&nbsp;eighteen in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The distinction into classes was made almost as soon as the railways began to carry passengers. Those who paid the highest&nbsp;fares (2½d. or 3d. a mile) were provided with covered vehicles,&nbsp;on the roofs of which their luggage was carried, and from the&nbsp;circumstance that they could book seats in advance came the&nbsp;term “ booking office, ” still commonly applied to the office&nbsp;where tickets are issued. Those who travelled at the cheaper&nbsp;rates had at the beginning to be content with open carriages&nbsp;having little or no protection from the weather. Gradually,&nbsp;however, the accommodation improved, and by the middle of&nbsp;the 19th century second-class passengers had begun to enjoy&nbsp;“ good glass windows and cushions on the seat, ” the fares they&nbsp;paid being about 2d. a mile. But though by an act of 1844 the&nbsp;railways were obliged to run at least one train a day over their&nbsp;lines, by which the fares did not exceed the “ Parliamentary ”&nbsp;rate of 1d. a mile, third-class passengers paying 1¼d. or 1½d. a&nbsp;mile had little consideration bestowed on their comfort, and&nbsp;were excluded from the fast trains till 1872, when the Midland&nbsp;railway admitted them to all its trains. Three years later&nbsp;that railway did away with second-class compartments and&nbsp;improved the third class to their level. This action had the&nbsp;effect, through the necessities of competition, of causing travellers&nbsp;in the cheaper classes to be better treated on other railways,&nbsp;and the condition of the third-class passenger was still further&nbsp;improved when Parliament, by the Cheap Trains Act of 1883,&nbsp;required the railways to provide “ due and sufficient ’’ train&nbsp;accommodation at fares not exceeding 1d. a mile. In the&nbsp;United Kingdom it is now possible to travel by every train, with&nbsp;very few exceptions, and in many cases to have the use of&nbsp;restaurant cars, for 1d. a mile or less, and the money obtained&nbsp;from third-class travellers forms by far the most important item&nbsp;in the revenue from passenger traffic. Since the Midland&nbsp;railway’s action in 1875 several other English companies have&nbsp;abandoned second-class carriages either completely or in part,&nbsp;and in Scotland they are entirely unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the continent of Europe there are occasionally four classes, but though the local fares are often appreciably lower than in&nbsp;Great Britain, only first and second class, sometimes only first&nbsp;class, passengers are admitted to the fastest trains, for which in&nbsp;addition a considerable extra fare is often required. In Hungary&nbsp;and Russia a zone-tariff system is in operation, whereby the&nbsp;charge per mile decreases progressively with the length of the&nbsp;journey, the traveller paying according to the number of zones&nbsp;he has passed through and not simply according to the distance&nbsp;traversed. In the United States there is in most cases nominally&nbsp;only one class, denominated first class, and the average fare&nbsp;obtained by the railways is about 1d. per mile per passenger.&nbsp;But the extra charges levied for the use of parlour, sleeping and&nbsp;other special cars, of which some of the best trains are exclusively&nbsp;composed, in practice constitute a differentiation of class,&nbsp;besides making the real cost of travelling higher than the figures&nbsp;just given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In America and other countries where distances are great and passengers have to spend several days continuously in a&nbsp;train sleeping and resta urant cars are almost a necessity,&nbsp;and accordingly are to be found on most important&nbsp;through trains. Such cars in the United States are&nbsp;largely owned, not by the railway companies over&nbsp;whose lines they run, but by the Pullman Car Company,&nbsp;which receives the extra fees paid by passengers for their use.&nbsp;Similarly in Europe they are often the property of the International Sleeping Car Company (Compagnie Internationale des&nbsp;Wagons-Lits), and the supplementary fares required from those&nbsp;who travel in them add materially to the cost of a journey. In&nbsp;the United Kingdom, where the distances are comparatively&nbsp;small, sleeping and dining cars must be regarded rather as&nbsp;luxuries; stiff even so, they are to be met with very frequently. The first dining car in England was run experimentally by the&nbsp;Great Northern railway between London and Leeds in 1879,&nbsp;and now such vehicles form a common feature on express trains,&nbsp;being available for all classes of passengers without extra&nbsp;charge beyond the amount payable for food. The introduction&nbsp;of corridor carriages, enabling passengers to walk right through&nbsp;the trains, greatly increased their usefulness. The first English&nbsp;sleeping cars made their appearance in 1873, but they were very&nbsp;inferior to the vehicles now employed. In the most approved&nbsp;type at the present time a passage runs along one side of the&nbsp;car, and off it open a number of transverse compartments or&nbsp;berths resembling ships’ cabins, mostly for one person only, and&nbsp;each having a lavatory of its own with cold, and sometimes&nbsp;hot, water laid on. A charge of 7s. 6d. or 10s., according to&nbsp;distance, is made for each bed, in addition to the first-class fare.&nbsp;In the United States the standard sleeping car has a central&nbsp;alley, and along the sides are two tiers of berths, arranged&nbsp;lengthwise with the car and screened off from the alley by&nbsp;curtains. To some extent cars divided into separate compartments are also in use in that country. On the continent of&nbsp;Europe the typical sleeping car has transverse compartments&nbsp;with two berths, one placed above the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first railway carriages in England had four wheels with two axles, and this construction is still largely employed,&nbsp;especially for short-distance trains. Later, when&nbsp;increased length became desirable, six wheels with&nbsp;three axles came into use; vehicles of this kind were&nbsp;made about 30 ft. long, and contained four compartments for&nbsp;first-class passengers or five for second or third class, carrying&nbsp;in the latter case fifty persons. Their weight was in the&nbsp;neighbourhood of 10 tons. In both the four-wheeled and the&nbsp;six-wheeled types the axles were free to rise and fall on springs&nbsp;through a limited range, but not to turn with respect to the&nbsp;body of the carriage, though the middle axle of the six-wheeled&nbsp;coach was allowed a certain amount of lateral play. Thus the&nbsp;length of the body was limited, for to increase it involved an&nbsp;increase in the length of the rigid wheel base, which was incom-patible with smooth and safe running on curves. (On the&nbsp;continent of Europe, however, six-wheeled vehicles are to be&nbsp;found much longer than those employed in Great Britain. ) This&nbsp;difficulty is avoided by providing the vehicles with four axles&nbsp;(or six in the case of the largest and heaviest), mounted in pairs&nbsp;(or threes) at each end in a bogie or swivel truck, which being&nbsp;pivoted can move relatively to the body and adapt itself to the&nbsp;curvature of the line. This construction was introduced into&nbsp;England from America about 1874, and has since been extensively&nbsp;adopted, being now indeed standard for main line stock. It&nbsp;soon led to an increase in the length of the vehicles; thus in&nbsp;1885 the Midland railway had four-wheeled bogie third-class&nbsp;carriages with bodies 43 ft. long, holding seventy persons in&nbsp;seven compartments and weighing nearly 18 tons, and sixwheeled bogie composite carriages, 54 ft. long and weighing&nbsp;23 tons, which included 3 first-class and 4 third-class compartments, with a cupboard for luggage, and held 58 passengers.&nbsp;The next advance, introduced on the Great Western railway&nbsp;in 1892, was the adoption of corridor carriages having a passage&nbsp;along one side, off which the compartments open, and connected&nbsp;to each other by vestibules, so that it is possible to pass from one&nbsp;end of the train to the other. This arrangement involves a&nbsp;further increase of length and weight. For instance, four-wheeled bogie third-class corridor carriages employed on the&nbsp;Midland railway at the beginning of the 2oth century weighed&nbsp;nearly 25 tons, and had bodies measuring 50 ft.; yet they held&nbsp;only 36 passengers, because not only had the number of compartments been reduced to six, as compared with seven in the&nbsp;somewhat shorter carriage of 1885, by the introduction of a&nbsp;lavatory at each end, but each compartment held only 6&nbsp;persons, instead of 10, owing to the narrowing of its width by&nbsp;the corridor.</span></p>
