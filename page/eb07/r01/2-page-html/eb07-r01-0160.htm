                The&nbsp;eyes are obvious, the feet well developed, and there is an&nbsp;orifice on
                each side of the neck. Besides the range of delicate teeth around the jaws, there is
                a parallel range upon&nbsp;the anterior portion of the palate. The only species

                interior, and&nbsp;the great lakes. @@<sup>1</sup> See Plate CCCCXXXIII. fig.

                formed like tentacu-la. The colour is blackish gray above, and pale
                beneath,&nbsp;without spot or stripe. The observed size varies from six&nbsp;inches
                to two feet. This species inhabits ponds in the vicinity of New Orleans, and is met
                with in other parts of&nbsp;the southern states. It is sometimes found deeply
                sunk&nbsp;in mud, lying concealed like an earthworm, even at the&nbsp;depth of
                several feet. It is greatly dreaded, though without any reason, by the negroes, who

                The species in question measures&nbsp;from eight to ten inches in length, and is of
                a gray colour, spotted with black. It has four toes to the anterior&nbsp;feet, and
                five to the hinder, and there are three long tufted branchiae on each side. (See

                naturally subjected at times to a low temperature.&nbsp;The specimens brought home
                by Mr Bullock were from an&nbsp;elevation of 8000 feet. That collector informed us

                quantities by the peasants. Sir Everard Home has&nbsp;published an account of their
                anatomical structure. He is&nbsp;decidedly of opinion that they are not larvæ, but

                style="font-style:italic;">anguinus (Strenanguina,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                >Schneid.), an animal resembling an eel with legs, of a&nbsp;pale rose or flesh
                colour, and measuring from ten to twelve&nbsp;inches in length, with a diameter
                seldom exceeding half an&nbsp;inch. The muzzle is depressed and elongated ; both
                jaws&nbsp;are furnished with teeth, and the tongue is free in front,&nbsp;but not
                very moveable. The eye is excessively small, and&nbsp;covered over by a kind of
                tegument. The ears are also&nbsp;covered over more substantially, as among the
                salamanders.&nbsp;Besides the internal lungs, there are three feathered gills
                or&nbsp;branchiœ on each side of the posterior portion of the head.&nbsp;The
                skeleton resembles that of the salamanders, except that&nbsp;there are many more
                vertebræ, and fewer rudiments of ribs.&nbsp;The osteology of the head, however, is
                entirely different,&nbsp;and approximates that of the siren. The heart,
                composed&nbsp;of a single ventricle and auricle, is placed between the&nbsp;fore
                legs, and the lungs have the form of simple slender&nbsp;tubes, terminated by a
                vesicular dilatation. This truly remarkable reptile is found occasionally in a noted
                and romantic lake called Zirknitz (the Lugea Palus of the ancients), about six
                German miles from Labac, in the duchy&nbsp;of Carniola. From this lake, as
                extraordinary as its slimy&nbsp;inhabitant, the waters retire during the summer
                season by&nbsp;numerous subterranean outlets, leaving the ground lit
                for&nbsp;pasture and the cultivation of millet. In the month of October they return
                again with great force, springing out of the&nbsp;subterranean passages from a vast
                depth, till the lake is&nbsp;amply filled. It is situated in a hollow or valley,
                surrounded by rocky and wooded hills, in which are great caverns,&nbsp;and is
                supplied by rivulets running into it from the adjoining mountain regions. According
                to M. Schreibers, to&nbsp;whom we owe the first correct account of the proteus,
                    @@<sup>7</sup> its&nbsp;proper locality is Lake Sittich, one of several which
                communicate with that already named. Its more characteristic&nbsp;abode is probably
                among the subterranean canals which&nbsp;are known to connect together those
                peculiar lakes of Car-niola. All its characters, in fact, present the aspect of
                a&nbsp;subterranean animal. It has a pale, bleached, ghost-like&nbsp;aspect, and its
                small, opake, skin-covered eyes bear but&nbsp;small resemblance to the brilliant
                visual organs of other&nbsp;reptiles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We come, finally, to the genus Siren, Linn., in which the posterior
                legs are entirely wanting, and the anterior&nbsp;pair furnished with four toes. We

                of a&nbsp;species of this genus from personal observation,—a mode&nbsp;of acquiring
