<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">taly -acroſs </span><span class="font1">the Tyrrhenian ſea. To the cape where he f</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">irſt </span><span class="font1">landed, he gave the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paiinurus,</span><span class="font1"> ſrom one of&nbsp;his pilots who died there. The little iſland of Leuca∙&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fia, </span><span class="font1">not far diſtant, whither he ſailed next, got its name&nbsp;in like manner from a daughter of Æneas’s filler, who&nbsp;there ended her days. The port of Miſenum, the iſland&nbsp;of Prochyta, and the promontory of Cajeta, where he&nbsp;ſucceſſively arrived’, were ſo called from being the burial places, the firſt of a noble l’rojan his companion,&nbsp;the ſecond of his kinſwoman, and the third of his&nbsp;ηurfe. At length the Trojan prince and his choſen&nbsp;band finiſhed their tedious and painful voyages on the&nbsp;coaſt of the ſince famous Latium. This was a ſmall&nbsp;territory on the eaſt ſide of the river Tiber, containing a part of the preſent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cavpagna di Roma :</span><span class="font1"> Latinus&nbsp;was the king of it ; 'his capital town, Laurentum ; his&nbsp;fubjects, a people who, till his time called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aborigines,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">had from him taken the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Latins.</span><span class="font1"> Here, far&nbsp;removed from their implacable enemies the Greeks,&nbsp;Æneas and his followers undertook to raiſe a ſecond&nbsp;Troy: they fortified a camp near the mouth of the Ty-ber, gave it the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Troy,</span><span class="font1"> and flattered themſelves&nbsp;with the hopes of a quiet ſettlement, and a period to&nbsp;.all their unhappy adventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Æneas arrived in Italy, Latinus was engaged in a war with the Rutuli, a neighbouring people, in&nbsp;which he was attended but with very indifferent ſucceſs,&nbsp;•when news was brought him that a foreign army had&nbsp;made a deſcent on his coaſts, pillaged the maritime part&nbsp;of his dominions, and were fortifying themſelves in a&nbsp;eamp at a ſmall diſtance from the ſea. Hereupon he&nbsp;marched againſt them with all his forces, hoping to&nbsp;oblige them to reimbark and abandon his dominions,&nbsp;without meeting with any great reſiſtance from </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">band of vagabonds, as he ſuppoſed, or pirates, come&nbsp;only to ſeek ſor plunder: but finding them, as he&nbsp;drew near, well-armed, and regularly drawn up, he&nbsp;thought it advifable to forbear engaging troops that&nbsp;appeared ſo well diſciplined ; and, inſtead of venturing&nbsp;a battle, to deſire a parley. In this conference Latinus underſtanding who they were, and being at the&nbsp;ſame time ſtruck with terror, and touched with com-paſſion for thoſe brave but unfortunate men, entered&nbsp;into a treaty with them, and aſſigned them a tract of&nbsp;land for a ſettlement, on condition that they ſhould&nbsp;employ their arms and exert their valour in defence of&nbsp;his dominions, and look upon the Rutuli as a common&nbsp;enemy. This condition Æneas readily accepted; and’&nbsp;complied with his engagement ſo faithfully, that Latinus came at length to repoſe an entire confidence in&nbsp;the Trojan ; and in proof of it gave him Lavinia, his&nbsp;daughter and only child, in marriage, ſecuring to him&nbsp;by that means the ſucceſſion to the throne of Latinm.&nbsp;Æneas, to teftify his gratitude to Latinus, and affection. for Lavinia, gave her name to the camp he&nbsp;had' pitched ; and inſtead of Troy called it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lavi-fiium.</span><span class="font1"> The Trojans followed the example of their&nbsp;leader ; and by making alliances with La∙tin families, became, in a ſhort time, one and the ſame people with&nbsp;the Latins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in the mean time Turnus, the queen’s nephew, who had been brought up in the palace under the eye of&nbsp;Latinus, and entertained hopes of marrying Lavinia&nbsp;and ſucceeding to the throne, ſeeing the princeſs bellowed on a ſtranger, and all his views defeated, went</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">over to the Rutuli ; and by ſtirring them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">up, 'brought </span><span class="font1">on a battle between them and the Latins, in which&nbsp;both he and Latinus were killed. Thus Æneas, by the&nbsp;death of his father-in-law, and by that of a troubleſome&nbsp;rival, came into the quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom of&nbsp;Latium, which he governed with great wiſdom, and&nbsp;tranſmitted to his poſterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Æneas is ſaid to have reigned three years ; during which time he eſtabliſhed the worſhip of the gods of his&nbsp;own country, and to the religion of the Latins added&nbsp;that of Troy. The two Palladiums, which had been&nbsp;the protectors of that city, became the tutelary deities&nbsp;of Lavinium, and, in after ages, of the whole Roman&nbsp;empire. The worſhip of Veſta was likewiſe introduced&nbsp;by Æneas ; and virgins, from her called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peflals,</span><span class="font1"> were&nbsp;appointed to keep a fire continually burning in honour&nbsp;of that goddeſs. Jupiter, Venus, and many other deities&nbsp;who had been revered in Troy, became, in all likelihood, known to the Latins by means of Æneas; which&nbsp;gave occaſion to the poets of repreſenting him under&nbsp;the character of a pious hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While Æneas was thus employed, the Rutuli, ancient enemies of the Latin name, entering into an alliance with Mezentius king of the Tyrrhenians, took the field with a deſign to drive out thoſe new-comers,&nbsp;of whoſe power they began to conceive .no ſmall jea-louſy. Æneas marched out againſt them at the head&nbsp;of his Trojans and Latins. Hereupon a battle enſued,&nbsp;which laſted till night ; when Æneas being puſhed to&nbsp;the banks </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the Numicus, which ran cloſe by Lavinium, and forced into that river, was there drowned,&nbsp;ſt he Trojans concealed his body ; and pretending that&nbsp;he had vaniſhed away on a ſudden, made him paſs for&nbsp;a deity among his credulous ſubjects, who accordingly&nbsp;erected a temple to him under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Jupiter In-diges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon the death of Æneas, his fon Euryleon, called alſo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aſcanius</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lulus,</span><span class="font1"> aſcended the throne ; but as&nbsp;the young king did not think it adviſable to venture&nbsp;a battle in the very beginning of his reign, with a formidable enemy, who promiſed himſelf great ſucceſs&nbsp;from the death of Æneas, he had the prudence to confine himſelf within the walls of Lavinium, and to try&nbsp;whether he could, by an honourable treaty, put an end&nbsp;to ſo dangerous a war. But the haughty Mezentius&nbsp;demanding of the Latins, as one of the conditions of&nbsp;a peace, that they ſhould pay him yearly, by way of&nbsp;tribute, all the wine produced in the territory of Latium, Aſcanius rejected the propoſal with the utmoſh&nbsp;indignation ; and having cauſed all the vines throughout his dominions to be conſecrated to Jupiter, and by&nbsp;that means put it out of his power to comply with the&nbsp;enemy’s requeſt, he reſolved to make a vigorous fally,&nbsp;and try whether he could, by force of arms, bring the&nbsp;inſulting Tyrrhenian to more reaſonable terms. The&nbsp;main body of the enemy’s army was encamped at ſome&nbsp;diſtance from Lavinium ; but Lauſus, the ſon of Mezentius, with, the flower of their youth under his command, lay entrenched at the very gates of the city.&nbsp;The Trojans, who had been long accuſtomed to make&nbsp;vigorous ſallies, marching out in the night, attacked&nbsp;the poſt where Lauſus commanded, forced his entrenchments, and obliged the troops he had with him to ſave.&nbsp;themſelves by flying to the main body of the army en</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">camped on </span><span class="font1">the plain ; but the unexpected arrival and·</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
