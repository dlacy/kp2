In May of 1692 he served under Russell at&nbsp;the battle of Barfleur, and he greatly distinguished himself in&nbsp;a night attack on the French fleet at La Hogue, when he succeeded in burning six of their ships. Shortly afterwards he&nbsp;received the honour of knighthood and a reward of £1000. In&nbsp;1693 he commanded the Smyrna convoy, which was scattered&nbsp;and partly taken by the French admiral Tourville near Lagos&nbsp;Bay. Till the peace of Nymwegcn(i697),he continued to serve&nbsp;in the Channel and Mediterranean. In 1702 he commanded&nbsp;the expedition against Cadiz, and on the passage home destroyed&nbsp;the Plate fleet in Vigo. With Sir Cloudesley Shovel he took&nbsp;part in the capture of Gibraltar on the 21st of July 1704. On&nbsp;the 13th of August of the same year he attacked the French&nbsp;fleet off Malaga, the battle being drawn. On account of the&nbsp;dissatisfaction expressed indirectly at the result of the contest,&nbsp;he retired from the service in February 1705. He died on the&nbsp;24th of January 1709.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">BOON, ALBRECHT THEODOR EMIL, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count von</span><span class="font1"> (1803-1879), Prussian general field-marshal, was born at Pleushagen, near Colberg, in Pomerania, on the 30th of April 1803. His&nbsp;family was of Flemish origin, and was settled in Pomerania. His&nbsp;father, an officer of the Prussian army, died in poverty during&nbsp;the French occupation, and young von Roon was brought up, in&nbsp;a country ravaged in the War of Liberation and in straitened&nbsp;circumstances, by his maternal grandmother. He entered the&nbsp;corps of cadets at Kulm in 1816, whence in 1818 he proceeded&nbsp;to the military school at Berlin, and in January 1821 received a&nbsp;commission in the 14th (3rd Pomeranian) regiment quartered&nbsp;at Stargard in Pomerania. In 1824 he went through the three&nbsp;years’ higher course of study at the war school in Berlin, where&nbsp;he also applied himself with the greatest energy to improving&nbsp;his general education. In 1826 he was transferred to the 15th&nbsp;regiment at Minden, but in the same year was appointed an&nbsp;instructor in the military cadet school at Berlin, where he devoted&nbsp;himself especially to the subject of military geography. lie&nbsp;published in 1832 the well-known </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Physical, National&nbsp;and Political Geography</span><span class="font1">, in three volumes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Grundzüge der Erd-,&nbsp;Völker- und Staaten-Kunde)</span><span class="font1">, which gained him a great reputation,&nbsp;and of which over 40,000 copies were sold in a few years. This&nbsp;work was followed in 1834 by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Geography {Anfangsgründe der Erdkunde),</span><span class="font1"> in 1837 by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Military Geography of Europe&nbsp;{Militärische Länderbeschreibung von Europa),</span><span class="font1"> and in 1839 by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Iberian Peninsula {Die Iberische Halbinsel).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Meantime, in 1832, he rejoined his regiment, and was afterwards attached to the headquarters of General von Miiffling’s corps of observation at Crefeld, when he first became alive to&nbsp;the very inefficient state of the Prussian army. In 1833 he was&nbsp;appointed to the Topographical Bureau at Berlin, in 1835 he&nbsp;entered the General Staff, and in the following year was promoted captain and became instructor and examiner in the&nbsp;military academy at Berlin. In 1842, after an illness of two&nbsp;years brought on by overwork, he was promoted to be major&nbsp;and attached to the staff of the VII. corps, in which post he&nbsp;was again impressed with the inefficiency of the organization of&nbsp;the army, and occupied himself with schemes for its reform.&nbsp;Two years later, as tutor to Prince Frederick Charles, he attended&nbsp;him at Bonn university and in his European travels. In 1848&nbsp;he was appointed chief of the staff of the VIII. Army Corps at&nbsp;Coblenz. During the disturbances of that year he served under&nbsp;the Crown Prince William (afterwards German emperor) in&nbsp;the suppression of the insurrection at Baden, and distinguished</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">himself by his energy and bravery, receiving the 3rd class of the order of the Red Eagle in recognition of his services. While&nbsp;attached to the Crown Prince’s staff at that time he broached&nbsp;to him the subject of his schemes of army reform. In 1850&nbsp;came the revelation of defective organization and efficiency&nbsp;which led to the humiliating treaty of Olmütz. In the same&nbsp;year Roon was made a lieutenant-colonel, and in 1851 full colonel.&nbsp;He now enjoyed the confidence of Prince William, and began&nbsp;active work as reorganizer of the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Promoted to be major-general in 1856 and lieutenant-general in 1859, Roon had held since 1850 several commands and had&nbsp;been employed on important missions. Prince William became&nbsp;regent in 1857, and in 1859 he appointed Roon a member of a&nbsp;commission to report on the reorganization of the army. Supported by Manteuffel and Moltke, *Roon was able to get his&nbsp;plans seriously considered and generally adopted. His aim was&nbsp;to create an armed nation, to extend Scharnhorst’s system&nbsp;and to adapt it to Prussia’s altered circumstances. To attain&nbsp;this he proposed a universal three years’ service, and a reserve&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Landwehr)</span><span class="font1"> for the defence of the country when the army was&nbsp;actively engaged. During the Italian War he was charged with&nbsp;the mobilization of a division. At the end of 1859, though the&nbsp;junior lieutenant-general in the army, he succeeded von Bonin as&nbsp;war minister, and two years later the ministry of marine was&nbsp;also entrusted to him. His proposals of army reorganization&nbsp;met with the bitterest opposition, and it was not until after long&nbsp;fighting against a hostile majority in the chambers that, with&nbsp;Bismarck’s aid, he carried the day. Even the Danish campaign&nbsp;of 1864 did not wholly convince the country of the necessity&nbsp;of his measures, and it required the war with Austria of 1866 to&nbsp;convert obstinate opposition into enthusiastic support. After&nbsp;that von Roon, from being the best-hated man in Prussia,&nbsp;became the most popular, and his reforms were ultimately&nbsp;copied throughout continental Europe. He was promoted&nbsp;general of infantry at the outbreak of this war, was present&nbsp;at the brilliant and decisive victory of Königgratz, and received&nbsp;the Black Eagle at Nikolsburg on the road to Vienna. His&nbsp;system, adopted after 1866 by the whole North German Confederation, produced its inevitable result in the victorious&nbsp;war with France 1870-71, throughout which von Roon was in&nbsp;attendance on the German emperor. The fiftieth anniversary&nbsp;of his entrance into the army was celebrated at Versailles on the&nbsp;19th of January 1871, when the emperor expressed his gratitude for the great services he had rendered. He was created&nbsp;a count, and in December 1871, having resigned the ministries&nbsp;of war and marine, he succeeded Bismarck as president of the&nbsp;Prussian ministry. Ill-health compelled him to resign in the&nbsp;following year. He was promoted to be field-marshal on&nbsp;the ist of January 1873. He died at Berlin on the 23rd of&nbsp;February 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After his death his son published the valuable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Denkwürdigkeiten aus dem Leben des Generatfeldmarschalls Kriegsministers Grafen&nbsp;Roon</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols., Breslau, 1892), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kriegsminister von Roon als Redner&nbsp;politisch und militärisch erläutert</span><span class="font1"> (Breslau, 1895). His correspondence with his friend Professor Cl. Perthes, 1864-67, was also published at Breslau in 1895.</span></p>

Two heavy batteries&nbsp;of artillery are usually stationed in the cantonment. The&nbsp;Thomason Civil Engineering College, founded in 1848, was&nbsp;transferred from the Public Works to the Education Department in 1895 and reorganized. It was instituted in order to&nbsp;train natives in engineering, and students originally received&nbsp;stipends. After 1875 the emoluments were limited, and became&nbsp;in the nature of scholarships, but the education of all students&nbsp;remained practically free till 1896, when fees began to be&nbsp;charged.
