 in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of pentandria, and to the order of monogynia ; and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 43d order, <hi rend="italic">Dumoſae.</hi> The corolla is cut into 10 parts, the laciniæ or ſegments being incurvated alternately ; the ſtigma is ſimple ; the berry contains five ſeeds. There are ten ſpecies: 1. Mite ; 2. Inerme, ſmooth iron-wood ; 3. Melanophleum, laurelleaved iron-wood ; 4. Fcetidiſſimum ; 5. Cymoſum—- both natives of the Cape of Good Hope ; 6. Sericeum, ſilky iron-wood, a native of New South Wales ; 7. Tenax, ſilvery-leaved iron-wood, a native of Carolina ; 8, Lycioides, willow-leaved iron-wood, a native of North America; 9. Spinoſum, thorny iron-wood or argan, a native of Morocco ; 10. Decandrum.</p><p>The wood of theſe trees being very cloſe and ſolid, has given occaſion for this name to be applied to them, it being ſo heavy as to sink in water. As they are natives of warm countries, they cannot be preſerved in this country unless they are placed, the two former in a warm stove, the others in a green-houſe. They are propagated by ſeeds, when theſe can be procured from abroad.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
