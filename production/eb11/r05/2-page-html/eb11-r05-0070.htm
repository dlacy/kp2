<p><span class="font0">the hungry gentleman in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lazarillo de Tormes,</span><span class="font0"> in Don Melón and Doña Endrina he anticipates Calisto and Melibea in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Celestina</span><span class="font0">, and Celestina herself is developed from Ruiz’ Trotaconventos. Moreover, Ruiz was justly proud of his metrical&nbsp;innovations. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Libro de buen amor</span><span class="font0"> is mainly written in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cuaderna via</span><span class="font0"> modelled on the French alexandrine, but he imparts to the measure a variety and rapidity previously unknown&nbsp;in Spanish, and he experiments by introducing internal rhymes&nbsp;or by shortening the fourth line into an octosyllabic verse; or he&nbsp;boldly recasts the form of the stanza, extending it to six or seven&nbsp;lines with alternate verses of eight and five syllables. But his&nbsp;technical skill never sinks to triviality. AU his writing bears&nbsp;the stamp of a unique personality, and, if he never attempts a&nbsp;sublime flight, he conveys with contagious force his enthusiasm&nbsp;for life under any conditions—in town, country, vagabondage&nbsp;or gaol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His influence is visible in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">El Corbacho,</span><span class="font0"> the work of another jovial goliard, Alphonso Martinez de Toledo, arch-priest of&nbsp;Talavera, who wrote more than half a century before the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Libro&nbsp;de buen amor</span><span class="font0"> was imitated by the author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Celestina,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Ruiz is mentioned with respect by Santillana, and that his reputation extended beyond Spain is proved by the surviving fragments&nbsp;of a Portuguese version of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Libro de buen amor.</span><span class="font0"> By some&nbsp;strange accident he was neglected, and apparently forgotten,&nbsp;tiU 1790, when an expurgated edition of his poems was published&nbsp;by Tomás Antonio Sanchez; from that date his fame has&nbsp;steadily increased, and by the unanimous verdict of aU competent&nbsp;judges he is now ranked as the greatest Spanish poet of his&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An accurate edition of his works was published by M. Jean Ducamin at Toulouse in 1901, and he is the subject of Sr. D. Julio&nbsp;Puyol y Alonso’s critical study, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">El Arcipreste de Hita</span><span class="font0"> (Madrid,&nbsp;1906).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. F.-K.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUKWA (sometimes also Rikwa and Hikwa), a shallow lake in German East Africa, lying 2650 ft. above the sea in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">N.W. continuation of the rift-valley which contains Lake Nyasa. The sides of the valley here run in steep parallel walls 30 to 40 m.&nbsp;apart, from S.E. to N.W., leaving between them a level plain&nbsp;extending from about 7J<sup>0</sup> to 8|° S. tThis whole area was&nbsp;probably once covered by the lake, but this has shrunk so that&nbsp;the permanent water occupies only a space of 30 m. by 12 at the&nbsp;S. immediately under the E. escarpment. In the rains its extends&nbsp;some 40 m. farther N., and the north of the plain is likewise then&nbsp;covered with water to a depth of about 4 ft. The rest of the&nbsp;plain is a bare expanse intensely heated by the sun in the dry&nbsp;season, and forming a tract of foul mud near the lake shores.&nbsp;But in 1903-4 the level of the lake rose so that the waters covered&nbsp;the whole depression. The lake has two large feeders, one&nbsp;coming from the W., the other from the S.E. The W. feeder,&nbsp;the Saisi, or Momba, rises in 8o° 50' S., 31<sup>o</sup> 30' E., and traverses&nbsp;a winding valley cut out of the high plateau between lakes&nbsp;Nyasa and Tanganyika. It enters the lake on its N.W. side.&nbsp;The other chief feeder, the Songwe, rises in 9<sup>0</sup> 8' S., 33<sup>o</sup> 30' E.&nbsp;on the same plateau as the Saisi and flows N.W., entering-Rukwa&nbsp;at its S. end. The Songwe is joined about 50 m. about its mouth&nbsp;by the Rupa, whose head-waters are in the high-lying land N.E.&nbsp;of Rukwa. The maximum depth of the lake is about roj ft.&nbsp;Its water is very brackish and of a milky colour from the mud&nbsp;stirred up by the wind. It contains great quantities of fish.&nbsp;First seen from the north by Joseph Thomson in 1880, it was&nbsp;visited by Dr Kaiser, a German, in 1882, and has since been&nbsp;thoroughly explored by various British and German travellers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RULHIÉRE (or Rulhiéres), CLAUDE CARLOMAN DE (1735-1791), French poet and historian, was born at Bondy, near Paris, on the 12th of June 1735. He became aide-de-camp to&nbsp;Marshal Richelieu, whom he followed through the Hanoverian&nbsp;campaign of 1757 and to his government at Bordeaux in 1758;&nbsp;and at twenty-five he was sent to St Petersburg as secretary&nbsp;of legation. Here he actually saw the revolution which seated</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Catherine II. on the throne, and thus obtained the facts of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anecdotes sur la révolution de Russie en 1762.</span><span class="font0"> Catherine made&nbsp;repeated efforts to secure the destruction of the MS., which&nbsp;remained unpublished until after the empress’s death. Rul-hière became secretary to the comte de Provence (afterwards&nbsp;Louis XVIII.) in 1773, and he was admitted to the Academy&nbsp;in 1787. The later years of his life were spent chiefly in Paris,&nbsp;where he held an appointment in the Foreign Office and went&nbsp;much into society; but he visited Germany and Poland in&nbsp;1776. His unfinished </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de F anarchie de Pologne</span><span class="font0"> (4 vols.,&nbsp;1807) was published posthumously under the editorship of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">P. C. F. Daunou. The only important historical work which&nbsp;he published during his lifetime was his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Éclaircissements historiques sur les causes de la révocation de ledit de Nantes , . .&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(2 vols., 1788), undertaken in view of the restoration to the&nbsp;Protestants of their civil rights. Rulhière died at Bondy on&nbsp;the 30th of January 1791.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His short sketch of the Russian revolution is justly ranked among the masterpieces of the kind in French. Of the larger&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poland</span><span class="font0"> Carlyle, as justly, complains that its allowance of fact&nbsp;is too small in proportion to its bulk. The author was also&nbsp;a fertile writer of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vers de société,</span><span class="font0"> short satires, epigrams, &amp;c.,&nbsp;and he had a considerable reputation among the witty and&nbsp;ill-natured group also containing Nicolas Chamfort, Antoine&nbsp;de Rivarol, Louis René de Champcenetz, &amp;c. On the other&nbsp;hand he has the credit of caring for J. J. Rousseau in his morose&nbsp;old age, until Rousseau as usual quarrelled with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rulhiêre’s works were edited, with a notice by P. R. Anguis, in 1819 (Paris, 6 vols. 8vo).

<p><span class="font0">RULLUS/ PUBLIUS SERVILIUS, Roman tribune of the people^ in 64 b.c., well known as the proposer of one of the&nbsp;most far-reaching agrarian laws brought forward in Roman&nbsp;history. This law provided for the establishment of a commission of ten, empowered to purchase land in Italy for distribution amongst the poorer citizens and for the foundation&nbsp;of colonies. Its professed object was to clear Rome of the&nbsp;large number of pauper citizens, who formed a standing menace&nbsp;to peace. The members of the commission were to be invested&nbsp;with powers so extensive that Cicero spoke of them as ten&nbsp;“ kings.” They were to be elected for five years by seventeen&nbsp;of the tribes chosen by lot from the thirty-five; the imperium&nbsp;was to be conferred upon them by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex curiata,</span><span class="font0"> together&nbsp;with judicial powers and the rank of praetor. Only those&nbsp;were eligible who personally gave in their names, a clause&nbsp;obviously intended to exclude Pompey, who was at the time&nbsp;absent in the East. In fact, the commission as a whole was&nbsp;intended to act as a counterpoise to his power. The only land&nbsp;available for the purposes of the bill was the Ager Campanus&nbsp;and the Ager Stellatis, where 5000 citizens were to be settled&nbsp;at once, but as these were utterly insufficient, other lands&nbsp;were to be acquired by purchase. The necessary money was&nbsp;to be found by the sale of all the public property in Italy which&nbsp;had been ordered to be sold by resolutions of the senate (in&nbsp;81, or subsequently), but which the fear of unpopularity had&nbsp;deterred the consuls from selling; by the sale of lands, &amp;c.,&nbsp;in the provinces which had become public property since 88,&nbsp;and even of the domains acquired during the Mithradatic&nbsp;war. A special article, the object of which was to pacify&nbsp;those who had received grants of land from Sulla, declared&nbsp;such possessions to be private property, for which compensation was to be paid in case of surrender. The revenues of the&nbsp;provinces which were now being organized by Pompey, and&nbsp;the booty and money taken or received by generals during&nbsp;war were also to be applied to this purpose. The places to&nbsp;which colonies were to be sent were not specified (with the&nbsp;exception mentioned above), so that the commissioners would&nbsp;be able to sell wherever they pleased, and it was left to them&nbsp;to decide what was public or private property.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
