Not only by stratagems and sudden surprises, but in regular pitched battles, he succeeded in foiling the most valiant officers of the Roman legions. For above eleven years he bade defiance to the formidable hosts of the invader. To subdue him by force of arms was found impossible, and the base spirit of Q. Servilius Cæpio had recourse to treachery. The offer of a magnificent recompense stimulated three of the followers of Viriathus to assassinate him, which bloody deed they accomplished whilst he lay asleep. It is some consolation to record, that the murderers were disappointed of their reward, and dismissed from the Roman camp with insults and contempt. The indomitable spirit of independence which animated the Spaniards was not, how ever, broken by the death of their great leader. The Nu mantians, in particular, still remained fiercely hostile to the Romans, and the destruction of Numantia was decreed by the senate. Scipio Æmilianus, the conqueror of Carthage, was appointed to the command of the legions destined for this service, and the city was closely invested by a powerful army. While food was left to the besieged, they defied all the efforts of the Romans to take their city. Famine however humbled them into submission, and they sued for mercy, but in vain. Driven to desperation, the wretched remains of the defenders issued from the gates, and fell with fury upon the Roman intrenchments ; but they were forced back within the walls. Æmilianus had formed the cruel resolution of starving them into an unconditional surrender. Rather than yield to this, the Numantians determined, in imitation of the Saguntines, to make a sacrifice of them selves, and of all that was valuable which they possessed. This resolution they carried into effect under circumstances even more shocking than those which accompanied the de struction of Saguntum. When the victor entered the city, not a human being remained alive to grace his triumph ; nothing met his eyes but smouldering ruins and a horrible solitude. This event took place in the year 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi></p><p>After the destruction of Numantia, three fourths of the Peninsula submitted to Rome ; and nothing very remarkable occurs in its history till the time of the civil war between Marius and Sylla. The latter having crushed the Marian faction, proscribed those who had taken a part in it, whom he could not immediately destroy. Among these was Ser torius, who had previously served in Spain as a tribune ; a man of great bodily and mental endowments, of consummate valour, and experience in the art of war, but whose ambition was equal to his nobler gifts. Having es caped to Spain, he there succeeded in gaining over to his interest several of the native tribes, raised a considerable army, and routed the Roman legions in repeated engage ments. He introduced a strict order of discipline among his troops, founded public schools, constituted a senate in imitation of that of Rome, and attempted to establish in Spain a rival sovereignty to that of Italy. But, in the midst of these brilliant though ambitious undertakings, Sertorius was basely assassinated by his subaltern Perpenna, in the year 73 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> With the death of this great captain expired the last faint glimmer of national independence. Pompey, and afterwards Julius Cæsar, reduced most of the native tribes to subjection. After the fall of Pompey in Africa, his eldest son selected Spain as the fittest scene for opposing the dreaded dictator. For the fourth time, Cæsar hastened to the Peninsula, and, on the plains of Munda, gained a bloody but decisive victory over the younger Pompey, who was slain in attempting to effect his escape from the country. Augustus, ' the successor of Cæsar, effectually secured the dominion of Rome over Spain, hav mg reduced the Asturians, Galicians, and Cantabrians, the bravest and most warlike of the native tribes. Spain</p><p>now began to rest from the continual wars with which it had been devastated from the period of the Carthaginian conquest, and quietly submitted to the domination of Rome, from which it received its religion, its laws, its manners, and its language.</p><p>It has already been noticed that the country was at first divided into two provinces, Citerior and Ulterior, between which flowed the Ebro as the natural boundary. With the advance of the Romans the size of the provinces increased, but it is impossible to define their exact limits before the time of Augustus. This emperor, less desirous of effecting new conquests than of securing the old, made arrangements for improving the condition of the whole peninsula. Out of the two provinces he formed three, and gave them the names of Tarraco, Lusitania, and Bætica. Under the pretext of saving time and trouble to the senate, but really for the purpose of retaining power over the whole army in his own hands, he undertook the management of two of the provinces, in which, on account of the pretended inse curity of their situation, a considerable number of troops was maintained. Only Bætica came under the direct control of the senate. A proconsul, who had his seat at Hispalis, was installed governor of this province, but without any military power ; whilst in the imperial provinces, a legatus Augustalis in Emerita, and a legatus proconsularis in Tarraco, exercised complete civil and military autho rity. Subsequently the province conceded to the senate fell entirely under the sway of the emperor, when the go vernor received the name of præses or president. The districts being very extensive, it was found necessary to ap point inferior officers ; under the legate of Lusitania was placed a vicelegatus militaris, and there were three placed under the consular legates of Tarraco. A legate and a quæstor were subject to the proconsul of Bætica. In this manner the country as a whole was divided. Let us now take a glance of the constitution and condition of the towns.</p><p>After the complete subjugation of the Peninsula, the co horts, composed principally of the natives of the country, were transplanted to the most distant parts of the empire, while Roman legions were sent into Spain to supply their place. No arrangement could have been made that was better calculated to give a Roman impress to the character of the people, and to their manners, customs, and establishments. In the interior of the country, towns purely Roman sprung up, small tracts of country having been conferred on soldiers as a reward for their services. Thus the town of Leon is indebted for its name and origin to the seventh legion, which settled there ; and in the same manner arose Emerita Augusta (Merida), Pax Julia (Beja), Cæsar Augusta (Saragossa), and many others. Originally, most of the cities managed their own affairs ; but when Caracalla declared all his subjects throughout his vast empire Roman citizens, the constitutions of the cities of Spain were made uniform with those of the other cities of the empire. Rome, the capital, was the great type to which they all conformed. For purposes of general police, and for the superintendence of public works, for tresses, entertainments, and the like, ædiles were appointed in provincial towns, whose office, however, was one more of pomp and honour than emolument. The affairs of the cities were universally administered by a council or curia, the members of which, called <hi rend="italic">decuriones,</hi> were chosen from among the richest and most respectable of the inhabitants. As advocates or defenders of the people, there were the <hi rend="italic">defensores civitatum,</hi> who neither belonged to the body of the decurions nor to the army, but formed rather a sort of check upon these, and resisted the encroachments of power on the rights of the citizens. We pass over a number of other subordinate functionaries, whose duties are either im perfectly known, or, where known, of minor importance.</p><p>All matters not cognizable by the legal tribunals, nor af</p></body></text></TEI>
