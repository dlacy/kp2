He was a posthumous child, his father, a native of Picardy, and controller of town-dues at Boulogne, having married in this same year, at the age of fifty-two. The father was a man of literary tastes, and used to read, like his son, pencil in hand; his copy of the Elzevir edition of Virgil, covered with his notes, was in his son’s possession, and is mentioned by him in one of his poems. Sainte-Beuve’s mother was half English, her father, a mariner of Boulogne, having married an Englishwoman. The little Charles Augustin was brought up by his mother, who never remarried, and an aunt, his father’s sister, who lived with her. They were poor, but the boy, having learnt all he could at his first school at Boulogne, persuaded his mother to send him, when he was near the age of fourteen, to finish his education at Paris. He boarded with a M. Landry, and had for a fellow-boarder and intimate friend Charles Neate, afterwards fellow of Oriel College and member of parliament for the city of Oxford. From Landry’s boarding-house he attended the classes, first of the Collège Charlemagne, and then of the Collège Bourbon, winning the head prize for history at the first, and for Latin verse at the second. In 1823 he began to study medicine, attending lectures on anatomy and physiology and walking the hospitals. But meanwhile a Liberal newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Globe,</hi> was founded in 1827 by Paul François Dubois, one of Sainte-Beuve’s old teachers at the Collège Charlemagne. Dubois called to his aid his former pupil, who, now quitting the study of medicine, contributed historical and literary articles to the <hi rend="italic">Globe,</hi> among them two, which attracted the notice of Goethe, on Victor Hugo’s <hi rend="italic">Odes et ballades.</hi> These articles led to a friendship with Victor Hugo and to Sainte-Beuve’s connexion with the romantic school of poets, a school never entirely suited to his nature. In the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> appeared also his interesting articles on the French poetry of the 16th century, which in 1828 were collected and published,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> <hi rend="italic">Tableau historique et critique de la poésie française au XVI <hi rend="sup">e</hi> siècle</hi> (2nd ed., 1842). </note> and followed by a second volume containing selections from Ronsard. In 1829 he made his first venture as a poet with the <hi rend="italic">Vie, poésies, et pensées de Joseph Delorme.</hi> His own name did not appear; but Joseph Delorme, that “ Werther in the shape of Jacobin and medical student,” as Guizot called him, was the Sainte-Beuve of those days himself. About the same time was founded the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Paris,</hi> and Sainte-Beuve contributed the opening article, with Boileau for its subject. In 1830 came his second volume of poems, the <hi rend="italic">Consolations,</hi> a work on which Sainte-Beuve looked back in later life with a special affection. To himself it marked and expressed, he said, that epoch of his</p><p>life to which he could with most pleasure return, and at which he could like best that others should see him. But the critic in him grew to prevail more and more and pushed out the poet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> Sainte-Beuve was at this time a devoted Catholic and a little later for a very short period a disciple of Lamennais. But he gradually separated from his Catholic friends, and at the same time a coldness grew up between him and Victor Hugo. He became the lover of Madame Hugo, and a definite separation between the former friends ensued in 1834. [ <hi rend="smallcaps">Ed.</hi>] </note> In 1831 the <hi rend="italic">Revue des deux mondes</hi> was founded in rivalry with the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Paris,</hi> and from the first Sainte-Beuve was one of the most active and important contributors. He brought out his novel of <hi rend="italic">Volupté</hi> in 1834, his third and last volume of poetry, the <hi rend="italic">Pensées d'août,</hi> in 1837. He himself thought that the activity which he had in the meanwhile exercised as a critic, and the offence which in some quarters his criticism had given, were the cause of the less favourable reception which this volume received. He had long meditated a book on Port-Royal. At the end of 1837 he quitted France, accepting an invitation from the academy of Lausanne, where in a series of lectures his work on Port-Royal came into its first form of being. In the summer of the next year he returned to Paris to revise and give the final shape to his work, which, however, was not completed for twenty years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> <hi rend="italic">Port-Royal</hi> (1840-1848, 5 vols.; 3rd and revised ed., 1866; 5th ed. with index, 1888-1891). </note> In 1840 Victor Cousin, then minister of public instruction, appointed him one of the keepers of the Mazarin Library, an appointment which gave him rooms at the library, and, with the money earned by his pen, made him for the first time in his life easy in his circumstances, so that, as he afterwards used to say, he had to buy rare books in order to spend his income. A more important consequence of his easier circumstances was that he could study freely and largely. He returned to Greek, of which a French schoolboy brings from his <hi rend="italic">lycée</hi> no great store. With a Greek teacher, M. Pantasides, he read and re-read the poets in the original, and thus acquired, not, perhaps, a philological scholar’s knowledge of them, but a genuine and invaluable acquaintance with them as literature. His activity in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des deux mondes</hi> continued, and articles on Homer, Theocritus, Apollonius of Rhodes, and Meleager were fruits of his new Greek studies. He wrote also a very good article in 1844 on the Italian poet Leopardi; but in general his subjects were taken from the great literature which he knew best, that of his own country—its literature both in the past and in the contemporary present. Seven volumes of <hi rend="italic">Portraits,</hi> contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Paris</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Revue des deux mondes,</hi> exhibit his work in the years from 1832 to 1848, a work constantly increasing in range and value.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> He was a friend of Madame Récamier, at whose house he met Chateaubriand. He became an especially close friend of Louis Mathieu, Comte Molé, for whose niece, Mme d’Arbouville, he conceived a lasting attachment. [ <hi rend="smallcaps">Ed.</hi>] </note> In 1844 he was elected to the French Academy as successor to Casimir Delavigne, and was received there at the beginning of 1845 by Victor Hugo.</p><p>From this settled and prosperous condition the revolution of February 1848 dislodged him. In March of that year was published an account of secret-service money distributed in the late reign, and Sainte-Beuve was put down as having received the sum of one hundred francs. The smallness of the sum would hardly seem to suggest corruption; it appears probable that the money was given to cure a smoky chimney in his room at the Mazarin Library, and was wrongly entered as secret-service money. But Sainte-Beuve, who piqued himself on his independence and on a punctilious delicacy in money matters, was indignant at the entry, and thought the proceedings of the minister of public instruction and his officials, when he demanded to have the matter sifted, tardy and equivocal. He resigned his post at the Mazarin and accepted an offer from the Belgian government of a chair of French literature in the university of Liége. There he gave the series of lectures on Chateaubriand and his contemporaries which was afterwards (in 1860) published in two volumes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5"> <hi rend="italic">Chateaubriand et son groupe littéraire sous l'Empire.</hi> </note> He liked Liége, and the Belgians would have been glad to keep him; but the attraction of Paris carried</p><pb xml:id="eb11-23-s01-1023" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_1086.jp2"/><p>The work of Sainte-Beuve divides itself into three portions—hispoetry, his criticism before 1848 and his criticism after that year. His novel of <hi rend="italic">Volupté</hi> may properly go with his poetry.</p><p>We have seen his tender feeling for his poetry, and he always maintained that, when the “ integrating molecule,” the foundation of him as a man of letters, was reached, it would be found to have a poetic character. And yet he declares, too, that it is never without a sort of surprise and confusion that he sees his verses detached from their context and quoted in public and in open day. They do not seem made for it, he says. Thia admirable critic knew, indeed, the radical inadequacy of French poetry. It is to English poetry that he resorts in order to find his term of comparison, and to award the praise which to French poetry he refuses. “ Since you are fond of the poets,” he writes to a friend, "I should like to see you read and look for poets in another language, in English for instance. There you will find the most rich, the most dulcet and the most new poetical literature. Our French poets are too soon read; they are too slight, too mixed, too corrupted for the most part, too poor in ideas even when they have the talent for strophe and line, to hold and occupy for long a serious mind ”</p><p>But, even as French poetry, Sainte-Beuve’s poetry had faults of its own. Critics who found much in it to praise yet pronounced it a poetry "narrow, puny and stifled,” and its style “ slowly dragging and laborious." Here we touch on a want which must no doubt be recognized in him, which he recognized in himself, and whereby he is separated from the spirits who succeed in uttering their most highly inspired note and in giving their full measure—some want of flame, of breath, of pinion. Perhaps we may look for the cause in a confession of his own: "I have my weaknesses; they are those which gave to King Solomon his disgust with everything and his satiety with life. I may have regretted sometimes that I was thus extinguishing my fire, but I did not ever pervert my heart.” It is enough for us to take his confession that he extinguished or im-paired his fire.</p><p>Yet his poetry is characterized by merits which make it readable still and readable by foreigners. So far as it exhibits the endeavour of the romantic school in France to enlarge the vocabulary of poetry and to give greater freedom and variety to the alexandrine, it has interest chiefly for readers of his own nation. But it exhibits more than this. It exhibits already the genuine Sainte-Beuve, the author who, as M. Duvergier de Hauranne said in the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> at the time, “ sent à sa manière, écrit comme il sent,” the man who, even in the forms of an artificial poetry, remains always “ un penseur et un homme d’esprit.” That his Joseph Delorme was not the Werther of romance, but a Werther in the shape of Jacobin and medical student, the only Werther whom Sainte-Beuve by his own practical experience really knew, was a novelty in French poetical literature, but was entirely characteristic of Sainte-Beuve. All his poetry has this stamp of direct dealing with common things, of plain unpretending reality and sincerity; and this stamp at that time made it, as Béranger said, “ a kind of poetry absolutely new in France.”</p><p>It has been the fashion to disparage the criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Critiques et portraits littéraires,</hi> the criticism anterior to 1848, and to sacrifice it, in fact, to the criticism posterior to that date. Sainte-Beuve has himself indicated what considerations ought to be present with us in reading the <hi rend="italic">Critiques et portraits,</hi> with what reserves we should read them. They arc to be considered, he says, “ rather as a dependency of the elegiac and romanesque part of my work than as express criticisms.” They have the copiousness and enthusiasm of youth; they have also its exuberance. He judged in later life Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Victor Hugo more coolly, judged them differently. But the <hi rend="italic">Critiques et portraits</hi> contain a number of articles on personages, other than contemporary French poets and romance-writers, which have much of the soundness of his later work, and, in addition, an abundance and fervour of their own which arc not without their attraction. Many of these are delightful reading. The articles on the Greek poets and on Leopardi have been already mentioned. Those on Boileau, Molière, Pierre Daunou and Charles Claude Fauriel, on Madame de la Fayette and Mademoiselle Aïssé may be taken as samples of a whole group which will be found to support perfectly the test of reading, even after we have accustomed ourselves to the later work of the master. Nay, his soberness and tact show themselves even in this earlier stage of his criticism, and even in treating the objects of his too fervid youthful enthusiasm. A special object of this was Victor Hugo, and in the first article on him in the <hi rend="italic">Portraits contemporains</hi> we have certainly plenty of enthusiasm, plenty of exuberance. We have the epithets “ adorable,” “ sublime," “supreme,” given to Victor Hugo’s poetry; we arc told of <hi rend="italic">“</hi> the majesty of its high and sombre philosophy.” But the article next</p><pb xml:id="eb11-23-s01-1024" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_1087.jp2"/><p>following this, and written only four years later, in 1835, is the article of a critic, and takes the points of objection, seizes the weak side of Victor Hugo's poetry, how much it has of what is “ creux,” “sonore,” “artificiel" “voulu,” “théâtral,” “violent,” as distinctly as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Causeries</hi> could seize it. “ The Frank, energetic and subtle, who has mastered to perfection the technical and rhetorical resources of the Latin literature of the decadence,” is a description never to be forgotten of Victor Hugo as a poet, and Sainte-Beuve launches it in this article, written when he was but thirty years old, and still a painter of “ portraits de jeunesse ” only.</p><p>He had thus been steadily working and growing; nevertheless, 1848 is an epoch which divides two critics in him of very unequal value. When, after that year of revolution and his stage of seclusion and labour at Liége, he came back to Paris in the autumn of 1849 and commenced in the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Causeries du lundi</hi> he was astonishingly matured. Something of fervour, enthusiasm, poetry, he may have lost, but he had become a perfect critic—a critic of measure, not exuberant; of the centre, not provincial; of keen industry and curiosity, with “ Truth ” (the word engraved in English on his seal) for his motto; moreover, with gay and amiable temper, his manner as good as his matter—the "critique souriant,” as, in Charles Monselet’s dedication to him, he is called.</p><p>The root of everything in his criticism is his single-hearted devotion to truth. What he called “ fictions ” in literature, in politics, in religion, were not allowed to influence him. Some one had talked on his being tenacious of a certain set of literary opinions. “ I hold very little,” he answers, “to literary opinions; literary opinions occupy very little place in my life and in my thoughts. What does occupy me seriously is life itself and the object of it.” “ I am accustomed incessantly to call my judgments in question anew, and to re-cast my opinions the moment I suspect them to be without validity.” “ What I have wished ” (in <hi rend="italic">Port-Royal) "</hi> is to say not a word more than I thought, to stop even a little short of what I believed in certain cases, in order that my words might acquire more weight as historical testimony.” To all exaggeration and untruth, from whatever side it proceeded, he had an antipathy. “ I turn my back upon the Michelets and Quinets, but I cannot hold out my hand to the Veuillots.”</p><p>But Sainte-Beuve could not have been the great critic he was had he not had, at the service of this his love of truth and measure, the conscientious industry of a Benedictine. “ I never have a holiday. On Monday towards noon I lift up my head, and breathe for about an hour; after that the wicket shuts again and I am in my prison cell for seven days.” The <hi rend="italic">Causeries</hi> were at this price. They came once a week, and to write one of them as he wrote it was indeed a week's work. The “ irresponsible indolent reviewer ” should read his notes to his friend and provider with books, M. Paul Chéron of the National Library. Here is a note dated the 2nd of January 1853: "Good-day and a happy New Year. To-day I set to work on Grimm. A little dry; but after St François de Sales ” (his Monday article just finished) “ one requires a little relief from roses. I have of Grimm the edition of his <hi rend="italic">Correspondance</hi> by M. Taschereau. I have also the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of Madame d’Épinay, where there are many letters of his. But it is possible that there may be <hi rend="italic">notices</hi> of him mentioned in the bibliographical book of that German whose name I have forgotten. I should like, too, to have the <hi rend="italic">first editions</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">Correspondance</hi>; they came out in successive parts.” Thus he prepared himself, not for a grand review article once a quarter, but for a newspaper review once a week.</p><p>His adhesion to the empire caused him to be represented by the Orleanists and Republicans as without character and patriotism, and to be charged with baseness and corruption. The Orleanists had, in a great degree, possession of the higher press in France and of English opinion—of Liberal English opinion more especially. And with English Liberals his indifference to parliamentary government was indeed a grievous fault in him; “you Whigs,” as Croker happily says, “are like quack doctors, who have but one specific for all constitutions.” To him either the doctrine of English Liberals, or the doctrine of Republicanism, applied absolutely, was what he called a “ fiction,” one of those fictions which “ always end by obscuring the truth.” Not even on M. de Tocqueville’s authority would he consent to receive “ les hypothèses dites les plus honorables ”—“ the suppositions which nass for the most respectable.” AH suppositions he demanded to sift, to see them at work, to know the place and time and men to which they were to be applied. For the France before his eyes in 1849 he thought that something “ solid and stable ”— <hi rend="italic">un mur,</hi> “ a wall,” as he said—was requisite, and that the government of Louis Napoleon supplied this walk But no one judged the empire more independently than he did, no one saw and enounced its faults more clearly ; he described himself as being, in his own single person, “ the <hi rend="italic">gauche</hi> of the empire,” and the description was just.</p><p>To these merits of mental independence, industry, measure, lucidity, his criticism adds the merit of happy temper and disposition. Goethe long ago noticed that, whereas Germans reviewed one another as enemies whom they hated, the critics of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> reviewed one another as gentlemen. This arose from the higher social development of France and from the closer relations of literature with life there. But Sainte-Beuve has more, as a critic, than the external politeness which once at any rate distinguished his countrymen: he has a personal charm of manner due to a sweet and humane temper. He complained of <hi rend="italic">un peu de dureté,</hi> “ a certain dose of hardness,” in the new generation of writers. The personality of an author had a peculiar importance for him; the poetical side of his subjects, however latent it might be, always attracted him, and he always sought to extricate it. This was because he had the moderate, gracious, amiably <hi rend="italic">human</hi> instincts of the true poetic nature. “ Let me beg of you, he says in thanking a reviewer who praised him, “ to alter one or two expressions at any rate. I cannot bear to have it said that I am the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> in anything whatever, as a writer least of all; it is not a thing which can be admitted, and these ways of classing people give offence.” Literary man and loyal to the French Academy as he was, he can yet write to an old friend after his election: “ All these academies, between you and me, are pieces of childishness; at any rate the French Academy is. Our least quarter of an hour of solitary reverie or of serious talk, yours and mine, in our youth, was better employed; but, as one gets old, one falls back into the power of these nothings; only it is well to know that nothings they are.”</p><p>Perhaps the best way to get a sense of the value and extent of the work done in the last twenty years of his life by the critic thus excellently endowed is to take a single volume of the <hi rend="italic">causeries du lundi,</hi> to look through its list of subjects, and to remember that with the qualities above mentioned all these subjects are treated. Any volume will serve; let us take the fourth. This volume con-sists of articles on twenty-four subjects. Twenty of these are the following: Mirabeau and Sophie, Montaigne, Mirabeau and Comte de la. Marck, Mademoiselle de Scudéry, André Chénier as politician, Saint-Évremond and Ninon, Joseph de Maistre, Madame de Lambert, Madame Necker, the Abbé Maury, the Duc de Lauzun of Louis XVI.'s reign, Marie Antoinette, Buffon, Madame de Maintenon, De Bonald Amyot, Mallet du Pan, Marmontel, Chamfort, Rulhière. Almost every personage is French, it is true; Sainte-Beuve had a maxim that the critic should prefer subjects which he possesses familiarly. The great place of France in the world is very much due to her eminent gift for social life and development ; and this gift French literature has accompanied, fashioned, perfected, and continues to reflect And nowhere shall we find such interest more completely and charmingly brought out than in Sainte-Beuve’s <hi rend="italic">Causeries du lundi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux lundis.</hi> As a guide to bring us to a knowledge of the French genius and literature he is unrivalled.</p><p>(M.
