<p><span class="font2">As regards the John mentioned in the Apocalypse, he is now identified by a majority of critics with John the Presbyter,&nbsp;and further the trend of criticism is in favour of transferring&nbsp;all the Johannine writings to him, or rather to his school in&nbsp;Asia Minor.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REVELS, MASTER OF THE.@@<sup>3</sup>—The history of the Revels office has an interesting place in that of the English stage (see&nbsp;also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Drama,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theatre).</span><span class="font2"> Among the expenses of the royal&nbsp;Wardrobe we find provision made for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tunicae</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis er es</span><span class="font2"> in&nbsp;1347 for the Christmas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ludi</span><span class="font2"> of Edward III.; during the reign&nbsp;of Henry VII. payments are also recorded for various forms of&nbsp;court revels; and it became regular, apparently, to appoint a&nbsp;special functionary, called Master of the Revels, to superintend&nbsp;the royal festivities, quite distinct from the Lord of Misrule </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In Henry VII.’s time he seems to have been a minor official of the&nbsp;household. In Henry VIII.’s time, however, the post became&nbsp;more important, and an officer of the Wardrobe was permanently&nbsp;employed to act under the Master of the Revels. With the&nbsp;patent given to John Farlyon in 1534 as Yeoman of the Revels,&nbsp;what may be considered as an independent office of the Revels&nbsp;(within the general sphere of the lord chamberlain) came into&nbsp;being; and in 1544 Sir Thomas Cawarden received a patent&nbsp;as Master of the Revels, he being the first to become head of&nbsp;an independent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">office, Magister Jocorum, Revelorum et Mascorum&nbsp;omnium et Singularium nostrorum Vulgariter nuncupatorum&nbsp;Revells and Masks.</span><span class="font2"> Cawarden was Master till 1559. Soon after&nbsp;his appointment, the office and its stores were transferred to a&nbsp;dissolved Dominican monastery at Blackfriars, having previously&nbsp;been housed at Warwick Inn in the city, the Charterhouse, and&nbsp;then at the priory of St John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell, to&nbsp;which a return was made after Cawarden’s death. Sir Thomas&nbsp;Benger succeeded Cawarden, and Edmund Tylney followed him&nbsp;(1579-1610); it was the appointment of the latter’s nephew,&nbsp;Sir George Buck, as deputy-master, with the reversion to the&nbsp;mastership, which led to so much repining on the part of the&nbsp;dramatist, John Lyly, who was himself a candidate. Under&nbsp;Tylney, the functions of Master of the Revels graduaUy&nbsp;became extended to a general censorship of the stage,&nbsp;which in 1624 was put directly in the hands of the lord&nbsp;chamberIain, thus leading to the licensing act of 1737 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Drama).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup>There are several analogies in Jewish literature. Thus the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs—</span><span class="font1">a universalist work—and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Jubilees—</span><span class="font1">a particularistic work—are from different authors,&nbsp;though they are written within a few years of each other by Pharisees and use much common material. Similarly with regard to&nbsp;the Apocalypse of Baruch and 4 Ezra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup>Several converging lines of testimony tend to prove that John the son of Zebedee was, like his brother James, put to death by the&nbsp;Jews. First, we have the express testimony of Papias to this&nbsp;effect, which is preserved in George Hamartofus and in an epitome&nbsp;of Philip of Side. Attempts have been made to explain away&nbsp;this testimony by Lightfoot, Harnack, Drummond, and Bernard&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Irish Church Quarterly,</span><span class="font1"> 1908, 52 sqq.). Secondly, Papias’s testimony receives support from Jesus’s own words in Mark x. 39;&nbsp;for, as WelIhausen remarks on this passage, &quot; the prophecy refers&nbsp;not only to James but also to John; and if it had remained only&nbsp;half fulfilled, it would hardly have kept its place in the Gospel.”&nbsp;The third strand of evidence is found in the Martyrologies, Carthaginian, Armenian and Syrian. Bernard </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.)</span><span class="font1"> has tried to&nbsp;prove that the MartyroIogies do not imply the martyrdom but&nbsp;only the faithful witness of John. Finally, Clement of Alexandria&nbsp;(Bousset, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Offenbarung,</span><span class="font1"> p. 38) furnishes evidence in the same&nbsp;direction; for in Clem. Alex. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Strom,</span><span class="font1"> iv. 9, 71, the Gnostic Herac-Ieon gives* a list of the Apostks who had not been martyred, and&nbsp;these were: &quot; Matthew, Philip, Thomas and Levi” (corrupt for&nbsp;Lebbaeus). If we accept this evidence, the martyrdom, cannot&nbsp;have been later than a.d. 69, and may have been considerably&nbsp;earlier. . In either case such a fact, if it is a fact, is against an&nbsp;Apostolic origin of the Johannine writings. John the Presbyter&nbsp;is in that case &quot; the disciple whom Jesus loved ” and the founder of&nbsp;the Johannine school in Asia Minor. But the question is still at&nbsp;issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> The word &quot; revel ” meant properly a noisy or riotous tumult or merry-making, and is derived from O. Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reveler,</span><span class="font1"> to rebel, to riot,&nbsp;make a noise; Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rebellare.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font2">REVENTLOW, CHRISTIAN DITLEV FREDERICK, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count </span><span class="font2">(1748-1827), Danish statesman and reformer, the son of Privy&nbsp;Councillor Christian Ditlev Reventlow, born on March ir, 1748.&nbsp;After being educated at the academy of Sorö and at Leipzig,&nbsp;Reventlow, in company with his younger brother Johan Ludwig&nbsp;and the distinguished Saxon economist Carl Wendt (1731-1815),&nbsp;the best of cicerones on such a tour, travelled through Germany,&nbsp;Switzerland, France and EngIand, to examine the social, economical and agricultural conditions of civilized Europe. A&nbsp;visit to Sweden and Norway to study mining and metallurgy&nbsp;completed the curriculum, and when Reventlow in the course&nbsp;of 1770 returned to Denmark he was an authority on all the&nbsp;economic questions of the day. In 1774 he held a high&nbsp;position in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kammerkollegiet,</span><span class="font2"> or board of trade, two years&nbsp;later he entered the Department of Mines, and in 1781 he was a&nbsp;member of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Overskattedirectionen,</span><span class="font2"> or chief taxing board. He&nbsp;had, in 1774, married Frederica Charlotte von Beulwitz, who&nbsp;bore him thirteen children, and on his father’s death in 1775&nbsp;inherited the family estate in Laaland. Reventlow overflowed&nbsp;with progressive ideas, especially as regards agriculture, and he&nbsp;devoted himself, heart and soul, to the improvement of his&nbsp;property and the amelioration of his serfs. Fortunately, the&nbsp;ambition to play a useful part in a wider field of activity than he&nbsp;could find in the country ultimately prevailed. His time came&nbsp;when the ultra-conservative ministry of Hoegh Guldberg was&nbsp;dismissed (April 14th, 1784) and Andreas Bernstorff, the statesman for whom Reventlow had the highest admiration, returned&nbsp;to power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reventlow was an excellently trained specialist in many departments, and was aIways firm and confident in those&nbsp;subjects which he had made his own. Moreover, he was a man&nbsp;of strong and warm feelings, and deeply religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The condition of the peasantry especially interested him. He was convinced that free labour would be far more profitable&nbsp;to the land, and that the peasant himself would be better if&nbsp;released from his thraldom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His favourite field of labour was thrown open to him when, on the 6th of August 1784, he was placed at the head of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rente-kammeret,</span><span class="font2"> which took cognisance of everything relating to&nbsp;agriculture. His first step was to appoint a small agricultural&nbsp;commission to better the condition of the crown serfs, and&nbsp;amongst other things enable them to turn their leaseholds into&nbsp;freehoIds. Observing that the Crown Prince Frederick was also&nbsp;favourably disposed towards the amelioration of the peasantry,&nbsp;Reventlow induced him, in July 1786, to appoint a grand&nbsp;commission to take the condition of all the peasantry in the&nbsp;kingdom into immediate consideration. This celebrated&nbsp;agricuItural commission continued its labours for many years,&nbsp;and introduced a whole series of reforms of the highest importance. Thus the ordinance of 8th June 1787 modified&nbsp;the existing leaseholds, greatly to the advantage of the&nbsp;peasantry; the ordinance of 20th June 1788 abolished&nbsp;Villenage and completely transformed the much-abused </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hoveri&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">system whereby the feudal tenant was bound to cultivate his&nbsp;lord’s land as well q.s his own; and the ordinance of 6th December&nbsp;1799, which did away with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hoveri</span><span class="font2"> altogether. Reventlow&nbsp;was also instrumental in starting the public credit banks, for&nbsp;enabling small cultivators to borrow money on favourable&nbsp;terms. In conjunction with his friend, Heinrich Ernst Schimmelmann (1747-1831), he also procured the passing of the&nbsp;ordinances permitting free trade between Denmark and Norway,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
