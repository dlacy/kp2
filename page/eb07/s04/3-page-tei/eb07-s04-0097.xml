Spinoza has generally been considered as the author of a tract entitled “ Lucii Antistii Constantis de Jure Ecclesiasticorum liber singularis.” Alethopoli, 1666, 8vo. It has also been ascribed to Meyer, his friend and physician ; but Leibnitz believed the author to have been Van den Hoof, who wrote “ L'Intérêt de la Hollande,” and various other works.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>SPIRAL, in <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi> a curved line of the circular kind, which in its progress recedes from its centre.</p><p>SPIRE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Speyer,</hi> a city of Bavaria, in the province of the Rhine, the capital of a canton of the same name. It contains no less than fifteen Catholic and two Lutheran churches, though not more than 740 houses with 3900 in habitants, having greatly declined from its former extent and celebrity. Here the reformers of Germany, in 1529, entered a protest against the proceedings of the Diet, and thus obtained the name of Protestants. Lat. 49. 18.51. Long. 8. 31. 13. E.

It is in the canton of the Grisons, and in the bailiwick of Schams. It contains a good hotel, which is also the post house, where relays of horses are always to be procured. It is 5928 feet above the level of the sea, and is surrounded with mountains of which the summits are perpetually' covered with snow. The descent from this spot, on both sides, excites the admiration of all travellers. To the south the road has been formed by the Austrian government. It is carried in traverses along the front of the rocky precipices, is of great breadth, with a very gradual descent ; and in several parts there are long galleries, covered with bomb proof arches, to prevent the road from being choaked by avalanches, or by the enormous masses of rocks that some times are liable to fall from the lofty summits. The road that descends on the northern side has been formed by the canton of the Grisons, and is tolerably good, but is not equal to the Austrian portion. The descent to Andeer is made with neither risk nor difficulty, and at that village, where there is a good hotel and posthouse, the most picturesque scenery commences. This road leads to Tussis, through what from antiquity has received the name of the <hi rend="italic">Via mala. </hi>It follows the course of the Rhine, sometimes far above it, sometimes close to its gulf, and frequently passing over it by strongly built bridges. It has two arched passages, cut with vast labour out of the solid rock. Splugen is sixteen miles from Chiavinna, in the Austrian territory ; and twenty from Tussis, in the canton of the Grisons.</p><p>SPOILS, whatever is taken from the enemy in time of war.</p><p>Among the ancient Greeks, the spoils were divided among the whole army, only the general’s share was the largest ; but among the Romans, the spoils belonged to the republic.</p><p>SPOLANK, a village on the south coast of Java, near to which are hot mineral springs, which raise Fahrenheit’s thermometer to 122°.

It extends over 1401 square miles, contains six cities, fourteen towns, and 204 villages, with 102,053 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, at the foot of a hill, and on a brook which flows to the Maragia. It is the seat of a bishop, and likewise of the civil tribunals. Besides a cathedral and twenty-two parish churches, it contains twenty-two monasteries, with some hermitages and establishments of brotherhoods of devotion. The streets are narrow and crooked, the houses old and many of them dilapidated ; but the city contains 7000 inhabitants. A magnificent aqueduct sup plies it with water. There are many interesting remains of antiquity, and among others, a triumphal arch of Hanni bal, ruins of a theatre, of a temple of Concord, of Jupiter, and of Mars, and of a palace of Theodoric.

It is fixed, flexible, and very torpid, growing in a variety of forms, com posed either of reticulated fibres, or masses of small spines interwoven together, and clothed with a living gelatinous flesh, full of small mouths or holes on its surface, by which it sucks in and throws out the water. As early as the days of Aristotle, sponges were supposed to possess animal life ; the persons employed in collecting them having observed them shrink when torn from the rocks, thus exhibiting symptoms of sensation. The same opinion prevailed in the time of Pliny; but no attention was paid to this subject till Mar sigli examined them, and declared them vegetables. Dr. Peysonell, in a paper which he sent to the Royal Society in the year 1752, and in a second in 1757, affirmed they were not vegetables, but the production of animals; and he has accordingly described the animals, and the process which they performed in making the sponges Mr. Ellis, in the year 1762, was at great pains to discover these animals. For this purpose he dissected the spongia urens, and was surprised to find a great number of small worms of the genus of nereis or sea scolopendre, which had pierced their way through the soft substance of the sponge in quest of a safe retreat. That this was really the case he was fully assured, by inspecting a number of specimens of the same kind of sponge, just fresh from the sea. He put them into a glass filled with sea water ; and then, instead of seeing any of the little animals which Dr. Peysonell described, he observed the papillæ or small holes with which the papillæ are surrounded contract and dilate themselves. He examined another variety of the same species of sponge, and plainly perceived the small tubes inspire and expire the water. He therefore concluded that the sponge is an animal, and that the ends or openings of the branched tubes are the mouths by which it receives its nourishment, and discharges its excrements.</p><p>SPONSORS are those persons who, in the office of baptism, answer or are sureties for the persons baptized.</p><p>SPONTANEOUS, a term applied to such motions of the body and operations of the mind as we perform of our selves without any constraint.</p><p>SPOONING, in the sea-language, is said of a ship which, being under sail in a storm at sea, is unable to bear it, and consequently forced to go right before the wind.</p><p>SPORADES, among ancient astronomers, a name given to such stars as were not included in any constellation.</p><p>@@@• Leibnitz, Essais de Theodicée, p∙ 371.</p></body></text></TEI>
