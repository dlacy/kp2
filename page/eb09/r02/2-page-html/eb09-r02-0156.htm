<p><span class="font1">In March 1318 first the town and then the castle of Berwick capitulated, and Bruce wasted the English border&nbsp;as far as Ripon. In December he held a parliament at&nbsp;Scone, where he displayed the same wisdom as a legislator&nbsp;which he had shown as a general. The death of his&nbsp;brother and his daughter rendered a resettlement of the&nbsp;crown advisable, which was made in the same order as&nbsp;before, with a provision as to the regency in case of a&nbsp;minor heir in favour of Randolph, and failing him Douglas.&nbsp;The defence of the country was next cared for by regulations for the arming of the whole nation, down to every&nbsp;one who owned the value of a cow,—a measure far in advance of the old feudal levy. Exports during war and of&nbsp;arms at any time were prohibited. Internal justice was&nbsp;regulated, and it was declared that it was to be done to&nbsp;poor and rich alike. Leasing-making—a Scottish term for&nbsp;seditious language—was to be sternly punished. The nobles&nbsp;were exhorted not to oppress the commons. Reforms were&nbsp;also made in the tedious technicalities of the feudal law.&nbsp;In 1319 an attempt to recover Berwick was repelled by&nbsp;Walter the Steward, and Bruce took occasion of a visit to&nbsp;compliment his son-in-law and raise the walls 10 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His position was now so strong that foreign states began to testify their respect. Bruges and Ypres rejected a&nbsp;request of Edward tp cut off the Scottish trade with&nbsp;Flanders. The pope, who had excommunicated Bruce,&nbsp;was addressed by the parliament of Arbroath in 1320 in&nbsp;a letter which compared Bruce to a Joshua or Judas&nbsp;Maccabæus, who had wrought the salvation of his people,&nbsp;and declared they fought “ not for glory, truth, or honour,&nbsp;but for that liberty which no virtuous man will survive.”&nbsp;Moved by this language and conscious of the weakness&nbsp;of Edward, the pope exhorted him to make peace with&nbsp;Scotland, and three years later Randolph at last procured&nbsp;the recognition of Bruce as king from the papal see by&nbsp;promising aid in a crusade. In 1326 the French king&nbsp;made a similar acknowledgment by the treaty of Corbeil.&nbsp;Meantime hostilities more or less constant continued with&nbsp;England, but, though in 1322 Edward made an incursion&nbsp;as far as Edinburgh, the fatal internal weakness of his&nbsp;government prevented his gaining any real success. Some&nbsp;of his chief nobles—Lancaster in 1321 and Sir Andrew&nbsp;Hartcla in 1322—entered into correspondence with the&nbsp;Scots, and, though Hartcla’s treason was detected and&nbsp;punished by his death, Edward was forced to make a&nbsp;treaty for a long truce of thirteen years at Newcastle on&nbsp;30th May, which Bruce ratified at Berwick. The intrigue&nbsp;of the queen with Roger Mortimer led to the end of the&nbsp;ignominious reign by Edward’s deposition and murder in&nbsp;1327 ; and one of the first acts of the new reign, after a&nbsp;narrow escape of the young king from capture by Randolph,&nbsp;was the treaty of York, ratified at Northampton in April&nbsp;1328, by which it was agreed that “Scotland, according&nbsp;to its ancient bounds in the days of Alexander III., should&nbsp;remain to Robert, king of Scots, and his heirs free and&nbsp;divided from England, without any subjection, servitude,&nbsp;claim or demand whatsoever.” Johanna, Edward’s sister,&nbsp;was to be given in marriage to David, the infant son of&nbsp;Bruce, and the ceremony was celebrated at Berwick on&nbsp;12th July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chief author of Scottish independence barely survived his work. His last years had been spent chiefly at the castle&nbsp;of Cardross on the Clyde, which he acquired in 1326, and&nbsp;the conduct of war, as well as the negotiations for peace,&nbsp;had been left to the young leaders Randolph and Douglas,&nbsp;whose training was one of Bruce’s services to his country.&nbsp;Ever active, he employed himself in the narrower sphere&nbsp;of repairing the castle and improving its domains and&nbsp;gardens, in shipbuilding on the Clyde, and in the exercise&nbsp;of the royal virtues of hospitality and charity. The religious feeling, which had not been absent even during the&nbsp;struggles of manhood, deepened in old age, and took the&nbsp;form the piety of the times prescribed. He made careful&nbsp;provision for his funeral, his tomb, and masses for his soul.&nbsp;He procured from the pope a bull authorizing his confessor&nbsp;to absolve him even at the moment of death. He died&nbsp;from leprosy, contracted in the hardships of earlier life, on&nbsp;7th June 1329, and was buried at Dunfermline beside his&nbsp;second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, whom he had married&nbsp;about 1304, and who bore him late his only son, David,&nbsp;who succeeded him. Of two surviving daughters, Matilda&nbsp;married Thomas Ysaak, a simple esquire, and Margaret&nbsp;became the wife of William, earl of Sutherland. Marjory,&nbsp;an only child by his first wife, Isabella of Mar, had predeceased him. Several children not born in wedlock have&nbsp;been traced in the records, but none of them became in&nbsp;any λvay famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fulfilment of a vow to visit the Holy Sepulchre, which he could not accomplish in person, Bruce requested Douglas to carry&nbsp;his heart there, but his faithful follower perished on the way, fighting in Spain against the Moors, and the heart of Bruce, recovered&nbsp;by Sir William Keith, found its resting-place at Melrose. When&nbsp;his corpse was disinterred in 1819 the breast-bone was found severed&nbsp;to admit of the removal of the heart, thus confirming the story preserved in the verses of Barbour. That national poet collected in&nbsp;the earliest Scottish poem, written in the reign of Bruce’s grandson,&nbsp;the copious traditions which clustered round his memory. It is a&nbsp;panegyric ; but history has not refused to accept it as a genuine&nbsp;representation of the character of the great king, in spirit, if not in&nbsp;every detail. Its dominant note is freedom—the liberty of the&nbsp;nation from foreign bondage, and of the individual from oppression.&nbsp;It is the same note which Tacitus embodied in the speech of&nbsp;Galgacus at the dawn of Scottish history. Often as it has been&nbsp;heard before and since in the course of history, seldom has it had&nbsp;a more illustrious champion than Robert the Bruce. (Æ. M.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBERT, Hubert (1753-1808), bornât Paris in 1753, deserves to be remembered not so much for his skill as a&nbsp;painter as for the liveliness and point with which he treated&nbsp;the subjects he painted. The contrast between the ruins&nbsp;of ancient Rome and the life of his time excited his keenest&nbsp;interest ; and, although he had started for Italy on his own&nbsp;responsibility, the credit he there acquired procured him&nbsp;the protection of the minister Marigny and an official&nbsp;allowance. His incessant activity as an artist, his daring&nbsp;character, his many adventures, attracted general sympathy&nbsp;and admiration. In the fourth canto of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">HImagination&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Delille celebrated Robert’s miraculous escape when lost in&nbsp;the catacombs ; later in life, when imprisoned during the&nbsp;Terror and marked for the guillotine, by a fatal accident&nbsp;another died in his place and Robert lived. The quantity&nbsp;of his work is immense ; the Louvre alone contains nine&nbsp;paintings by his hand and specimens are frequently to be&nbsp;met with in provincial museums and private collections.&nbsp;In spite of a certain naturalness in details which was&nbsp;wanting to his predecessor Panini, all Robert’s work has&nbsp;more or less of that scenic character which justified the&nbsp;taste of Voltaire when he selected him to paint the decorations of his theatre at Ferney. Robert fell, struck by&nbsp;apoplexy, on 15th April 1808. His brush was in his hand;&nbsp;he had painted till the last moment. He was much engraved by the abbé Le Non, with whom he had visited&nbsp;Naples in the company of Fragonard during his early days ;&nbsp;in Italy his work has also been frequently reproduced by&nbsp;Châtelain, Liénard, Le Veau, and others.</span></p>
