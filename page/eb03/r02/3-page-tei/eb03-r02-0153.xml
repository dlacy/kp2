Next morning by break of day, Gracchus having aſſembled his friends, led them from his houſe, and poſted one half oi them in the'comitium, while he went up himſelf with the other to the capitol. As ſoon as he appeared, the people ſaluted him with loud acclamations of joy.- But ſcarce was he placed in his tribunal, when Fulvius Flaccus a ſenator, and friend to Gracchus, breaking through the crowd, came up to him, and gave him notice, that the ſenators, who were aſſembled in the temple of Faith, which almoſt touched that of Jupiter Capitolinus, had conſpired againſt his liſe, and were reſolved to attack him openly on his very tribunal. Hereupon Gracchus tucked up his robe, as it were, to prepare for a battle ; and, after his example, ſome of his party, ſeizing the ſtaves of the apparitors, prepared to defend themſelves, and to repel force by force. Theſe preparations terrified the other tribunes ; who immediately abandoned their places in a cowardly manner, and mixed with the crowd ; while the prieſts ran to ſhut the gates of the temple, for fear of its being profaned. On the other hand, the fi iends of Gracchus, who were diſperſed by parties in different places, cried out, <hi rend="italic">11'e are ready : IVhat mu ft we do ?</hi>  Gracchus, whoſe voice could not be heard by all his adherents on account of the tumult, the clamours, and the confuſed cries of the different parties, put his hand to his head ; which was the ſignal agreed on to prepare for battle. But ſome of his enemies, putting a malicious conſtruction upon that geſture, immediately flew to. the ſenate, and told the fathers, that the ſeditious tribune had called for the crown to be put upon his head. Hereupon the ſenators, fancying they already ſaw the king oi Perga-mus’s diadem on the tribune’s head, and the royal mantle on his ſhoulders, reſolved to give the conſul leave to arm his legions, treat the friends of Gracchus as enemies, and turn the comitium into a field of battle.</p><p>But the conſul Mutius Scævola, who was a prudent-and moderate man, refuſed to be the inſtrument of their raſh revenge, and to diſhonour his contulate with the maſſacre of a diſarmed people. As Calpur-r.ius Piſo, the other conſul, was then in Sicily, the moſt turbulent among the ſenators cried out, “ Since one of our conſuls is abſent, and the other betrays the republic, let us do ourſelves juſtice ; let us immediately go and demoliſh with our own bands this idol of the people.” Scipio Naſica, who had been all along ſor violent meaſures, inveighed bitterly againſt the conſul for refuſing to ſuccour the republic in her greateſt diſtreſs. Scipio Naſica was the great grandſon of Cneius Scipio, the uncle of the firſt Africanus, and conſequently couſin to the Gracchi by their mother Cornelia. But nevertheleſs not one of the ſenators betrayed a more irreconcileable hatred againſt the tribune than he. When the prudent conſul refuſed to arm his legions, and put the adherents of Gracchus to death contrary to the uſual forms of juſtice, he ſet no bounds to his fury, but, riſing up from his place, cried out like a madman, “ Since our conſul betrays us, let thoſe who love the republic follow me.” Having uttered theſe words, he immediately walked out of the temple, attended by a great number of ſenators.</p><p>Naſica threw his robe over his ſhoulders, and having covered his head with it, advanced with his followers into the crowd, where he was joined by a company of the clients and friends of the patricians, armed with ſtaves and clubs. Theſe, falling indifferently upon all who ſtood in their way, diſperſed the crowd. Many of Gracchus’s party took to their heels ; and in that tumult all the feats being overturned and broken, Naſica, armed with the leg of a broken bench, knocked down all who oppoſed him, and at length reached Gracchus. One of his party ſeized the tribune by the lappet of his robe : but he, quitting his gown, fled in his tunic ; and as he was in that hurry of ſpirits, which is inſeparabie ſrom ſear, leaping over the broken benches, he had the misfortune to flip and fall. As he was getting up again, he received a blow on the head, which ſtunned him : then his adverſaries ruſhing in upon him, with repeated blows put an end to his life.</p><p>Rome was by his death delivered, according to Cicero, from a domeſtic enemy, who was more formidable to lier than even, that Numantia, which had firſt kindled his reſentments. Perhaps no man was ever born with greater talents, or more capable of aggrandizing himſelf, and doing honour to his country. But his great mind, his manly courage, his lively, eaſy, and powerful eloquence, were, ſays Cicero, like a ſword in the hands of a madman. Gracchus ab uſed them, not in ſupporting an unjuſt cauſe, but in conducting a good one with too much violence. He went ſo far as to make ſome believe that he had really ſomething in view beſides the intereſt of the people whom he pre-· tended to relieve; and therefore ſome hiſtorians have, repreſented him as a tyrant. But the moſt judicious, writers clear him from this imputation, and aſeribe his firſt deſign of reviving, the Licinian law to an eager deſire of being revenged on the ſenators for the affront they had very unjuſtly put upon him, and the conſul Mancinus, as we have hinted above. The law he attempted to revive had an air of juſtice, which gave a fonction to his revenge, without calling any blemiſh on his reputation.</p><p>The death of Gracchus did not pul an end to the tumult. Above 300 of the tribune’s friends loſt their lives in the fray ; and their bodies were thrown, with that of Gracchus, into the Tiber. Nay, the ſenate carried their revenge beyond the fatal day which had ſtained the Capitol with Roman blood. They ſought for all the friends of the late tribune, and without any form of law aſſaſſinated ſome, and forced others into, baniſhment. Caius Billiua, one of the moſt zealous defenders of the people, was ſeized by his enemies, and ſhut up in a caſk with ſnakes and vipers, where he mi-ſerably periſhed. Though the laws prohibited any citizen to take away the life of another before he had been legally condemned, Naſica and his followers were acquitted by the ſenate, who enacted a decree, juſtify-ing all the cruelties committed againſt Gracchus and his adherents.</p><p>Theſe diſturbances were for a ſhort time interrupted by a revolt of the ſlaves in Sicily, occaſioned by the cruelty of their maſters ; but they being ſoon reduced, the conteſts about the <hi rend="italic">Sempronian law,</hi>  as it was called, again took place. Both parties were determined not to ) ield ; and therefore the moſt fatal effects enſued» The firſt thing of conſequence was the death of <hi rend="italic">Seit</hi></p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
