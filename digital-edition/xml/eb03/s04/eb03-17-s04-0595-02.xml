a name always conjoined with Man, in mentioning the biſhop of Man’s dioceſe. Concerning the origin and application of this word, very different opinions have been formed by the learned. Buchanan (lib. i. cap. 34 ) ſays, that before his time the name of <hi rend="italic">Sodor</hi> was given to a town in the isle of Man. In Gough’s edition of Camden’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> (vol. iii. p. 701.) it is ſaid, that after the isle of Man was annexed to the crown of England, this appellation was given to a ſmall iſland within muſket-ſhot of Man, in which the cathedral ſtands, called by the Norwegians the <hi rend="italic">Holm,</hi> and by the inhabitants the <hi rend="italic">Peel.</hi> In ſupport of this opinion a charter is quoted A. D. 1505, in which Thomas earl of Derby and lord of Man confirms to Huan Heſketh biſhop of Sodor all the lands, &amp; c. anciently belonging to the biſhops of Man. “ Ecclesiam cathedralem ſancti Germani in <hi rend="italic">Holm Sodor vel Pels</hi> vocatam, ecclesiam ſancti Patricii ibidem, et locum præfatum in quo ecclesiæ præsatæ sitæ ſunt.” The truth of either, or perhaps of both, theſe accounts might be allowed; but neither of them are sufficient to account for the conſtant conjunction of Sodor and Man, in charters, regiſters, and hiſtories. If Sodor was a ſmall town or iſland belonging to Man, it cannot be conceived why it is always mentioned before it, or rather why it ſhould be mentioned at all in ſpeaking of a biſhop’s dioceſe. To ſpeak oſ the biſhopric of Sodor and Man in this cafe would be as improper as it would be to call the biſhopric of Durham the biſhopric of Holy Island and Durham, or the biſhopric of Darlington and Durham ; the former being a ſmall island and the latter a town belonging to the county and dioceſe of Durham. Neither of theſe accounts, therefore, give a ſatisfactory account of the original conjunction of Sodor and Man.</p><p>The island of Iona was the place where the biſhop of the isles resided, the cathedral church of which, it is ſaid, was dedicated to our Saviour, in Greek <hi rend="italic">Soter,</hi> hence <hi rend="italic">Sotorenſes,</hi> which might be corrupted into <hi rend="italic">Sodorenſes,</hi> a name frequently given by Daniſh writers to the weſtern isles of Scotland. That we may be the more diſpoſed to accede to this Grecian etymology, the advocates for this opinion tell us, that the name I <hi rend="italic">columkill,</hi> which is often applied to this iſland, is alſo of Greek extraction, being derived from c <hi rend="italic">olumba,</hi> “ a pigeon ;” a meaning that exactly correſponds to the Celtic word O <hi rend="italic">olum</hi> and the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Iona.</hi> We muſt confeſs, however, that we have very little faith in the conjectures of etymologiſts, and think that upon no occaſion they alone can eſtablifh any tact, though when concurring with facts they certainly tend to confirm and explain them. It is only from hiſtorical facts that we can know to what Sodor was applied.</p><p>It appears from the hiſtory of the Orkneys, compiled</p><p>by an old Iſlandſe writer, translated and enlarged by Torfæus, that the Æbudæ or Weſtern isles of Scotland were divided into two cluſters, Nordureys and Sudereys. The Nordureys, which were ſeparated from the Sudereys by the point of Ardnamurchan, a promontory in Argyleſhire, consiſted of Muck, Egg, Rum, Canna, Sky, Rafay, Barra, South Uiſt, North Uiſt, Benbecula, and Lewis, including Harris, with a great number of ſmall isles. The Sudereys were, Man, Arran, Bute, Cumra, Avon, Gid, Ila, Colonſay, Jura, Scarba, Mull, Iona, Tiree, Coll, Ulva, and other ſmall iſlands. All theſe, when joined together, and ſubject to the same prince, made up the kingdom of Man and the isles. In the Norwegian language <hi rend="italic">Suder</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Norder,</hi> signifying ſouthern and northern, and ey or <hi rend="italic">ay</hi> an island. When the Æbudæ were under one monarch, the seat of empire was fixed in the Sudereys, and the Nordureys were governed by deputies ; hence the former are much oftener mentioned in hiſtory than the latter ; hence, too, the Sudereys often comprehend the Nordureys, as in our days Scotland is ſometimes comprehended under England. Sudereys, or Suder, when angliciſed, became Sodor ; and all the weſtern iſles of Scotland being included in one dioceſe under the Norwegian princes, the biſhop appointed to ſuperintend them was called the biſhop of Man and the isles, or the. biſhop of Sodor and Man. Since Man was conquered by Edward III. it has been ſeparated from the other isles, and its biſhops have exerciſed no juriſdiction over them. Should it now be aſked, why then is the biſhop of Man ſtill called the biſhop of Sodor and Man ? we reply, that we have been able to diſcover no reaſon ; but ſuppoſe the appellation to be continued in the ſame way, as the title king of France, has been kept up by the kings of Great Britain, for ſeveral centuries after the Engliſh were entirely expelled from France.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
