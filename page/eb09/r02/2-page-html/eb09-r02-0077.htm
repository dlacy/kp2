<p><span class="font1">having learnt that he is employing the figure called irony.” But when it is thus urged that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ All a rhetorician’s rules “ But teach him how to name his tools, ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the assumption is tacitly made that an accurate nomenclature and classification of these tools must be devoid of practical use. The conditions of modern life, and especially&nbsp;the invention of printing, have diminished the importance&nbsp;which belonged in antiquity to the art of speaking. But&nbsp;few would deny that a large measure of value may still be&nbsp;claimed for rhetoric in the more comprehensive sense&nbsp;which Whately gives to it, as the art of argumentative&nbsp;composition. His treatise, the work of an able and also&nbsp;witty man, will be found instructive and entertaining even&nbsp;by those who do not go to it for a discipline. Nor can it&nbsp;fail to suggest a further remark. While abounding in&nbsp;fresh thought and modern illustration, it constantly reminds&nbsp;us that, in almost all essentials, the art of rhetoric must be&nbsp;regarded as the creation of Aristotle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r. c. j.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHEUMATISM, a constitutional disease having for its chief manifestations inflammatory affections of the fibrous&nbsp;textures of joints and other parts, together with a liability&nbsp;to various complications. Two forms of rheumatism are&nbsp;recognized, and will be now briefly described, namely, the&nbsp;acute and the chronic, the latter either resulting from the&nbsp;former or arising independently. In addition to these, a&nbsp;disease -which has received the name of chronic rheumatic&nbsp;(or rheumatoid) arthritis, and which presents many resemblances to chronic rheumatism, although the relation&nbsp;between them is questionable, may be noticed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Acute Rheumatism, frequently called Rheumatic Fever, is mainly characterized by inflammation affecting&nbsp;various joints, with a tendency to spread in an erratic&nbsp;manner, and accompanied with much pain, febrile disturbance, and perspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The nature of this disease has been extensively discussed by pathologists and physicians ; but, although numerous,&nbsp;and many of them ingenious, theories have been advanced&nbsp;and supported by evidence drawn from experimentation as&nbsp;well as clinical observation, it cannot yet be said that any&nbsp;one of them has gained general acceptance. It has been held&nbsp;that rheumatism is produced by an excess of lactic acid in&nbsp;the system in connexion with morbid states of the nutritive&nbsp;functions. Support to this view was given experimentally&nbsp;by Dr Richardson, but experiments by others have led to&nbsp;a different conclusion. Again, it has been held that the&nbsp;disease is a textural inflammation due to chill acting upon&nbsp;the parts, either locally through the circulation or through&nbsp;the agency of the nervous system, whereby the nutrition&nbsp;of the joints and Other structures is lowered. Another&nbsp;view regards it as arising primarily in a profound disturb&nbsp;ance of the heat-regulating mechanism of the body by chill,&nbsp;which specially affects the muscular system, causing heat&nbsp;to be generated without work, one of the consequences&nbsp;being that impressions of pain are conveyed to the brain&nbsp;by the articular nerves instead of those of work performed&nbsp;(see Pathology). The view has been held, too, that&nbsp;rheumatism is to be referred to a germ or parasite, or a&nbsp;miasm analogous to the poison of malaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Without attempting to discuss the relative probability of these and other theories, it may be stated that those&nbsp;which point in the direction of a nutritional change in the&nbsp;special tissues affected (the fibrous) as the result of chill&nbsp;or other depressing cause operating through the agency&nbsp;of the nervous system appear more consonant with the&nbsp;pathological evidences of the disease itself than those&nbsp;which would refer the morbid process to the influence of&nbsp;any poison circulating in the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are certain points of importance in connexion with the causation of this form of the disease which are&nbsp;generally agreed upon. Thus an hereditary tendency is&nbsp;recognized as among the causes predisposing to acute&nbsp;rheumatism. The extent of this has been variously estimated, but it would appear to be well established that it&nbsp;shows itself in about one-fourth of the cases. Age is&nbsp;another important predisposing condition, the acute form&nbsp;of rheumatism being much more a disease of youth than&nbsp;of later life. The period of adolescence, from sixteen to&nbsp;twenty, is that in which probably the greater number of the&nbsp;cases occur ; but even in early childhood the disease may&nbsp;manifest itself, or at any period of life, although it is rarely&nbsp;observed in old age. Persons much exposed to all kinds&nbsp;of weather are specially liable to suffer, and hence the&nbsp;disease is more common among the poorer classes. Any&nbsp;depressing cause acting upon the general health, such as&nbsp;overwork or anxiety, or any habitual drain upon the&nbsp;system, such as overlactation, in like manner has a similar&nbsp;effect. Climate, too, is a factor of great importance, for,&nbsp;although not unfrequently met with in temperate or even&nbsp;warm climates, the disease is unquestionably of more common occurrence in cold and damp regions. Attacks of&nbsp;acute rheumatism are brought on in most instances by&nbsp;exposure to cold, by getting wet through, sometimes also&nbsp;by excessive fatigue such as in walking long distances,&nbsp;especially if in addition there have been overheating of the&nbsp;body and subsequent chill. Persons who have once suffered&nbsp;from this disease are very liable to a recurrence on a renewal&nbsp;of the exciting cause, and even apparently independently&nbsp;of this from such causes as digestive disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An attack of acute rheumatism is usually ushered in by chilliness or rigors followed with feverishness and a feeling&nbsp;of stiffness or pain in one or more joints, generally those&nbsp;of larger or medium size, such as the knees, ankles, wrists,&nbsp;shoulders, &lt;fcc., which soon becomes intense, and is accompanied with severe constitutional disturbance and prostration. The patient lies helpless in bed, restless, but afraid&nbsp;to move or to be touched, and unable to bear even the&nbsp;weight of the bed-clothes. The face is flushed, and the&nbsp;whole body bathed in perspiration, which has a highly&nbsp;acid reaction and a sour disagreeable odour. The temperature is markedly elevated (103° to 105°), the pulse rapid,&nbsp;full, and soft ; the tongue is coated with a yellow fur ;&nbsp;and there are thirst, loss of appetite, and constipation.&nbsp;The urine is diminished in quantity, highly acid, and&nbsp;loaded with urates. At first the pain is confined to only&nbsp;one or two joints, but soon others become affected, and&nbsp;there is often a tendency to symmetry in the manner in&nbsp;which they suffer, the inflammation in one joint being&nbsp;shortly followed by that of the same joint in the opposite&nbsp;limb. The affected joints are red, swollen, hot, and excessively tender. The inflammation seldom continues long&nbsp;in one articulation, but it may return to those formerly&nbsp;affected. In severe cases scarcely a joint large or small&nbsp;escapes, and the pain, restlessness, and fever render the&nbsp;patient’s condition extremely miserable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An attack of acute rheumatism is of variable duration, sometimes passing away in the course of a few days, but&nbsp;more frequently lasting for many weeks. Occasionally,&nbsp;when the disease appears to have subsided, relapses occur&nbsp;which bring back all the former symptoms and prolong the&nbsp;case, it may be for months. Again, after all acute symptoms have disappeared, the joints may remain swollen, stiff,&nbsp;and painful on movement, and the rheumatic condition&nbsp;thus becomes chronic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After an attack of rheumatism, the patient is much reduced in strength and pale-looking for a considerable&nbsp;time, but should no complication have arisen there may&nbsp;be complete recovery, although doubtless there remains&nbsp;a liability to subsequent attacks. This disease derives&nbsp;much of its serious import from certain accompaniments</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
