<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“ buried together in one confused chaos, dust, and filth in the dark corners of Ciesar’s chapel in the White Towel־.” He employed&nbsp;soldiers and women to remove and cleanse them, “ who soon growing weary of this noisome work left them as foul, dusty, and&nbsp;nasty as they found them.” He then begged the aid of the clerks&nbsp;of his department, but these officials, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> being unwilling to touch the&nbsp;records for fear of fouling their fingers, spoiling their clothes,&nbsp;endangering their eyesight and healths by their cankerous dust and&nbsp;evil scent,” declined the task. To the energetic Prynne the labour&nbsp;of methodizing the papers in his charge seemed hopeless ; he saw&nbsp;them in confused heaps hidden here and scattered there and destitute&nbsp;of anything approaching to an index. He lamented that it would&nbsp;require “Briareus his hundred hands, Argus his hundred eyes,&nbsp;and Nestor’s centuries of years to marshal them into distinct files&nbsp;and make exact alphabetical tables of the several things, names,&nbsp;places, comprised in them.” Still nothing was done to remedy&nbsp;the evils complained of. Addresses were presented to parliament&nbsp;upon the subject; reports were drawn up and committees frequently&nbsp;sat; but it was not until the beginning of this century that a complete and satisfactory investigation of the public records was entered&nbsp;into. In the summer of 1800 a very able report upon the state of&nbsp;the archives was drawn up; and a commission was appointed “to&nbsp;methodize, regulate, and digest the records.” But the commission&nbsp;directed its attention exclusively to the printing of antiquarian&nbsp;matter, and nothing was attempted for the better preservation of&nbsp;the archives. Dissatisfaction arose, and a select committee of the&nbsp;House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the working of&nbsp;the Record Commission. The result of its sittings was the passing&nbsp;of a special Act of Parliament, which placed the public records in&nbsp;the custody and under the superintendence of the master of the rolls&nbsp;for the time being, and directed the treasury forthwith to provide&nbsp;a suitable building. In 1851 the foundations of the present Record&nbsp;Repository were laid, and seven years afterwards the public records&nbsp;were removed from their different places of deposit and housed in&nbsp;their new quarters, where they are now most carefully preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The history of the custody of the state papers which run from Henry VIII. to the present time is but a repetition of the neglect&nbsp;and ill-treatment which the public records had to endure. When&nbsp;they first began to be preserved they were locked up in chests, then&nbsp;confined in the larder of the privy seal, then lodged in the tower&nbsp;over the gateway of Whitehall Palace, then transferred to the upper&nbsp;floor of the lord chamberlain’s lodgings, then despatched to an old&nbsp;house in Scotland Yard ; and it was not till 1833 that the State&nbsp;Paper Office in St James’s Park was specially erected for their&nbsp;accommodation. Twenty years later it was deemed advisable by&nbsp;the Government of the day to amalgamate the state papers with&nbsp;the public records; the State Paper Office was therefore pulled&nbsp;down and its contents transferred to the repository in Fetter Lane.&nbsp;On making a careful examination of the state of the documents, it&nbsp;was found that many of them had “greatly suffered from vermin&nbsp;and wet,” and that the list of those which had been stolen or had&nbsp;strayed from the collection was no small one. Theft and destruction&nbsp;for private ends appear to have been the two chief agents of mischief. During the reign of Henry VIII. many of the despatches&nbsp;were appropriated by Lord St Albans and Lord Cherbury, to&nbsp;whom they were entrusted. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth most&nbsp;of the private business papers of Her Majesty, especially her letters&nbsp;on matters of secret importance, came into the hands of the earl&nbsp;of Leicester and finally into the possession of his secretary and&nbsp;his descendants; and, “though they were ultimately recovered,&nbsp;a great part had perished by time and the distraction of the&nbsp;wars, &amp;c. ; being left in England during the Rebellion, many had&nbsp;been abused to the meanest purposes.” Upon the outbreak of&nbsp;the Civil War the king’s papers from the time he was in the north&nbsp;till the surrender of Oxford were designedly burned; whilst “a&nbsp;fair cabinet of the king’s, full of papers of a very secret nature,&nbsp;which had been left by the king upon his retirement to the Scots,&nbsp;amongst which were thought to be all the queen’s letters to&nbsp;the king and things of a very mysterious nature,” was also destroyed. In the turbulent days of the Commonwealth Bradshaw,&nbsp;in his capacity as president of the council, managed to obtain&nbsp;possession “of divers books, treaties, papers, and records of state,”&nbsp;some of which, in spite of all the efforts of Charles II., were not&nbsp;regained. At the Restoration “all the papers of state during the&nbsp;time of the usurpation remained in Thurloe’s hands, and Sir Samuel&nbsp;Morland advised a great minister to have them seized, being then&nbsp;privately in four great deal desks ; but for reasons left to be judged,&nbsp;that minister delayed to order it, and Thurloe had time to burn&nbsp;them that would have hanged a great many, and he certainly did&nbsp;burn them except some principal ones culled out by himself.”&nbsp;During the reign of Charles II. various papers were sent out of&nbsp;the country to The Hague and Sweden for the convenience of&nbsp;ambassadors, many of which were never returned. Indeed so carelessly did ministers watch their own documents that a treaty concluded with Holland in 1654 was bought at an auction, and the&nbsp;original treaty with Portugal in the same year was found on a stall&nbsp;in the street. Within almost a comparatively recent date there</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">were instances of documents sent out of the State Taper Office which were never returned,—a fact which may account for many&nbsp;of the purely official papers to be found in the manuscript collections of private individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite, however, of past thefts and negligence, the state papers, like the public records, are a most wealthy and valuable collection.&nbsp;Their contents were considered so important that at one time it&nbsp;was a matter of the greatest difficulty for any outsider to obtain&nbsp;access to them. The keeper of the state papers was bound by oath&nbsp;“to let no man see anything in the office of His Majesty’s papers&nbsp;without a warrant from the king.” He was also “tied by a strict&nbsp;oath and by His Majesty’s commands to deliver nothing out of the&nbsp;office unless to the lords and others of the council. ” During the&nbsp;whole history of the State Paper Office the keeper never had power&nbsp;to grant on his own authority leave to consult the papers ; such&nbsp;permission could only be obtained from the secretary of state, to&nbsp;whose office the documents belonged. Among the persons fortunate&nbsp;enough to have this favour accorded them, we find that in 1670&nbsp;Evelyn was lent several documents which related to Holland ; that&nbsp;in 1679 Dr Gilbert Burnet was permitted by warrant “from time&nbsp;to time to have the sight and use of such papers and books as he&nbsp;shall think may give him information and help in finishing his&nbsp;history of the Reformation of the Church of England”; and that&nbsp;in the same year Prince Rupert made a personal request to the king&nbsp;on behalf of Roger L’Estrange, who was writing a history of the&nbsp;Civil War in England. In later times permission was more freely&nbsp;given, though the “library of MSS.” was still most vigilantly&nbsp;guarded, and applications were more often refused than granted.&nbsp;As an instance of the strictness with which the state papers were&nbsp;preserved, we find that as late as 1775 Lord North, though he was&nbsp;then prime minister, had to beg the king’s permission to have free&nbsp;access to all correspondence in the Paper Office; and that in 1780&nbsp;it was necessary for the Ordnance Office to have permission to search&nbsp;the Paper Office for any documents that regarded their department. These restrictions have now been entirely removed, thanks&nbsp;to the late Lord Romilly ; when he was master of the rolls, the&nbsp;public records were thrown open to the public free of all the&nbsp;charges that were formerly demanded for investigation, whilst the&nbsp;same liberal course has been pursued with regard to the state papers&nbsp;down to the year 1760. After that date special permission has&nbsp;to be obtained. Calendars and indexes of the public records are&nbsp;annually published in the appendices to the reports of the deputy-keeper of the public records. Large volumes—entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Calendars&nbsp;of State Papers</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—consisting of condensations of the documents&nbsp;in the Public Record Office and elsewhere from the days of Henry&nbsp;VIII. to the 18th century are now in course of publication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REDBREAST, the name of a bird which from its manners, no less familiar than engaging, has for a long&nbsp;while been so great a favourite among all classes in Great&nbsp;Britain as to have gained an almost sacred character. The&nbsp;pleasing colour of its plumage—one striking feature of&nbsp;which is expressed by its ancient name—its sprightly air,&nbsp;full dark eye, enquiring and sagacious demeanour, added&nbsp;to the trust in man it often exhibits, but, above all, the&nbsp;cheerful sweetness of its song, even “when winter chills&nbsp;the day ” and scarce another bird is heard—combine to&nbsp;produce the effects just mentioned, so that among many&nbsp;European nations it has earned some endearing name,&nbsp;though there is no country in which “ Robin Redbreast ”&nbsp;is held so highly in regard as England.@@<sup>1</sup> Well known as&nbsp;is its appearance and voice throughout the whole year in&nbsp;the British Islands, there are not many birds which to the&nbsp;attentive observer betray more unmistakably the influence&nbsp;of the migratory impulse </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> but somewhat close scrutiny is&nbsp;needed to reveal this fact. In the months of July and&nbsp;August the hedgerows of the southern counties of England may be seen to be beset with Redbreasts, not in flocks&nbsp;as is the case with so many other species, but each indi-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> English colonists in far distant lands have gladly applied the common nickname of the Redbreast to other birds that are not immediately allied to it.
