<p><span class="font4">their names ; and it muſt be confeſſed, that his replies abounded with ſarcaſms, which the moſt rational friends&nbsp;to the caufe which he ſupported would not have been&nbsp;ſorry to ſee blotted from his pages. The provocation,&nbsp;however, which he received was great ; and Mr Ram-fay, though an amiable, virtuous, and pious man, had&nbsp;a warmth of temper, which, though not deſerving of&nbsp;praiſe, will be cenſuredby none who reflect on the frailties&nbsp;of our common nature. That the particular calumnies&nbsp;propagated againſt him on this occaſion were wholly&nbsp;gronndleſs, it is impoffible to doubt, if we admit him&nbsp;to have been poſſeſſed of common underſtanding. when&nbsp;ſome years ago a ſtory was circulated, of Swift’s ha-ving, when prebendary of Kilroot, been convicted before a magiſtrate of an attempt to commit a rape on&nbsp;the body of one of his pariſhioners, it was thought a&nbsp;ſufficient confutation of the calumny to put the retail-er of it in mind, that the dean of St Patrick’s, though&nbsp;deteſted by the moſt powerful faction in the kingdom,&nbsp;lampooned without dread, and with great ſeverity, the&nbsp;dean of Ferns for the very crime of which, had thi3&nbsp;anecdote been true, he muſt have been conſcious that&nbsp;all Ireland knew himſelf to be guilty ! Such conduct&nbsp;cannot be reconciled to common ſenſe. Had Swift&nbsp;been a raviſher, though he might have been penitent,&nbsp;and reaſoned in general terms againſt giving way to&nbsp;ſuch licentious paſſions, he would never have ſatyriſed&nbsp;a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">particular perſon</span><span class="font4"> for the crime of which he himſelf&nbsp;ſtood convicted. In like manner, had Mr Ramſay been&nbsp;a tyrant to his own ſlaves, though he might have ar-gued againſt ſlavery in the abſtract, on the broad baſis&nbsp;of virtue and religion, he never could have arraigned&nbsp;for ſimilar cruelty a number of individuals in the very&nbsp;iſland which wſtneſſed his own enormities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the melancholy part of the narrative is behind. The agitation given to his mind by theſe calumnies,&nbsp;and the fatigues he underwent in his endeavours to re-ſcqe from mifery the moſt helpleſs portion of the human&nbsp;race, contributed to ſhorten a iife in no common degree&nbsp;uſeful. He had been for ſome time afflicted with a pain&nbsp;in his ſtomach, for which he was prevailed upon, tho’&nbsp;with great reluctance, to try the effects of air and exerciſe, by attempting a journey of 100 miles. But in&nbsp;London, being ſeized with a violent vomiting of blood,&nbsp;he was unable either to proceed or to be removed&nbsp;home ; and in the houſe of Sir Charles Middleton he&nbsp;ended his days, on the 20th of July 1789, amidſt the&nbsp;groans of his family, and the tears of many friends.—&nbsp;Thus died a man, of whom it is not too much to fay,&nbsp;that &quot; the bleſſing of many that were ready to periſh&nbsp;came upon him for whatever be the fate of the ſlave-trade (ſee Slavery), it is certain that his writings&nbsp;have contributed much to meliorate the treatment of&nbsp;ſlaves- He left behind him a widow and three daughters : and his works, beſides thoſe to which we have al-luded, conſiſt of a volume of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Seaſermons,</span><span class="font4"> preached on&nbsp;board his majeſty’s ſhip the Prince of wales, which&nbsp;ſhow him to have been a maſter of true pulpit-eloquence ; and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Treatſe on Signals,</span><span class="font4"> which was certainly&nbsp;written, and we think printed, though we know not&nbsp;whether it was ever publiſhed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">credible. On difcoveι⅛g the method of conſtruct'ng this machine, its inventor, Mr Ramſdsn of Piccadilly,&nbsp;received 615 1. from the commiſſioners of longitude ;&nbsp;engaging himſelf to inſtruct a certain number of perſons, not exceeding ten, in the method of making and&nbsp;uſing this machine from the 28th october </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1775</span><span class="font4"> to&nbsp;28th october 1777 : alſo binding himſelf to divide all&nbsp;octants and fextants by the fame engine, at the rate&nbsp;of three ſhillings for each octant, and ſix ſhillings for&nbsp;each braſs ſextant, with Nonius’s diviſions to half minutes, for as long time as the commiffioners ſhould&nbsp;think proper to let the engine remain in his poffeffion»&nbsp;Οί this fum of 615 1. paid to Mr Ramſden, 3001. was&nbsp;given him as a reward for the improvement made by&nbsp;him in diſcovering the engine, and the remaining 315l.&nbsp;for his giving up the property of it to the commiſ-ſioners. The following deſcription of the engine, is&nbsp;that given upon oath by Mr Ramſden himſelf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; This engine conſiſts of a large wheel of bell-metaI, ſupported on a mahogany ſtand, having three legs,&nbsp;which are ſtrongly connected together by braces, ſo&nbsp;as to make it perfectly ſteady. Οη each leg of the&nbsp;ſtand is placed a conical friction-pulley, whereon the&nbsp;dividing-wheel reſts : to prevent the wheel from Aiding off the friction-pulleys, the bell-metal centre under&nbsp;it turns in a ſocket on the top of the ſtand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; The circumference of the wheel is ratched or cut (by a method which will be deſcribed hereafter) into&nbsp;2160 teeth, in which an endleſs ſcrew acts. Six revolutions of the ſcrew will move the wheel a ſpace&nbsp;equal to one degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Now a circle of braſs being fixed on the ſcrew ar-bor, having its circumference divided into 60 parts, each diviſion will conſequently anſwer to a motion of&nbsp;the wheel of 10 ſeconds, ſix of them will be equal to&nbsp;a minute, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Several different arbors of tempered ſteel are truly ground into the ſocket in the centre of the wheel. The&nbsp;upper parts of the arbors that ſtand above the plane&nbsp;are turned of various ſizes, to ſuſt the centres of different pieces of work to be divided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; when any inſtrument is to be divided, the centre of it is very exactly fitted on one of theſe arbors ; and&nbsp;the inſtrument is fixed down to the plane of the dividing wheel, by means of ſcrews, which fit into holes&nbsp;made in the radii of the wheel for that purpoſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ The inſtrument being thus fitted on the plane of the wheel, the frame which carries the dividing-point&nbsp;is connected at one end by finger-ſcrews with the frame&nbsp;which carries the endlefs ſcrew ; while the other end&nbsp;embraces that part of the ſteel arbor, which ſtands&nbsp;above the inſtrument to be divided, by an angular&nbsp;notch in a piece of hardened ſteel ; by this means both&nbsp;ends of the frame are kept perfectly ſteady and free&nbsp;from any ſhake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; The frame carrying the dividing-point or tracer, is made to ſlide on the frame which carries the endlefs&nbsp;ſcrew to any diſtance from the centre of the wheel </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">the radius of the inſtrument to be divided may require,&nbsp;and may be there faſtened by tightening two clamps ;&nbsp;and the dividing-point or tracer being connected with&nbsp;the clamps by the double-jointed frame, admits a free&nbsp;and eafy motion towards or from the centre for cutting the diviſions, without any lateral ſhake.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; From what has been ſaid, it appears, that an in-</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
