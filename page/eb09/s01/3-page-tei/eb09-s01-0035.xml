            <p>To the casual observer sails when spread and in use appear merely as so many large
                pieces of cloth; but some of them are of very considerable size: it is not at all
                unusual in full square-rigged ships for a main-course or main-sail to contain 1000
                yards of canvas (24 inches wide), and a main-top-sail nearly as much,—the single
                suit for such a vessel comprising upwards of 10,000 yards. Courses and top-sails are
                made reducible ; in the British navy they are reduced by means of reefs (two in
                courses, four in top-sails), each fitted with spilling, slab, and reef lines and
                becket, and toggles on the yard (reef-points throughout being now obsolete). In the
                merchant service double top-sails—upper and lower—are much in use on account of
                handiness in reducing sail; there is also “ patent reefing gear,” such as
                Cunningham’s, which allows reefing to be done as much as possible from deck. The
                dimensions of masts and yards, quantity of canvas or area of sail, centre of gravity
                of each sail (from which the moment of sail is obtained and compared with the moment
                of stability), centre of effort of the sails, and other important calculations
                necessary in relation to the body of the vessel are made by constructors and naval
                architects.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Sailcloth</hi> is obtainable from any description of fibrous
                material capable of being woven into cloth, having sufficient compactness and
                closeness of texture, and possessing the requisite strength for sustaining the heavy
                pressure which sails often have to bear in severe weather. Several descriptions of
                fibre might be enumerated which would to a certain extent serve for sailcloth but
                for the absence of quality of endurance or resistance; hemp has been and is now
                occasionally used, as also a mixture of cotton and linen yarn, or cotton
                only,—especially in America; but in the United Kingdom <hi rend="smallcaps">Flax
                    </hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> is the usual staple material, since, when
                well manufactured, it possesses the qualities of flexibility and lightness, and,
                what is still more important, the element of strength in a very large degree.</p>
            <p>The following points may be regarded as of primary importance for securing sailcloth
                or canvas of a superior quality and durability. Whatever flax is used, it is
                absolutely necessary that the “warp” and “weft ” of the canvas be spun wholly from
                the “ longs,” be free from blacks and any mixture of short flax, well dressed or
                heckled, and that the yarn be well and evenly spun and properly twisted. Both warp
                and weft yarn should be twice boiled with the best American pot and pearl ashes, and
                carefully and thoroughly washed and cleansed. No acid chloride of lime or other
                preparation of chlorine, nor any deleterious substance, should be used in any stage
                of the process, otherwise the integrity of the fibre will most probably be
                interfered with ; the only advantage got is that the cloth looks much whiter, which
                for yachts and pleasure-boats is perhaps desirable, but for naval and mercantile
                uses is not at all necessary. The yarns are first boiled a sufficient length of time
                in a solution of the best American potash, in fixed proportions of ashes, green
                yarn, and water, then mill-washed (beating process), and subsequently carefully
                washed in a considerable stream of clear running water, and wrung. They are again
                boiled for a sufficient length of time in a solution of American pearl ashes, in due
                proportions of ashes, green yarn, and water, then carefully rinsed, or washed in a
                clear stream of water, carefully dried, and frequently shaken in the course of
                drying, so that the fibres of the flax may be equally stretched. These repeated
                boilings, &amp;c., have the effect of cleansing, bleaching, softening, and removing
                all vegetable impurities which may be hanging about; no starch, tallow, paste, or
                weaver’s dressing of any description should be used, otherwise the fabric will tend
                to mildew if allowed to remain damp for any time. Sail- cloth is made in bolts,
                mostly 24 inches wide, but also 18 inches wide, and for yachting purposes frequently
                still less wide, upon the ground that the narrower the cloth the flatter and better
                will the sail stand to its work. It is generally made of eight different qualities
                in respect of thickness, numbered 1 to 8 accordingly ; the heavier numbers—Nos. 1,
                2, and 3—are used for storm and other sails that have to do heavy work, the
                remaining numbers for the lighter descriptions of sail. The weight of each bolt of
                canvas 24 inches wide, from Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive for 39 yards in length and</p>
            <p>for Nos. 7 and 8 for 40 yards in length, is about as follows, viz., No. 1, 46 lb ;
                No. 2, 43 ; No. 3, 40 ; No. 4, 36; No. 5, 33 ; No. 6, 30 ; No. 7, 27 ; No. 8, 25 lb.
                The weight of each bolt of narrower canvas is in proportion. The warp (or
                lengthwise) should consist of the following proportions of clean unstarched yarn,

            <p>As a rule about 40 yards in length may be considered as the average content of each
                bolt. Particular attention should be paid to the weaving, that the texture be struck
                sufficiently close, and the selvages be evenly and well manufactured; what is termed
                a slack selvage (that is, one selvage longer than the other) is not only awkward for
                the sailmaker but unsatisfactory both in wear and appearance, the slack side showing
                itself puckered. Sailcloth made upon these conditions is very likely to be a good
                article ; tests, however, can be applied, generally to strips 1 inch wide from Nos.
                1 to 6 inclusive, and 1<hi rend="superscript">1/</hi><hi rend="subscript">2</hi>
                inch wide from Nos. 7 and 8. Weft and warp (24 inches in length) in each case are
                placed in a small testing machine, which has a dial plate with a spring underneath ;
                vices are attached to grip the strips, one vice to the spring, the other in
                connexion with a long screw’ with a handle ; by turning this handle the vices are
                drawn asunder until the strip breaks, and the hands on the dial-plate indicate the
                strain in pounds. The following is a fair test of strength for the various numbers
                of good sailcloth :—</p>

            <p>It is not at all unusual, however, to find some sailcloth stand a strain considerably
                in excess of this. Freedom from blacks, twist and spun of the yarn, stiffening,
                calendering, &amp;c., can be discovered by observation and a magnifying glass,
                excessive dressing by a little tincture of iodine.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Sailmaking</hi> is a very old branch of industry in connexion with
                the navy and commerce, and it still continues to be important notwithstanding the
                enormous extent to which steam is now employed in navigation.</p>
            <p>The operations of the sailmaker may be stated as follows. The dimensions of mast and
                yards and sail plan being supplied, the master sailmaker is enabled to determine the
                dimensions of each sail—after due allowance for stretching—in terms of cloths and
                depth in yards—if a square sail, the number of cloths in the head, number in the
                foot, and the depth in yards ; if a fore-and-aft sail (triangular), the number of
                cloths in the foot, and the depth in yards of the luff or stay and of leech or
                after-leech ; if a fore-and- aft sail (trapezium form), the number of cloths in the
                head, number in foot, and the depth of mast or luff and of after-leech. These
                particulars obtained, there is got out what is technically termed a “casting,” which
                simply means the shape, length, &amp;c., of each individual cloth in the sail. These
                figures are given to the cutter, who proceeds to cut out the sail cloth by cloth in
                consecutive order, numbering them 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. ; the series of cloths thus
                cut out are handed over to the workman, who joins them together by carefully made
                double flat seams, sewn with twine specially prepared for the purpose, with about
                120 stitches in a yard. In the heavy sails the seam is about an inch and a half in
                width and in the British navy stuck or stitched in the middle of the seam to give
                additional strength ; the seams in the lighter sails are about an inch wide. The
                whole of the cloths are then brought together, and spread out, and the tabling (or
                hemming, so to speak) is turned in and finished off with about 72 stitches to a
                yard. Strengthening pieces or “linings” are affixed where considered necessary, in
                courses and top-sails such pieces as reef-bands, middle-bands, foot- bands,
                leech-linings, bunt-line cloths ; in top-sails (only) a top- lining or brim ; in
                other and lighter sails such pieces as mast-lining clew and head, tack, and corner
                pieces ; holes, such as head, reef, stay (luff), mast, cringle, bunt-line, &amp;c.,
                are also made where re- quired, a grommet of line of suitable size being worked in
                them to prevent their being cut through. The next thing to be done is to secure the
                edges of the sail,—an important operation, as much depends upon this whether the
                sail will stand well and do its work efficiently. Bolt-rope, a comparatively soft
                laid rope made from the finer hemp yarn (Italian) is used for this purpose ; in the
                British navy it ranges from 1 inch (increasing in size by quarter inches) up to 8
                inches inclusive, the size selected for each part of a sail being determined by the
                amount of strain it will have to bear; it is then neatly sewn on with roping twine
                specially prepared, the needle and twine passing between and clear of every two
                strands of the rope in roping. Where slack sail has to be taken in, it is the
                practice to leave it to the judgment of the sail</p>
