Shoeing does not appear to have been practised by either Greeks or Romans; but there is evidence that the art was known to the Celts, and that the practice became common after the overthrow of the Western empire towards the close of the 5th century. It is only recently that horse-shoeing was introduced in Japan, where the former practice was to attach to the horse’s feet slippers of straw, which were renewed when necessary. In modern times much attention has been devoted to horse-shoeing, with the result of showing that methods formerly adopted caused cruel injury to horses and serious loss to their owners. The evils as summarized by Mr George Fleming, army (British) veterinary inspector, were caused by (1) paring the sole and frog; (2) applying shoes too heavy and of faulty shape ; (3) employing too many and too large nails ; (4) applying shoes too small and removing the wall of the hoof to make the feet fit the shoes ; and (5) rasping the front of the hoof. According to modern principles (1) shoes should be as light as compatible with the wear demanded of them ; (2) the ground face of the shoe should be concave, and the face applied to the foot plain ; (3) heavy draught horses alone should have toe and heel calks on their shoes to increase foothold ; (4) the excess growth of the wall or outer portion of horny matter should only be removed in re-shoeing, care being taken to keep both sides of the hoof of equal height ; (5) the shoe should fit accurately to the circumference of the hoof, and project slightly beyond the heel ; (6) the shoes should be fixed with as few nails as possible, six or seven in fore-shoes and eight in hind-shoes ; and (7) the nails should take a short thick hold of the wall, so that old nail-holes may be removed with the natural growth and paring of the horny matter. Horse shoes and nails are now made with great economy by machinery. In rural districts, where the art of the farrier is sometimes combined with blacksmith work, too little attention is, in general, given to considerations which have an important bearing on the comfort, usefulness, and life of the horse.</p><p>SHOLAPUR, a British district of India, in the Deccan division of the Bombay presidency, with an area of 4521 square miles, lying between 17° 13' and 18° 35' N. lat. and 74° 39' and 76° 11' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Ahmadnagar district, on the E. by the nizam’s territory and Akalkot state, on the S. by Kaladgi district and some of the Patvardhan states, and on the W. by Sátára and Poona districts and the states of Phaltan and Panth Pratinidhi. Except in Karmala and Barsi subdivisions, situated in the north and east, where there is a good deal of hilly ground, the district is generally flat or undulating ; but it is very bare of vegetation, and presents everywhere a bleak treeless appearance. The chief rivers are the Bhima and its tributaries—the Μάη, the Nira, and the Sina—all flowing towards the south-east. Besides these there are several smaller streams. Lying in a tract of uncertain rainfall, Sholapur is peculiarly liable to seasons of scarcity; much, however, has been done by the opening of canals and ponds, such as the Ekrúk and Ashti tanks, to secure a better water-supply. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway enters the district at Pomalvádi in the northwest corner and crosses it in a south-easterly direction, a distance of nearly 150 miles. Sholapur has recently been connected with a branch of the Southern Mahratta Railway.</p><p>The population of Sholapur district in 1881 was 582,487 (294,814 males and 287,673 females). Hindus numbered 530,121, Mohammedans 43,967, and Christians 625. There are three towns with populations exceeding 10,000 each, viz., <hi rend="smallcaps">Sholapur</hi> (q.v.), Pan- dharpur (16,910), Barsi (16,126). In 1883-84 there were 1,763,340 acres under cultivation, of which 22,282 were twice cropped, besides 325,987 acres of fallow or grass land. Joár, which forms the staple food of the people, occupied 923,706 acres, bajri 298,239, wheat 55,504, rice 25,027, pulses 185,528, and oil-seeds 147,914 acres. The produce of the district finds an easy outlet by the railway to</p><p>Poona and Bombay. The chief exports are cotton, which comes from the nizam’s dominions, oil, oil-seeds, ghi, turmeric, and cotton cloth ; imports include salt, piece-goods, yarn, gunney bags, and iron ware. The chief industries are spinning, weaving, and dyeing. The silks and finer sorts of cotton cloth prepared in Sholapur bear a good name ; blankets are also woven in large numbers. The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 amounted to £129,429, of which the land-tax yielded £98,963.</p><p>Sholapur district passed from the Bahmani to the Bijápur kings and from them to the Maráthás. In 1818, on the fall of the Peshwa, it was ceded to the British, when it formed part of the Poona col- lectorate, but in 1838 it was made a separate collectorate. Since then its progress has been rapid.</p><p>SHOLAPUR, chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated in 17° 40' 18" N. lat. and 75° 56' 38" E. long., on the plain of the Sina. Its convenient situation between Poona and Haidarábád (Hyderabad), with a station on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, has made it the centre for the collection and distribution of goods over a large extent of country. The town contained in 1881 a population of 59,890 (males 30,410, females 29,480).</p><p>SHOOTING for sporting purposes requires in the use of firearms two fundamental principles on which rests the attainment of dexterity. These are, first, that the weight  of the weapon be such that the sportsman can carry and  wield it with ease ; and, secondly—of still greater importance—that the weapon be so adapted to his chest, arm, and eye that when it is raised and levelled in the act of taking aim it may be as part of his own body. An overheavy gun may be virtually lightened by being carried by an attendant and only handed to the sportsman when required; but a gun not exactly “fitting the shoulder,” cannot possibly serve its user with accuracy. The reason is plain. The slight divergence of his line of aim from the axis of the barrel, due to the shape of the gun not permitting the coincidence of the two when the weapon is used rapidly, creates a far from slight divergence of the pellets at any range beyond a few yards, and the object fired at, if struck at all, is only struck by the outer and weaker pellets. The increasing wildness of game-birds, in Great Britain at least, especially of partridges, through the modern system of cutting grain close to the ground and so leaving no sheltering stubble, demands rapid aim and discharge of the gun, and in consequence the efforts of gun- makers have been directed to the production of weapons of great lightness combined with power and precision. How different were the conceptions of our immediate predecessors is exemplified in such statements as “ a few additional pounds in the weight of a gun makes a deal of difference,” and “the most approved guns” are those “weighing, according to the fancy of the shooter, from six to nine pounds.” The most approved guns now vary in weight by a few ounces only, and their configuration not by inches, but by eighths and even sixteenths of an inch. There are also fine lines in their modelling which, while of great consequence, are imperceptible to the eye, and can only be demonstrated by the application of exact and delicate instruments. Yet each of these lines has an important purpose, and their combination produces the perfect weapon. An experienced gunsmith who has studied this branch of his business can catch the salient lines of a sportsman’s figure with the eye of an artist, and by the further aid of tests and measurements can construct for him a proper gun, and thus lay the foundation of a correct style of shooting. On the other hand, an unsuitable gun can only be aimed correctly with slowness, and by some straining of the muscles of the neck. Under such conditions correct and rapid shooting is at least improbable ; the spread of the shot alone prevents a complete miss. It is the correct configuration of the gun which brings into full effect the elaborate boring of the barrel, and gives</p></body></text></TEI>
