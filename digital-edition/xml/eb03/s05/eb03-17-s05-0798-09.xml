among the ancients, was inflicted upon ſlaves as a puniſhment. but more frequently as a mark to know them by : in which caſe, it was done by applying a red-hot iron marked with certain letters to their fore-heads, till a fair impreſſion was made; and then pouring ink into their furrows, that the inſcription might be the more conspicuous.</p><p>Soldiers were branded in the hand with the name or character of their general.</p><p>After the ſame manner, it was cuſtomary to stigmatize the worſhippers and votaries of ſome of the gods. The marks uſed on theſe occaſions were various ; ſometimes they contained the name of the god, ſometimes his particular enſign, as the thunderbolt of Jupiter, the trident of Neptune, the ivy of Bacchus, &amp;c. or they marked themselves with ſome myſtical number, whereby the god’s name was deſcribed. To theſe three ways of ſtigmatizing St John is ſuppoſed to refer (Rev. chap. xiii. ver. 16, 17.). Theodoret is of opinion, that the Jews were forbidden to brand themſelves with ſtigmata, becauſe the idolaters, by that ceremony, uſed to consecrate themſelves to their falſe gods.</p><p>Among ſome nations, ſtigmatizing was conſidered as a diſtinguiſhing mark of honour and nobility. In Thrace, as Herodotus tells us<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Lib. v.</p></note> *, it was practiſed by none but perſons of credit, nor omitted by any but perſons of the meaneſt rank. The ancient Britons are alſo ſaid to have imprinted on the bodies of their infants the figures of animals, and other marks, with hot irons.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
