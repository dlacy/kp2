<p><span class="font2">attaching the estate of his debtor, he had still the alternative of incarceration. This might be avoided under the Julian&nbsp;law of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cessio bonorum</span><span class="font2"> by the debtor's making a complete&nbsp;surrender of his goods to his creditor; but, failing such surrender,&nbsp;incarceration continued to be resorted to even under the legislation of Justinian. During the Empire, of course, it was not&nbsp;by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio</span><span class="font2"> that the incarceration was affected; for it&nbsp;went out of use with the definitive establishment of the formular&nbsp;system of procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was as directed against judgment and nexal debtors that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio</span><span class="font2"> was of most importance and chiefly made its mark in&nbsp;history. But there were other cases in which it was resorted to&nbsp;under special statutory authority, where a remedy seemed advisable&nbsp;more sharp and summary than that by ordinary action. In some&nbsp;of these it was spoken of as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio pro judicato {i.e.</span><span class="font2"> as if&nbsp;upon a judgment), in others as simple </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio {manus injectio&nbsp;pura).</span><span class="font2"> Jn the first the arrestee was not allowed to dispute his&nbsp;alleged indebtedness in person; he could do so only through a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vindex;</span><span class="font2"> and if no one intervened for him in that character he was&nbsp;carried off and dealt with by his arresting creditor as if a judgment&nbsp;had been obtained against him. In the second he was not required&nbsp;to find a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vindex,</span><span class="font2"> but might himself dispute the. verity of the charge&nbsp;made against him, under penalty, however, as is generally supposed&nbsp;(though it is disputed), of a duplication of his liability if he failed&nbsp;in his contention. By. a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex Valha,</span><span class="font2"> probably in the latter half of the&nbsp;6th century of the city, this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio pura</span><span class="font2"> was substituted&nbsp;for that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pro judicato</span><span class="font2"> in all cases in which the ground of arrest was&nbsp;neither judgment nor so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">depensum, i.e.</span><span class="font2"> payment by a surety&nbsp;or other party on account of the true debtor, who failed to relieve&nbsp;the former within six months of such payment.<sup>@@1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Pignoris Capionem<sup>@@2</sup> </span><span class="font2">In the ritual of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actio sacramenti</span><span class="font2"> thq </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis civilis et festucaria</span><span class="font2"> was a reminiscence&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vera solida vis</span><span class="font2"> with which men settled their&nbsp;disputes about property in the earliest infancy of the&nbsp;commonwealth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manus injectio</span><span class="font2"> was a survival from&nbsp;times when the wronged was held entitled to lay hands&nbsp;upon the wrongdoer, and himself subject him to punishment;&nbsp;custom and legislation intervened merely to regulate the conditions and mode of exercise of what essentially was still self-help.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pignoris capio</span><span class="font2"> self-help was likewise the dominant idea. It&nbsp;may be fairly enough described by the English legal term&nbsp;distress—the taking by one man of property belonging to&nbsp;another in satisfaction of or in security for a debt due by the&nbsp;latter which he had failed to pay. The seizure, however, did&nbsp;not proceed upon any judgment, nor did it require the warrant&nbsp;of a magistrate; it might be resorted to even in the absence&nbsp;of the debtor, and on a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dies nefastus;</span><span class="font2"> but it required to be&nbsp;accompanied by certain words of style, spoken probably in&nbsp;the presence of witnesses. It was only in a few exceptional&nbsp;cases that it was competent, in some by force of custom, in&nbsp;others by statute, nearly all of which seem to be given by&nbsp;Gaius,<sup>@@3</sup> and all of them being of a military, religious or fiscal&nbsp;character. What was the procedure, and what its effects, are&nbsp;far from certain. Jhering, founding on some expressions of&nbsp;Cicero's, conjectures that, whether the debt was disputed or&nbsp;not, the distrainer could neither destroy nor sell nor definitely&nbsp;appropriate his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pi gnus</span><span class="font2"> without magisterial authority,—that&nbsp;in every case he was bound to institute proceedings in justification of his caption, and to take in them the position of plaintiff.&nbsp;The idea is ingenious, and puts the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pignoris capio</span><span class="font2"> in a new and&nbsp;interesting light. It makes it a summary means of raising a&nbsp;question of right for whose judicial arbitrament no other process&nbsp;of law was open,—with the additional advantage that it secured&nbsp;instant satisfaction to the raiser of it in the event of the question&nbsp;being determined in bis favour. If against him, the inevitable&nbsp;result, in substance at least, must haye been a judgment that&nbsp;he bad no right to retain his pledge, with probably a finding</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">that he was further liable to its owner in the value of it, as a punishment for his precipitancy.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jzidicial or Quasi-Judicial Procedure outside the Legis Actiones.— </span><span class="font2">Whatever may have been the extent of the field covered by the&nbsp;actions of the law, they did not altogether exclude other&nbsp;judicial or quasi-judicial agencies. The supreme magistrate was frequently called upon to intervene in matters&nbsp;brought under his cognizance by petition or complaint,&nbsp;in which his. aid was sought not so much to protect a&nbsp;vested right of property or claim, as to maintain public order, or&nbsp;to prevent the occurrence or continuance, of a. state of matters that&nbsp;might prove prejudicial to family or individual interests. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C</span><span class="font2">rocess was not an action, with its stages </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in jure</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in judicio, </span><span class="font2">ut an inquiry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{cognitio)</span><span class="font2"> conducted from, first to last by the magistrate himself; and his finding, unless, it was a dismissal of the&nbsp;complaint or petition, was embodied in an order </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{decretum, inter -dictum)</span><span class="font2"> which it was for him to enforce by such means as he thought&nbsp;fit,—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manu militari,</span><span class="font2"> or by fine or imprisonment. Some jurists&nbsp;are disposed to give a very wide range to this magisterial intervention. One of its most important manifestations was in connexion with disputes about the occupancy of the public domain&nbsp;lands. These did not belong in property to the occupants, so that&nbsp;an action founded on ownership was out of the question. But, as&nbsp;the occupancy was not only recognized, but sanctioned by the state,&nbsp;it was right, indeed necessary in the interest of public order, that&nbsp;it should be protected against disturbance. In the measures&nbsp;resorted to for its protection Niebuhr recognized the origin of the&nbsp;famous possessory interdict </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">uti possidetis</span><span class="font2">; and, although opinions&nbsp;differ as to whether protection of the better right or prevention of&nbsp;a breach of the peace was. what primarily influenced the magistrate’s intervention, there is, apart from .some distinguished exceptions, a pretty general accord in accepting this view. Another&nbsp;illustration of this magisterial intervention is to be found in the&nbsp;interdiction of a spendthrift,—a decree depriving of his power of&nbsp;administration a man who was squandering his family estate and&nbsp;reducing his children to penury; a third presents itself in the&nbsp;removal of a tutor from office on the ground of negligence or maladministration, on complaint made to the magistrate by any third&nbsp;party in what was called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">postulatio suspecti tutoris;</span><span class="font2"> and a fourth&nbsp;in the putting of a creditor in possession of the goods of an insolvent&nbsp;debtor, which must have been common enough even before the&nbsp;general bankruptcy regulations of the .Rutilian edict. These are&nbsp;to be taken merely as examples of this magisterial intervention,&nbsp;which manifested itself in very various directions; and it is easy&nbsp;to see how largely such procedure might be utilized for remedying&nbsp;the grievances of persons who, from defect of complete legal title,&nbsp;want of statutory authority, or otherwise, were not in a position&nbsp;to avail themselves of the “ actions of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In one of the Valerio-Horatian laws consequent on the second secession of the plebeians there was mention of ten judges </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{judices&nbsp;decemviri),</span><span class="font2"> whose persons were declared as inviolable as those of&nbsp;the tribunes of the people and the plebeian aediles. These were,&nbsp;it is. generally supposed, a body of judges elected to officiate on&nbsp;remit from a. tribune or aedile in questions arising between members&nbsp;of the plebeian body. We are without details as to the institution&nbsp;of this plebeian judicatory, the questions that fell under its cognizance, the forms of process employed, the law administered by it&nbsp;and the effect of its judgments. It is not much referred to by the&nbsp;historians; and its decadence has been attributed to the fact that&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Hortensia</span><span class="font2"> of 287 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> made the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nundinae</span><span class="font2"> lawful court-days&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{dies fasti),</span><span class="font2"> and so made it possible for the country folk coming to&nbsp;the city to market to carry on their processes before the praetor.&nbsp;It has also been identified by some writers<sup>@@5</sup> with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">decemviri stlitibus&nbsp;judicandis,</span><span class="font2"> whose jurisdiction has been already noticed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{supra,</span><span class="font2"> p. 536).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As all in a manner exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must also be mentioned the pontiffs, the consuls, and afterwards&nbsp;the censors as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">magistri morum,</span><span class="font2"> the chiefs of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font2"> within the&nbsp;gentile corporations, and heads of families within their households.&nbsp;While it may be the fact that with the enactment of the XII.&nbsp;Tables the jurisdiction of the pontiffs<sup>@@6 </sup>was materially narrowed,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
