<p><label>ROUNDS</label>
in military matters, a detachment from the main-guard, of an officer or a non-commissioned officer and six men, who go round the rampart of a garrison, to listen if any thing be stirring without the place, and to see that the sentinels be diligent upon their duty, and all in order. In strict garrisons the rounds go every half-hour. The sentinels have orders to challenge at a distance, and to rest their arms as the round passes. All guards turn out, challenge, exchange the parole, and rest their arms.</p>
