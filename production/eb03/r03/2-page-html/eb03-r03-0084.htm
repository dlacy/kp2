<p><span class="font1">he generally loſt by purſuing it too far. He was better qualified to ftorm a citadel, or even to mount a breach, than patiently to ſuſtain a fiege ; and would&nbsp;have furniſhed an excellent hand to a general of a cooler head. This prince is celebrated for the invention of&nbsp;prints in mezzotinto, of wſhich he is ſaid to have taken&nbsp;the hint from a ſoldier’s ſcraping his ruſty fufil. The&nbsp;firſt print of this kind ever publiſhed was done by his&nbsp;highneſs, and may be ſeen in the firſt edition oſ Evelyn’s Sculptra. The ſecret is ſaid to have been ſoon after diſeovered by Sherwin an engraver, who made uſe&nbsp;of a loaded file for laying the ground. The prince,&nbsp;upon ſeeing one of his prints, ſuſpected that his ſervant&nbsp;had lent him his tool, which was a channeled roller ;&nbsp;but upon receiving full ſatisfaction to the contrary, he&nbsp;made him a preſent of it. The roller was afterwards&nbsp;laid aſide ; and an inſtrument with a crenelled edge,&nbsp;ſhaped like a ſhoemaker’s cutting-knife, was uſed inſtead of it. He alſo invented a metal called by his&nbsp;name, in which guns weι e caſt ; and contrived an excellent method of boring them, for which purpoſe a&nbsp;water-mill was erected at Hackney-marſh, to the great&nbsp;detriment of the undertaker, as the ſecret died with the&nbsp;illuſtrious inventor.</span></p>

Their exploſion is attended in&nbsp;the dark with a flaſh of light ; and by being boiled in&nbsp;oil, the drops are deprived of their exploſive quality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The moſt remarkable ſpecies is the aculeatus, or common butcher’s broom, common in the woods in many parts of England. It has roots compoſed of many&nbsp;thick fibres which twine about eaβh other ; from which&nbsp;ariſe ſeveral ſtiff green ſtalks about three feet high,&nbsp;lending out from their ſides ſeveral ſhort branches, gar-niſhed with ſtiff, oval, heart-ſhaped leaves, placed alternately on every part of the ſtalk, ending with ſharp&nbsp;prickly points. The flowers are produced in the&nbsp;middle, on the upper fide of the leaves ; they are ſmall,&nbsp;and cut into ſix parts ; of </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">purple colour, fitting cloſe&nbsp;to the midrib. They appear in June ; and the female&nbsp;flowers are ſucceeded by benies as large as cherries, of&nbsp;a ſweetiſh taſte, which ripen in winter j when they are&nbsp;of a beautiful red colour. As this plant grows wild in&nbsp;moſt parts of England, it is rarely admitted into gardens ; but if ſome of the roots are planted under tall&nbsp;trees in large plantations, they will ſpread into large&nbsp;clumps ; and as they retain their leaves in winter, at&nbsp;that ſeaſon they will have a good effect. The ſeeds of&nbsp;this plant generally lie a year in the ground before they&nbsp;vegetate ; and the plants ſo raiſed are long before they&nbsp;arrive at a fize big enough to make any figure, and&nbsp;therefore it is much better to tranſplant the roots.—&nbsp;The root of this plant is accounted aperient, and in this&nbsp;intention is ſometimes made an ingredient in apozems&nbsp;and diet-drinks, ſor opening flight obſtructions of the&nbsp;viſcera and promoting the fluid ſecretions. This plant&nbsp;is uſed by the butchers for beſoms to ſweep their blocks.&nbsp;Huckſters place the boughs round their bacon and&nbsp;cheeſe to defend them from the mice ; for they cannot&nbsp;make their way through the prickly leaves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUSHWORTH (John), the compiler of ſome uſeful collections reſpecting the affairs of ſtate, was born in Northumberland about the year 1607, and was de-ſcended of honourable anceſtors. After attending the&nbsp;univerſity of Oxford for ſome time, he removed to&nbsp;Lincoln’s Inn ; but the ſtudy of law not ſuiting his genius, he ſoon deſerted it, in order to ſeek a ſituation&nbsp;where he might more eaſily gratify his love for political information. He frequented the meetings of parliament, and wrote down the ſpeeches both of the king&nbsp;and members. During the ſpace of 11 years, From&nbsp;1630 to 1640, when no parliament was held, he was an&nbsp;attentive obſerver of the great tranſactions of ſtate in&nbsp;the ſtar-chamber, the court of honour, and exchequer&nbsp;chamber, when all the judges of England aſſembled&nbsp;there on caſes of great emergency. Nor did he neglect to obſerve with a watchful eye thoſe events which&nbsp;happened at a diſtance from the capital. He vilited&nbsp;the camp at Berwick, was preſent at the battle of Newborn, at the treaty of Rippon, and at the great council&nbsp;of York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1640 he was appointed aſſiſtant to Henry Elſynge clerk to the houſe of commons, and thus had the beſt&nbsp;opportunities of being acquainted with their debates and&nbsp;proceedings. The commons conſidered him as a perſon worthy of confidence. In particular, they truſted&nbsp;him with carrying their meffages to the king while he&nbsp;remained at York. And when the parliament created&nbsp;Sir Thomas Fairfax their general, Ruſhworth was appointed his ſecretary, and diſcharged the office much&nbsp;to the advantage of his maſter. When Fairfax reſign-ed his commiſſion, his ſecretary returned to Lincoln’s&nbsp;Inn, and was ſoon after (in 1651-2) choſen one of the&nbsp;committee that was appointed to deliberate concerning&nbsp;the propriety and means oſ altering or new-modelling&nbsp;the common law. He was elected one of the repre-fentatives for Berwick upon Tweed to the parliament&nbsp;which Richard Cromwell aſſembled in 1658, and was&nbsp;re-elected by the ſame town to the parliament which reſtored Charles II. to the crown.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">Aſter the Reſtoration, he delivered to the king ſeve-</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
