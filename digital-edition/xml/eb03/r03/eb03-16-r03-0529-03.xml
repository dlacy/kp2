<p><label>ROUNDS</label>
in military matters, a detachment from the main-guard, of an officer or a non-commiſſioned officer and fix men, who go round the rampart oſ a garriſon, to liſten if any thing be ſtirring without the place, and to ſee that the centinels be diligent upon their duty, and^all in order. In ſtrict garriſons the rounds go every half-hour. The centinels are to challenge at a diſtance, and to reſt their arms as the round paffes. All guards turn out, challenge, exchange the parole, and reſt their arms, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rounds are ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary rounds are three ; the town-major’s round, the grand-round, and the viſiting-round.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Manner oſ going the Rounds.</hi> When the town-major goes his round, he comes to the main guard, and demands a ſerjeant and four or ſix men to eſcort him to the next guard ; and when it is dark, one of the men is to carry a light.</p><p>As ſoon as the ſentry at the guard perceives the round comi⅞g, he ſhall give notice to the guard, that they may be ready to turn out when order ed ; and when the round is advanced within about 20 or 30 paces of the guard, he is to challenge briſkly ; and when he is anſwered by the ſerjeant who attends the round, <hi rend="italic">Town major's round,</hi> he is to ſay, <hi rend="italic">Stand round!</hi> and reſt his arms ; after which he is to call out immediately, <hi rend="italic">Serjeant turn out the guard, towη-maj∙ Ls round.</hi> Upon the ſentry calling, the ſerjeant is to turn out the guard immediately, drawing up the men in good or der with ſhouldered arms, the officer placing himſelf at the head of it, with his arms in his hand. He then orders the ſerjeant and four or ſix men to advance toward the round, and challenge : the ſerjeant of the round is to anſwer, <hi rend="italic">Town-major's round ;</hi> upon which the ſerjeant of the guard replies, <hi rend="italic">AHvan <hi rend="sub">l</hi> ∣, Je&gt;jeant, with the parole !</hi> at the ſame time ordering his men to . reſt their arms. The ſerjeant of the round advances •alone, and gives the ſerjeant of the guard the parole in his car, that nene elſe may hear it ; during which period the ſerjeant of the guard holds the ſpear of his halbert at the other’s breaſt. The ſerjeant of the round then returns to his poll, whilſt the ſerjeant of the guard leaving his men to keep the round from advancing, gives the parole to his officer. This being found right, the officer orders his ſerjeant to return to his men ; ſays, <hi rend="italic">Advance, town-major's round!</hi> and orders the gμard to reſt their arms ; upon which the ſerjeant of the guard orders his men to wheel back from the centre, and form a lane, through which the town-major is to paſs (the eſcort remaining where they were), and go up to the officer and give him the parole, laying his mouth to his ear. The officer holds the ſpear of his efponton at the town major’s breaſt while he gives him the parole.</p><p>The deſign of rounds is not only to vifιt the guards, and keep the centinels alert ; but likewiſe to diſcover what pa(Γes in the outworks, and beyond them.</p>
