        <p><span class="font1">re-establishment on a legal basis of the ascendency which custom had
                so long accorded to the senate was his main&nbsp;object. With this purpose he had
                already, when consul&nbsp;in 88, made the “senatus auctoritas” legally
                necessary&nbsp;for proposals to the assembly. He now as
                dictator@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>followed this up by crippling the power of the
                magistracy,&nbsp;which had been the most effective weapon in the hands of&nbsp;the
                senate’s opponents. The legislative freedom of the&nbsp;tribunes was already
                hampered by the necessity of obtaining the senate’s sanction ; in addition, Sulla
                restricted their&nbsp;wide powers of interference (intercessio) to their
                original&nbsp;purpose of protecting individual plebeians,@@<sup>2</sup> and
                discredited&nbsp;the office by prohibiting a tribune from holding any subsequent
                office in the state.@@<sup>3</sup> The control of the courts&nbsp;(quaestiones
                perpetuae) was taken from the equestrian order&nbsp;and restored to the
                    senate.@@<sup>4</sup> To prevent the people from&nbsp;suddenly installing and
                keeping in high office a second&nbsp;Marius, he re-enacted the old law against
                    re-election,@@<sup>5</sup> and&nbsp;made legally binding the custom which
                required a man&nbsp;to mount up gradually to the consulship through the&nbsp;lower
                    offices.@@<sup>6</sup> His increase of the number of prætors&nbsp;from six to
                    eight,@@<sup>7</sup> and of quæstors to twenty,@@<sup>8</sup>
                though&nbsp;required by administrative necessities, tended, by enlarging&nbsp;the
                numbers and further dividing the authority of the&nbsp;magistrates, to render them
                still more dependent upon the&nbsp;central direction of the senate. Lastly, he
                replaced the&nbsp;pontifical and augural colleges in the hands of the senatorial
                nobles, by enacting that vacancies in them should,&nbsp;as before the lex Domitia
                (104), be filled up by co-optation.@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>This policy of deliberately
                altering the constitution, so as&nbsp;to make it pronounce in favour of his own
                party, was&nbsp;open to two grave objections. It was not to be expected&nbsp;that
                the new legal safeguards would protect the senate&nbsp;any more efficiently than the
                established custom and tradition which the Gracchi had broken down ; and,
                secondly,&nbsp;it was inevitable that the popular party would on the
                first&nbsp;opportunity follow Sulla’s example, and alter the constitution to suit
                themselves. Still less was Sulla successful in fortifying the republican system
                against the dangers&nbsp;which menaced it from without. He accepted as
                an&nbsp;accomplished fact the enfranchisement of the
                Italians,@@<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>but he made no provision to guard against the
                consequent&nbsp;reduction of the comitia to an absurdity, and with them&nbsp;of the
                civic government which rested upon them, or to&nbsp;organize an effective
                administrative system for the Italian&nbsp;communities.@@<sup>11</sup> Of all men,
                too, Sulla had the best reason</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">to appreciate the dangers to be feared from the growing independence
                of governors and generals in the provinces,&nbsp;and from the transformation of the
                old civic militia into&nbsp;a group of professional armies, devoted only to a
                successful&nbsp;leader, and with the weakest possible sense of allegiance&nbsp;to
                the state. He had himself, as proconsul of Asia, contemptuously and successfully
                defied the home government,&nbsp;and he, more than any other Roman general, had
                taught&nbsp;his soldiers to look only to their leader, and to think only&nbsp;of
                    booty.<sup>12</sup> Yet, beyond a few inadequate regulations, there&nbsp;is no
                evidence that Sulla dealt with these burning questions, the settlement of which was
                among the greatest of&nbsp;the achievements of Augustus.<sup>13</sup> One
                administrative reform of real importance must, lastly, be set down to
                his&nbsp;credit. The judicial procedure first established in 149&nbsp;for the trial
                of cases of magisterial extortion in the provinces, and applied between 149 and 81
                to cases of treason&nbsp;and bribery, Sulla extended so as to bring under it
                the&nbsp;chief criminal offences, and thus laid the foundations of&nbsp;the Roman
                criminal law.<sup>14</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Sullan system stood for nine years, and was then overthrown—as it
                had been established—by a successful&nbsp;soldier. It was the fortune of Cn.
                Pompeius, a favourite&nbsp;officer of Sulla, first of all to violate in his own
                person the&nbsp;fundamental principles of the constitution re-established&nbsp;by
                his old chief, and then to overturn it. In Spain the&nbsp;Marian governor Q.
                Sertorius (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Sertorius)</span><span class="font1"> had defeated&nbsp;one after another of the
                proconsuls sent out by the senate,&nbsp;and was already in 77 master of all Hither
                    Spain.<sup>15</sup> To&nbsp;meet the crisis, the senate itself took a step which
                was&nbsp;in fact the plainest possible confession that the system&nbsp;sanctioned
                afresh by Sulla was inadequate to the needs&nbsp;of the state. Pompey, who was not
                yet thirty, and had&nbsp;never held even the quæstorship, was sent out to
                Spain&nbsp;with proconsular authority.<sup>16</sup> Still Sertorius held
                out,&nbsp;until in 73 he was foully murdered by his own officers.&nbsp;The native
                tribes who had loyally stood by him submitted,&nbsp;and Pompey early in 71 returned
                with his troops to Italy,&nbsp;where, during his absence in Spain, an event had
                occurred&nbsp;which had shown Roman society with startling plainness&nbsp;how near
                it stood to revolution. In 73 Spartacus,<sup>17</sup> a&nbsp;Thracian slave, escaped
                with seventy others from a gladiators’ training school at Capua. In an incredibly
                short&nbsp;time he found himself at the head of a numerous force</span></p>

                a provision which increased rather than diminished his freedom of action ; (2) that

                a&nbsp;definition of treason evidently framed in the light of recent

                laws&nbsp;dealing with extortion in the provinces. But the danger lay, not
                in&nbsp;the want of laws, but in the want of security for their observance
                by&nbsp;an absolutely autocratic proconsul. The present writer cannot
                agree&nbsp;with those who would include among Sulla’s laws one retaining
                consuls&nbsp;and prætors in Rome for their year of office and then sending them
                out&nbsp;to a province. This was becoming the common practice before 81.&nbsp;After
                81 it is invariable for prætors, as needed for the judicial work,&nbsp;and
                invariable but for two exceptions in the case of consuls ; but&nbsp;nowhere is there
                a hint that there had been any legislation on the&nbsp;subject, and there are
                indications that it was convenience and not law&nbsp;which maintained the
