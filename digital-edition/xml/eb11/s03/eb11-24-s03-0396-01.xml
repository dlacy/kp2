Besides a stately 18th century parish church and several convents, it contains a 16th century town hall (housing various precious MSS. and banners captured in various wars), as well as several curious old patrician houses, such as that of the Reding family, a member of which, Aloys (1765-1818), headed the patriotic resistance toâˆ£the French in 1798-1799. Including the neighbouring hamlets of Ibach, Rickenbach, &amp;amp;c., the parish had 7398 inhabitants in 1900, practically all German-speaking and Romanists. The town is connected by an electric tramway with the Schwyz-Seewen station on the St Gotthard railway, about 3 m. from Brunnen, the port of Schwyz on the lake of Lucerne.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
