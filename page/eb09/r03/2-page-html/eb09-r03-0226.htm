<p><span class="font0">RUBENS, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peter Paul</span><span class="font0"> (1577-1610), the most eminent representative of Flemish art, and one of the greatest&nbsp;painters of any school, was born very probably at Siegen,&nbsp;in Westphalia, on the 29th of June 1577. Till some&nbsp;thirty years ago Cologne might still claim the honour of&nbsp;having been the master’s birthplace ; the Rhenish city is&nbsp;mentioned by Rubens himself, in one of his letters, as&nbsp;closely connected with his childhood, and through his&nbsp;father’s epitaph we learn that for more than nineteen&nbsp;years Cologne was the family’s place of refuge amid the&nbsp;disturbances prevailing in the Low Countries. This,&nbsp;however, has been proved to be but part of the truth, and,&nbsp;if Rubens’s parents certainly during several years did live&nbsp;at Cologne, they also resided elsewhere, and that for&nbsp;reasons so strong that both wife and husband might well&nbsp;desire to see them for ever buried in secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although of humble descent,—his father was a druggist, —John Rubens was a man of learning. He had studied&nbsp;law at home and abroad, and became councillor and alderman in his native town (1562). A Catholic by birth, it was&nbsp;not long before he became, like many of his countrymen, a&nbsp;zealous upholder of the Reformation, and we even find him&nbsp;spoken of by a contemporary as “le plus docte Calviniste&nbsp;qui fust pour lors au Bas Pays.” After the plundering of&nbsp;the Antwerp churches in 1566, the magistrates were called&nbsp;upon for a justification. While openly they declared&nbsp;themselves devoted sons of the church, a list of the&nbsp;followers of the Reformed creed, headed by the name of&nbsp;Anthony Van Stralen, the burgomaster, got into the hands&nbsp;of the duke of Alva. This was a sentence of death for the&nbsp;magistrates, and John Rubens lost no time in quitting&nbsp;Spanish soil, ultimately settling at Cologne (October&nbsp;1568), with lιis wife and four children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his new residence he became legal adviser to Anne of Saxony, the second wife of the prince of Orange,&nbsp;William the Silent. Before long it was discovered that&nbsp;their relations were not purely of a business kind. Thrown&nbsp;into the dungeons of Dillenburg, Rubens lingered there for&nbsp;many months, his wife, Maria Pypelincx, never relaxing&nbsp;her endeavours to get the undutiful husband restored to&nbsp;freedom. Two years elapsed before the prisoner was&nbsp;released, and then only to be confined to the small town&nbsp;of Siegen. Here he lived with his family, from 1573 to&nbsp;1578, and here most probably Maria Pypelincx gave birth&nbsp;to Philip, afterwards town-clerk of Antwerp, and Peter&nbsp;Paul. A year after (May 1578) the Antwerp lawyer got&nbsp;leave to return to Cologne, where he died on the 18th of&nbsp;March 1587, after having, it is said, returned to Catholicism. As there are at Siegen no records going back to&nbsp;the 16th century, the facts relating to the birth of Peter&nbsp;Paul Rubens must, of course, remain conjectural, but his&nbsp;mother certainly was at Siegen a few days before his birth,&nbsp;for we find her there, petitioning in favour of John Rubens,&nbsp;on June 14, 1577.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens went to Antwerp with his mother when he was scarcely ten years of age, and made good progress in his&nbsp;classical studies, which he had begun with the Jesuits at&nbsp;Cologne. An excellent Latin scholar, he was also proficient in French, Italian, English, German, and Dutch.&nbsp;Part of his boyhood he spent as a page in the household of&nbsp;the countess of Lalaing, in Brussels ; but, tradition adds,&nbsp;and we may well believe, the youth’s disposition was such&nbsp;as to induce his mother to allow him to follow his proper&nbsp;vocation, choosing as his master Tobias Verhaecht, who&nbsp;was in some way connected with the family. Not the&nbsp;slightest trace of this first master’s influence can be detected&nbsp;in Rubens’s works. Not so with Adam Van Noort, to&nbsp;whom the young man was next apprenticed. Van Noort,&nbsp;whose aspect of energy is well known through Van Dyck’s&nbsp;beautiful etching, was the highly esteemed master of numerous painters,—among them Van Balen, Sebastian Vrancx,&nbsp;and Jordaens, later his son-in-law. His pictures are almost&nbsp;exclusively to be found in Antwerp churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens remained with Van Noort for the usual period of four years, thereafter studying under Otto Vœnius or&nbsp;Van Veen, a gentleman by birth, a most distinguished&nbsp;Latin scholar, and a painter of very high repute. He was&nbsp;a native of Leyden, and only recently settled in Antwerp,&nbsp;but the town gave him numerous commissions of importance. Though Rubens never adopted his style of painting,&nbsp;the tastes of master and pupil had much in common, and&nbsp;some pictures by Otto Vœnius can be pointed out as having&nbsp;inspired Rubens at a more advanced period. For example,&nbsp;the Magdalene anointing Christ’s Feet, painted for the&nbsp;cathedral at Malaga, and now at the Hermitage in St&nbsp;Petersburg, closely resembles in composition the very important work of Otto Vœnius in the church at Bergues near&nbsp;Dunkirk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1598, Adam Van Noort acting as dean of the Antwerp guild of painters, Rubens was officially recognized as “ master,”—that is, was allowed to work independently&nbsp;and receive pupils. We have no means of forming an&nbsp;idea of his style at this early period, two years before his&nbsp;journey to Italy, but even the somewhat later works found&nbsp;at Genoa, Mantua, and Rome differ considerably from&nbsp;what may be termed the Rubenesque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From 1600 to the latter part of 1608 Rubens belonged to the household of Vincenzo Gonzaga, duke of Mantua.&nbsp;Few princes in Italy surpassed the Gonzagas in splendour.&nbsp;For them Mantegna, Giulio Romano, Titian, and Prima-ticcio had produced some of their most admired works,&nbsp;and their now deserted palaces still bear traces of the&nbsp;richest decoration. To the Mantuan collection the Pitti&nbsp;palace, the Louvre, and the royal galleries of England owe&nbsp;some of their noblest specimens of Italian art. How&nbsp;Rubens came to be engaged at Mantua has not been&nbsp;explained. The duke, it is known, spent some time at&nbsp;Venice in July 1600, and is supposed there to have met his&nbsp;future painter, but it is also to be remembered that another&nbsp;Fleming, Francis Pourbus the younger, was at the time&nbsp;employed by him in taking the likeness of the prettiest&nbsp;women of the day ; and Rubens, much against his will,&nbsp;was also, at first, it seems, intrusted with a similar task.&nbsp;The influence of the master’s stay at Mantua was of&nbsp;extreme importance, and cannot be too constantly kept in&nbsp;view in the study of his later works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sent to Rome in 1601, to take copies from Raphael for his master, he was also commissioned to paint several&nbsp;pictures for the church of Santa Croce, by the archduke&nbsp;Albert of Austria, sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands,&nbsp;and once, when he was a cardinal, the titular of that see.&nbsp;A copy of Mercury and Psyche after Raphael is preserved&nbsp;in the museum at Pesth. The religious paintings—the&nbsp;Invention of the Cross, the Crowning with Thorns, and&nbsp;the Crucifixion—are to be found in the hospital at Grasse&nbsp;in Provence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the beginning of 1603 “The Fleming,” as he was termed at Mantua, was sent to Spain with a variety of&nbsp;presents for Philip III. and his minister the duke of&nbsp;Lerma, and thus had opportunity to spend a whole year&nbsp;at Madrid and become acquainted with some of Titian’s&nbsp;masterpieces. Two of his own works, known to belong to&nbsp;the same period, are in the Madrid Gallery, Heraclitus&nbsp;and Democritus. Of Rubens’s abilities so far back as&nbsp;1604 we get a more complete idea from an immense&nbsp;picture now in the Antwerp Gallery, the Baptism of Our&nbsp;Lord, originally painted for the Jesuits at Mantua. Here&nbsp;it may be seen to what degree Italian surroundings had</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
