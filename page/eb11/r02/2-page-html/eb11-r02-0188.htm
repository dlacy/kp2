<p><span class="font2">in 1854; and in 1858 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sacunlala,</span><span class="font2"> a ballet, at the Opéra. It was the production of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Stalue</span><span class="font2"> at the Théâtre lyrique in 1861 that&nbsp;brought Reyer’s name prominently before the public. But’&nbsp;Reyer had to wait several years before obtaining a real and&nbsp;permanent success. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erostrate,</span><span class="font2"> an opera produced at Baden-Baden in 1862, and given at the Paris Opéra some ten years&nbsp;later, was a failure. The composer had in the meanwhile set to&nbsp;work on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sigurd,</span><span class="font2"> the subject of which is the same that inspired&nbsp;Wagner in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Siegfried</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Götterdämmerung.</span><span class="font2"> It was at last&nbsp;produced in Brussels in 1884, and subsequently brought out at&nbsp;the Paris Opéra. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sigurd</span><span class="font2"> is a work of great value, displaying its&nbsp;composer’s .elevated notions as regards the form of the “ lyrical&nbsp;drama.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salamrnbb,</span><span class="font2"> founded upon Flaubert’s romance, was&nbsp;successfully produced at Brussels in 1890. Gluck, Weber,&nbsp;Berlioz and Wagner exercised' most influence over Reyer. As a&nbsp;musical critic (preceding Berlioz in that capacity for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal&nbsp;des débats)</span><span class="font2"> Reyer was a well-known writer; and he became&nbsp;librarian of the Paris Opéra, and a member of the Institute.&nbsp;His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quarante Ans de musique</span><span class="font2"> (with biographical notice by&nbsp;E. Henriot) was published in 1909.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REYNARD THE FOX, a beast-epic, current in French, Dutch and German literature. The cycle of animal stories&nbsp;collected round the names of Reynard the Fox and Isengrim&nbsp;the Wolf in the 12th century seems to have arisen on the borderland of France and Flanders. Much of the material may be&nbsp;found in Aesop, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Physiologus,</span><span class="font2"> and in the 12th-century </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Disciplina&nbsp;Clericalis</span><span class="font2"> of Petrus Alfonsus. But the difference is very great.&nbsp;The intention of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Irouveres</span><span class="font2"> who recited the exploits of Reynard&nbsp;was, in the earlier stages, in no sense didactic. The tales, like&nbsp;those of <sup>U</sup> Uncle Remus,” were amusing in themselves; they&nbsp;were based on widely diffused folklore, and Reynard and his&nbsp;companions were not originally men disguised as animals.&nbsp;Jacob Grimm </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Reinhart Fuchs,</span><span class="font2"> 1834) maintained their popular&nbsp;origin; his theories, which have been much contested, have&nbsp;received additional support from the researches of K. Krohn,&nbsp;who discovered many of the stories most characteristic of the&nbsp;cycle in existing Finnish folklore, where they can hardly have&nbsp;arrived through learned channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is abundant evidence that Isengrim and Reynard were firmly established in the popular imagination in the 13th century,&nbsp;and even earlier. Guibert de Nogent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(De Vita sua,</span><span class="font2"> book 3, chap, viii.,&nbsp;printed Paris, 1651), in referring to the disturbances at Laon&nbsp;in 1112, says that the bishop Gaudri was accustomed to call&nbsp;one of his enemies Isengrim, and it is obvious from the context&nbsp;that the taunt was perfectly understood by the popular mind.&nbsp;Philip the Fair is said to have annoyed Pope Boniface III.,&nbsp;who died in 1303,.by the representation of the “Procession&nbsp;Renart ”; and in 1204-1206 in Flanders two opposing parties&nbsp;were designated Isangrini and Blavotini (blue-footed). The&nbsp;principal names of the Reynard cycle, and the earliest in use,&nbsp;were German. Reynard himself (Raginohardus, strong in&nbsp;counsel), Bruin the Bear, Baldwin the Ass, Tibert the Cat,&nbsp;Hirsent the She-wolf, had German names, most of which were&nbsp;used as person-names in Lorraine. Whatever the sources of the&nbsp;stories, it was in France that the cycle obtained its greatest&nbsp;vogue. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Renart</span><span class="font2"> as printed by Méon (Paris,&nbsp;4 vols., 1826) runs to over 40,000 lines, and contains a great&nbsp;number of detached episodes or branches, to which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Irouveres&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">gave a certain unity by attaching them to the traditionary&nbsp;feud between Reynard and Isengrim. This rapidly became&nbsp;symbolic of the triumph of craft and eloquence over brute&nbsp;strength. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Renart</span><span class="font2"> was a popular epic parodying feudal institutions as represented in the romances of chivalry, and readily&nbsp;adapting itself to satire of the rich, of the forms of justice, and&nbsp;of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The early French originals are lost, the most ancient existing fragments being in Latin. The fable of the lion’s sickness and&nbsp;his cure by the wolf’s skin occurs in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ecbasis cujusdam captivi&nbsp;per Tropologiam</span><span class="font2"> (ed. E. Voigt; Strassburg, 1875), written by a&nbsp;monk of St Evre at Toul (Meurthe-et-Moselle) about 940.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vsengrimus</span><span class="font2"> (ed. E. Voigt; Halle, 1884), a clerical satire&nbsp;written by Nivard of Ghent about 1148, includes the story of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the lion’s sickness and the pilgrimage of BertiIiana the Goat. Another Latin poem, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reinardus vulpes</span><span class="font2"> (ed. F. J. Mone; Stuttgart, 1832), contains in addition the theft of. the bacon, and how&nbsp;Isengrim is induced to fish with his tail. A simpler version,&nbsp;derived probably from a French original, is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Isingrines nôt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">written in German about 1180 by the Alsatian Heinrich der&nbsp;Glichezäre. Only fragments of this poem are preserved, but&nbsp;about a quarter of a century later it was re-written with little&nbsp;change in the subject matter as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reinhart Fuchs</span><span class="font2"> (ed. J. Grimm,&nbsp;Berlin, 1834; and K. Reissenberger, Halle, 1886). AIost later&nbsp;versions of Reynard have been derived, however, from the&nbsp;Flemish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reinaert de vos</span><span class="font2"> (ed. J. F. Willems, Ghent, 1836; and&nbsp;E. Martin, Paderborn, 1874), written about 1250 in East Flanders&nbsp;by Willem. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reinaert</span><span class="font2"> is a poem of 3474 lines. The corresponding&nbsp;branch of the French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Renart</span><span class="font2"> (for which and its satirical&nbsp;sequels, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Couronnement Renart, Renart le nouveau,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Renart&nbsp;le contrefait,</span><span class="font2"> see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">French Literature)</span><span class="font2"> is one of the earliest and&nbsp;best of the great French cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fable was, like other French works, known in England, but did not at once pass into the popular stock. Odo of Cheriton<sub>5&nbsp;</sub>who died in 1247, used the Reynard stories in his sermons, and&nbsp;many of them occur in his collection of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parabolae</span><span class="font2"> (ed. Hervieux,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fabulistes latins,</span><span class="font2"> 1884, vol. i.). The English poem of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vox&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">and the Wolf</span><span class="font2"> dates from the 13th century; and the “ Nonne&nbsp;Preestes Tale ” of Chaucer, in which, however, the fox is Rossel&nbsp;and the ass Brunel, is a genuine Reynard history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Willem’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reinaert de Vos</span><span class="font2"> was left incomplete, and the continuation—about 4000 lines in a more didactic vein—was added by an unknown writer of West Flanders about 1370. The first&nbsp;copy printed in any language was the Dutch prose version,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hystorie van Reynaert de Vos,</span><span class="font2"> printed at Gouda by Gheraert&nbsp;Leeuw in 1479. On this Caxton based his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historye of reynart&nbsp;the foxe</span><span class="font2"> (reprinted by E. Arber, 1878), which he finished on the&nbsp;6th of June 1481. As a satire on the church, especially on&nbsp;monks and nuns, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reynard</span><span class="font2"> became popular with reformers, and&nbsp;numerous versions followed in England and Germany. A Low&nbsp;German version, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reineke Fuchs,</span><span class="font2"> with a prose commentary by&nbsp;Hinrek Alckmer (Henry of Alkmaar), was issued from the&nbsp;Antwerp press of Gheraert Leeuw in 1487. From this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rifaci-mento</span><span class="font2"> was derived the Low German </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reynke de Vos</span><span class="font2"> (ed. Hoffmann&nbsp;von Fallersleben, Breslau, 1834; and Friedrich Prien, Halle,&nbsp;1887), which was printed at Lübeck in 1498. Michael Beuther&nbsp;is said to have been the translator into High German </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Reiniken&nbsp;Fuchs,</span><span class="font2"> 1544) ; and the book was made available to the general&nbsp;European public in the Latin version of Hartmann Schopper,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Poeticum de admirabilifallacia et astutia Vulpeculae Reinikes&nbsp;Libros quatuor</span><span class="font2"> (Frankfort, 1567). The modern German version&nbsp;(1794) of Goethe has been often reprinted, notably in 1846 with&nbsp;illustrations by Wilhelm von Kaulbach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reynard is dealt with by Carlyle in an essay “ On German Literature of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries ” in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Quarterly Review</span><span class="font1"> (1831). An admirable, account of the&nbsp;Reynard cycle is given by W. J. Thoms in his edition of Caxton’s&nbsp;version for the Percy Society (1844). Prien’s edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reynke&nbsp;de Vos</span><span class="font1"> contains bibliographical particulars of the German, Danish,&nbsp;Swedish, Icelandic and English editions (cp. Brunet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manuel du&nbsp;libraire, s.v.</span><span class="font1"> Renart). The best edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman de Renart &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is by Ernest Martin (3 vols., Strassburg and Paris, 1881-1887).</span></p>
