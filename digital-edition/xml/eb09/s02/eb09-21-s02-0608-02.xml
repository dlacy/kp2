The belief in enormous serpents, both terrestrial and marine, dates from very early times. Pliny (<hi rend="italic">H.N</hi>., viii. 14), following Livy <hi rend="italic">(Epic,</hi> xviii.), tells us of a land-serpent 120 feet long, which Regulus and his army besieged with balistæ, as though it had been a city, and this story is repeated by several other writers (Florus, ii. 2 ; Val. Max., i. 8 ; Gellius, vi. 3). The most prolific in accounts of the sea-serpent, however, are the early Norse writers, to whom the “ Sö-Orm ” was a subject both for prose and verse. Olaus Magnus <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Gent. Sept.,</hi> xxi. 24) describes it as 200 feet long and 20 feet round, and states that it not only ate calves, sheep, and swine, but also “ disturbs ships, rising up like a mast, and sometimes snaps some of the men from the deck,” illustrating his account with a vivid representation of the animal in the very act. Pontoppidan, in his <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> (Eng. tr., 1755, p. 195 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> says that its existence was generally believed in by the sailors and fishermen of his time, and recounts the means they adopted to escape it, as well as many details regarding the habits of the creature. The more circumstantial records of comparatively modern times may be most conveniently grouped according to the causes which presumably gave rise to the phenomena described. (1) A number of porpoises swimming one behind another may, by their characteristic mode of half emerging from and then re-entering the water during respiration, produce the appearance of a single animal showing a succession of snake-like undulations. The figure given by Pontoppidan was very likely suggested by such an appearance, and a sketch of an animal seen off Llandudno by several observers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Mott, <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> xxvii. pp. 293, 315, 338 ; also <hi rend="italic">Land and Water,</hi> September 1872. </note> looks as though it might have had a similar origin, notwithstanding that this hypothesis was rejected by them. (2) A flight of sea-fowl on one occasion recorded by Professor Aldis<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> ibid.; also Drew, in vol. xviii. p. 489 ; Bird, <hi rend="italic">tom. cit.,p.</hi> 519 ; Ingleby, <hi rend="italic">tom. cit.,</hi> p. 541. </note> produced the appearance of a snake swimming at the surface of the water. (3) A large mass of seaweed has on more than one occasion been cautiously approached and even harpooned under the impression that it was such a monster.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> F. Smith, <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> February 1858 ; Herriman, quoted by Gosse, <hi rend="italic">op. cit. postea,</hi> p. 338 ; Pringle, <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> xviii. p. 519, 1878. </note> (4) A pair of basking sharks <hi rend="italic">(Selache maxima)</hi> furnish an explanation of some of the recorded observations, as was first pointed out by Frank Buckland. These fish have a habit of swimming</p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s02-0609" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0635.jp2"/><p>in pairs, one following the other with the dorsal fin and the upper lobe of the tail just appearing above the water, and, as each animal is fully 30 feet long, the effect of a body of 60 or more feet long moving through the water is readily produced. To this category belongs the famous serpent cast up on Stτonsay, one of the Orkneys, of which an account was read to the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> <hi rend="italic">Mem.
