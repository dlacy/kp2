                the&nbsp;mistress of the robes to the maids of honour are in her&nbsp;service. At
                the commencement of the reign of Queen&nbsp;Victoria the two establishments were
                combined, and on&nbsp;the whole considerably reduced. Hence the royal household,
                although it is of course much larger than that of a&nbsp;queen consort would be, is
                also appreciably smaller than&nbsp;that of a king and queen consort together has

                department. The&nbsp;lord steward is the first dignitary of the court, and presides
                at the&nbsp;Board of Green Cloth, where all the accounts of the household
                are&nbsp;examined and passed.@@<sup>2</sup> He is always a member of the Government
                of the day, a peer, and a privy councillor. He receives his&nbsp;appointment from
                the sovereign in person, and bears a white staff&nbsp;as the emblem and warrant of
                his authority.@@<sup>3</sup> In his department&nbsp;the treasurer and comptroller of
                the household are the officers&nbsp;next in rank to him. They also sit at the Board
                of Green Cloth,&nbsp;carry white staves, and belong to the ministry. They are
                always&nbsp;peers or the sons of peers, and privy councillors. But the
                duties&nbsp;which in theory belong to the lord steward, treasurer, and comptroller
                of the household are in practice performed by the master&nbsp;of the household, who
                is a permanent officer and resides in the&nbsp;palace. It is he who really
                investigates the accounts and maintains discipline among the ordinary servants of
                the royal establishment. He is a white-staff officer and a member of the
                Board&nbsp;of Green Cloth but not of the ministry, and among other things&nbsp;he
                presides at the daily dinners of the suite in waiting on

                metropolitan&nbsp;theatres, and the chapels royal are in the lord chamberlain’s
                department. The lord chamberlain is the second dignitary of the court,&nbsp;and is
                always a member of the Government of the day, a peer, and a&nbsp;privy councillor.
                He carnes a white staff, and wears a golden or&nbsp;jewelled key, typical of the key
                of the palace, which is supposed to&nbsp;be in his charge, as the ensigns of his
                office. He is responsible for&nbsp;the necessary arrangements connected with state
                ceremonies, such&nbsp;as coronations and royal marriages, christenings, and
                funerals. All&nbsp;invitations to court are sent out in his name by command of
                the&nbsp;sovereign, and at drawing rooms and levees he stands next to
                the&nbsp;sovereign and announces the persons who are approaching the&nbsp;throne. It
                is also part of his duty to conduct the sovereign to and&nbsp;from his or her
                    carriage.@@<sup>7</sup> The vice-chamberlain of the household&nbsp;is the lord
                chamberlain’s assistant and deputy. He also is one of&nbsp;the ministry, a
                white-staff officer, and the bearer of a key; and he is&nbsp;always a peer or the
                son of a peer as well as a privy councillor.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">When there is a king the groom of the stole comes next to the
                vice-chamberlain in rank and authority. At present, however, the&nbsp;mistress of
                the robes in some measure occupies the position of the&nbsp;groom of the
                    stole.@@<sup>8</sup> She is the only lady of the court who comes&nbsp;into
                office and goes out with the administration, and the duties&nbsp;she performs are
                merely occasional and formal. She is always&nbsp;a duchess, and attends the queen at
                all state ceremonies and entertainments, but is never in permanent residence at the
                    palace.@@<sup>9</sup> On&nbsp;the contrary the ladies of the bedchamber share
                the function of&nbsp;personal attendance on the sovereign throughout the year.
                Of&nbsp;these there are eight, always peeresses, and each is in waiting
                for&nbsp;about a fortnight or three λveeks at a time. But the women of
                the&nbsp;bedchamber, of whom there are also eight, appear only at
                court&nbsp;ceremonies and entertainments according to a roster annually&nbsp;issued
                under the authority of the lord chamberlain. They are&nbsp;usually the daughters of
                peers or the wives of the sons of peers, and&nbsp;in the old time, like the mistress
                of the robes and the ladies of the&nbsp;bedchamber, habitually assisted the queen at
                her daily toilette.&nbsp;But this has long ceased to be done by any of them. The
                maids&nbsp;of honour, whose situations are by no means sinecures, are likewise eight
                in number and have the same terms of waiting as the&nbsp;ladies of the bedchamber.
                They are commonly if not always the&nbsp;daughters Orgranddaughtersof peers, and
                when they have no superior&nbsp;title and precedence by birth are called “
                honourable ” and placed&nbsp;next after the daughters of barons. The queen as a
                special mark of&nbsp;Iierfavour nominates “extra” ladies and women of the
                bed-chamber&nbsp;and maids of honour. But their position is altogether
                honorary&nbsp;and involves no charge on the civil list. There are eight
                lords&nbsp;and eight grooms, who are properly described as “ of the bedchamber” or
                “in waiting,” according as the reigning sovereign is&nbsp;a king or a queen, and
                whose terms of attendance are of similar&nbsp;duration to those of the ladies of the
                bedchamber and the maids&nbsp;of honour. Occasionally “extra” lords and grooms in
                waiting&nbsp;are nominated by the queen, who, however, are unpaid and have&nbsp;no
                regular duties. The master, assistant master, and marshal of&nbsp;the ceremonies are
                the officers whose special function it is to&nbsp;enforce the observance of the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">etiquette</span><span
                class="font1"> of the court. The reception&nbsp;of foreign potentates and
                ambassadors is under their particular&nbsp;care, and they assist in the ordering of
                all entertainments and&nbsp;festivities at the palace.@@<sup>10</sup> The gentleman
                usher of the black&nbsp;rod—the black rod which he carries being the ensign of
                his&nbsp;office—is the principal usher of the court and kingdom. He is&nbsp;one of
                the original functionaries of the order of the Garter, and&nbsp;is in constant
                attendance on the House of Lords, from whom,&nbsp;either personally or by his deputy
                the yeoman usher of the black&nbsp;rod, it is part of his duty to carry messages and
                summonses to the&nbsp;House of Commons. The gentlemen ushers of the privy
                chamber&nbsp;and the gentlemen ushers daily waiters, of whom there are four
                each,&nbsp;and the gentlemen ushers quarterly waiters and the sergeants-at-arms, of
                whom there are eight each, are in waiting only at drawing&nbsp;rooms and levees and
                state balls and concerts. But of the&nbsp;sovereign’s sergeants-at-arms there are
                two others to whom special&nbsp;duties are assigned, the one attending the speaker
                in the House of&nbsp;Commons, and the other attending the lord chancellor in the
                House&nbsp;of Lords, carrying their maces and executing their orders.@@<sup>11</sup>
                The&nbsp;yeomen of the guard date from the reign of Henry VII., and
                the&nbsp;gentlemen-at-arms from the reign of Henry VIII. The captain of&nbsp;each
                corps is always a member of the ministry and a peer. Besides&nbsp;the captains, the
                former, now called the queen’s bodyguard, consists&nbsp;of a lieutenant, ensign,
