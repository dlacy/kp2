<p><span class="font0">Ross, or Ross Carbery, a town in the county of Cork, Munster, Ireland, is situated on an eminence, at the head of&nbsp;a narrow creek in Ross Bay. It is a place of great antiquity. The town is laid out on a regular plan, and consists of a square, from the four corners of which diverge so&nbsp;many streets. It has an ancient cathedral, embosomed in&nbsp;trees, which, with the wooded banks of the bay, forms a remarkably beautiful feature in the appearance of the town.&nbsp;The harbour is spacious, but of little use, in consequence&nbsp;of being blocked up by the sand. The population amounted in 1831 to 1522.</span></p>

The inhabitants amount to 7700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSS-SHIRE, a county of Scotland, having that of Cromarty so curiously intermixed with it, that the description of both under one head is a matter not only of convenience,&nbsp;but of necessity. Ross-shire, comprising the districts of Ar-dross, Easter Ross, Ardmeanach or the Black Isle, Kintail,&nbsp;Strathcarron, and the island of Lewis, is the most extensive&nbsp;county in Scotland, and second only to Yorkshire as regards&nbsp;Great Britain. The county of Cromarty, on the other hand,&nbsp;is comparatively small. It is divided into ten portions, which&nbsp;are whimsically inserted into various parts of the larger county of Ross, like fragments of a more ancient rock in some&nbsp;newer geological formation. One of these parts is the original county of Cromarty, so called from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cromba,</span><span class="font0"> that is,&nbsp;crooked bay, from the windings of its shores, consisting of&nbsp;that portion which lies in the peninsula to the south of the&nbsp;Cromarty Frith, and which surrounds the county town. This&nbsp;part rises like a huge lump to a height of 470 feet above&nbsp;the level of the sea, which washes the base of its cliffs. As&nbsp;a county, it was very inconsiderable both in extent and in&nbsp;value. But by the straggling additions which were made&nbsp;to it towards the end of the seventeenth century, it was increased to fifteen times its former extent. Of these additions, one is that district surrounding Tarbat House, on the&nbsp;northern shore of Cromarty Bay ; and a second runs from&nbsp;the south side of Dornoch Frith to Moray Frith, cutting&nbsp;off that portion of the county of Ross which terminates in&nbsp;Tarbat Ness. Two more fragments are found lying on&nbsp;the north of the river Carron, which has its embouchure&nbsp;near Bonnar Bridge ; a fifth is that which runs northward&nbsp;from the burgh of Dingwall, taking in Castle Leod and&nbsp;part of Ben Weavish ; the sixth lies to the north of Loch&nbsp;Fannich, at some distance to the north-west of which a&nbsp;triangular morsel is found to the north of Loch Nid ; the&nbsp;eighth is that which stretches along the southern shore of&nbsp;Little Loch Broom ; and the ninth is the large district of&nbsp;Coygach, lying between the northern shore of Loch Broom&nbsp;and Sutherlandshire ; to which may be added the Summer&nbsp;Islands at the mouth of Loch Broom, which are about sixty&nbsp;miles distant from the town of Cromarty. As we have already mentioned under the article Cromarty, this strange&nbsp;arrangement of territory was produced by the influence of&nbsp;tllat great and powerfid proprietor, George viscount Tarbat, afterwards earl of Cromarty, who, wishing to have all&nbsp;his various lands included in one shire, got them annexed&nbsp;to his own county in 1685 and 1698. But these were not&nbsp;all, nor the most extraordinary, annexations which he accomplished. For, as a part of the county of Cromarty, we&nbsp;are compelled to notice Royston, or Caroline Park, locally&nbsp;situated within the county of Edinburgh, and but a couple</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">of miles from the Scottish capital. But such arrangements were by no means singular. The district of Ferintosh, belonging locally to Ross-shire, is in fact a part of Nairnshire;&nbsp;and from similar causes many of the houses in the Canongate&nbsp;of Edinburgh belong to different counties in Scotland, from&nbsp;their having been the town residences of Scottish noblemen&nbsp;whose estates lay in those different shires. By the addition&nbsp;of all those portions which we have enumerated, the extent&nbsp;of Cromarty is calculated to be equal to an area of 345&nbsp;square miles, or about 220,800 imperial acres. It contains&nbsp;only one entire parish, that of Cromarty, the other parts of&nbsp;it being parochially connected lvith parishes belonging to&nbsp;Ross-shire. The two towns of Cromarty and Ullapool belong to it, and its whole population may be estimated at&nbsp;about 5000 or 6000 souls. It is judicially under the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Ross, the sheriff-court being held&nbsp;at Cromarty every alternate Friday; and it is politically&nbsp;united with Ross-shire in returning a member to parliament. It contains about 20,000 arable acres. It has a&nbsp;considerable trade in pork for the English market ; and at&nbsp;Cromarty there is a thriving manufactory of hempen cloth,&nbsp;which employs about two hundred individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus given a general notion of the county of Cromarty as distinct from that of Ross, we may now proceed to consider the united counties under one view. Ross has its&nbsp;name from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ross,</span><span class="font0"> a promontory, and probably from that of&nbsp;Tarbat Ness. The united shires lie between 57.8. and 58.&nbsp;10. north latitude, and between 4. 0. and 5. 46. west longitude from Greenwich. From the extreme northern point&nbsp;of Coygach, to the southern extremity of the Ross-shire&nbsp;boundary, which lies to the north-east of Loch Hourn, in&nbsp;Inverness-shire, the distance may be about seventy-two&nbsp;miles ; whilst from Strath Oikel to the Cowrie Water the&nbsp;measurement is not more than thirty or thirty-five miles.&nbsp;The breadth from Tarbat Ness to the extreme western&nbsp;coast to the north of Gairloch is about eighty-five miles.&nbsp;The whole surface may be about 2424 square miles, or&nbsp;about 1,545,600 acres ; but to this must be added the&nbsp;Lewis, which contains four of the thirty-three parishes of&nbsp;which the united county of Ross and Cromarty consists.&nbsp;The boundaries are Sutherlandshire and Dornoch Frith on&nbsp;the north, and Moray Frith on the east, Inverness-shire&nbsp;on the south, and the Western Ocean on the west. On&nbsp;the eastern coast Cromarty Frith shoots inland from that&nbsp;of Moray through the narrow strait produced by those&nbsp;grand and picturesque headlands called the Sutors of Cromarty, and expands into a still and land-locked basin, capable of holding the whole navy of Great Britain. The&nbsp;headlands themselves are so lofty and precipitous, that it is&nbsp;not uncommon during gales of wind from the north-eastward, to see waves breaking upon them to the height of an&nbsp;hundred feet, whilst all within is smooth. Stowe, in his&nbsp;Chronicle, calls it “ an exceeding quiet and saue hauen ;”&nbsp;Boyce calls it “ the hail of seamen ;” and Buchanan is still&nbsp;more particular in his praise of it. It is rather more than&nbsp;five miles broad at the widest part, and its length is about&nbsp;eighteen. The depth averages from nine to twelve fathoms, but in the entrance it in some places exceeds thirty,&nbsp;a depth which nearly doubles that of Moray Frith, into which&nbsp;it opens. The continuity of outline of the western coast is&nbsp;interrupted by many bays and sea-lochs, which afford numerous havens of shelter. From south to north, these are Loch&nbsp;Alsh, with its two branches Loch Duich and Loch Ling ;&nbsp;Loch Carron, with its branch Loch Keeshorn ; Loch Tor-ridon, Gairloch, Loch Ewe, Loch Greinord, Little Loch&nbsp;Broom, Loch Broom, and Loch Enard. All these exhibit&nbsp;magnificent scenery. That of Loch Torridon, for example,&nbsp;is of the grandest and wildest character; as is likewise that&nbsp;of Loch Duich, rendered peculiarly interesting by the remains of the Castle of Eilean Donnan, the ancient stronghold of the Mackenzies, the Lords of Kintail.
