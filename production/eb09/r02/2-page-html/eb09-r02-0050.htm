They are&nbsp;addressed in the form of narrative to a lady who is not&nbsp;known, though guesses have been made at her identity.&nbsp;In the beginning there are some gaps. They display, in a&nbsp;rather irregular style and with some oddities of dialect&nbsp;and phrase, extraordinary narrative skill and a high degree&nbsp;of ability in that special art of the 17th century—the&nbsp;drawing of verbal portraits or characters. Few things&nbsp;of the kind are superior to the sketch of the early barricade of the Fronde in which the writer had so great a&nbsp;share, the hesitations of the court, the bold adventure&nbsp;of the coadjutor himself into the palace, and the final&nbsp;triumph of the insurgents. Dumas, who has drawn&nbsp;from this passage one of his very best scenes in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vingt&nbsp;Ans après,</span><span class="font1"> has done little but throw Retz into dialogue&nbsp;and amplify his language and incidents. Besides these&nbsp;memoirs and the very striking youthful essay of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conjuration de Piesque,</span><span class="font1"> Retz has left diplomatic papers,&nbsp;sermons, Mazarinades, and correspondence in some considerable quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font0"> of the Cardinal de Retz were first published in a very imperfect condition in 1717 at Nancy.

They were&nbsp;then re-edited from the autograph manuscript by Géruzez (Paris,&nbsp;1844), and by Champollion-Figeac with the Mazarinades, &amp;c. (Paris,&nbsp;1859). In 1870 a complete edition of the works of Retz was begun&nbsp;by M.

Reuben plays no great part in the patriarchal legend ; in the Elohistic version of the&nbsp;story of Joseph he appears in a somewhat favourable light,&nbsp;but in Gen. xxxv. 22 he is charged with a grave offence,&nbsp;which in Gen. xlix. 4 is given as a reason why the tribe&nbsp;which called him father did not take in Hebrew history the&nbsp;place proper to its seniority. The Reubenites settled east&nbsp;of the Jordan on the Moabite border. In Judges v. they&nbsp;are described as a pastoral tribe which took no share in&nbsp;the patriotic movement under Barak and Deborah. The&nbsp;Moabites soon proved too strong for them (comp.

<p><span class="font1">REUCHLIN, John (1455-1522), the first great German humanist and the restorer of Hebrew and in large measure&nbsp;also of Greek letters among his countrymen, was born&nbsp;February 22, 1455, at Pforzheim in the Black Forest, where&nbsp;his father was intendant of the Dominican monastery. In&nbsp;the pedantic taste of his time the name was Græcized by&nbsp;his Italian friends into Capnion, a form which Reuchlin&nbsp;himself uses as a sort of transparent mask when he&nbsp;introduces himself as an interlocutor in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo&nbsp;Mimfico.</span><span class="font1"> For his native place Reuchlin always retained&nbsp;an affection ; he constantly writes himself Phorcensis, and&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo,</span><span class="font1"> when he tells how he had sojourned at&nbsp;Paris and almost all the great schools of France and&nbsp;Germany, as well as at several Italian seats of learning&nbsp;and finally at Rome, the “caput studiorum,” he does not&nbsp;forget to ascribe to Pforzheim his first disposition to&nbsp;letters. Here he began his Latin studies in the monastery&nbsp;school, and, though in 1470 he was a short time in Freiburg,&nbsp;that university seems to have taught him little. Reuchlin⅛&nbsp;career as a scholar appears to have turned almost on an&nbsp;accident ; his fine voice gained him a place in the&nbsp;household of the margrave of Baden, and by and by,&nbsp;having already some reputation as a Latinist, he was&nbsp;chosen to accompany to the university of Paris the third&nbsp;son of the prince, a lad some years his junior, who was&nbsp;destined for an ecclesiastical career. This new connexion&nbsp;lasted but a year or so, but it determined the course of&nbsp;Reuchlin’s life. He now began to learn Greek, which had&nbsp;been taught in the French capital since 1470, and he also&nbsp;attached himself to the leader of the Paris realists, John&nbsp;à Lapide, a really worthy and learned man, whom he&nbsp;presently followed to the vigorous young university of&nbsp;Basel (1474). At Basel Reuchlin took his master’s&nbsp;degree (1477), and began to lecture with success, teaching&nbsp;a more classical Latin than was then common in German&nbsp;schools, and also explaining Aristotle in Greek. His&nbsp;studies in this language had been continued at Basel&nbsp;under Andronicus Contoblacas, and here too he formed the&nbsp;acquaintance of the bookseller Amorbach, for whom he&nbsp;prepared a Latin lexicon ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vocabulamus Breviloquus,</span><span class="font1"> 1st&nbsp;ed. 1475-76), which did good service in its time and&nbsp;ran through many editions. This first publication and&nbsp;Reuchlin’s account of his teaching at Basel in a letter to&nbsp;Cardinal Hadrian, February 1518, show that he had&nbsp;already found the work which in a larger sphere occupied&nbsp;his whole life. He was no original genius, but a born&nbsp;teacher. He had neither brilliant literary power like&nbsp;Erasmus nor epoch-making ideas like Luther, but he was&nbsp;the great master of all Germany, guiding his countrymen&nbsp;to sound learning, first in Latin and then in Greek and in&nbsp;Hebrew. But this work of teaching was not to be done&nbsp;mainly from the professor’s chair. Reuchlin soon left&nbsp;Basel to seek further Greek training with George&nbsp;Hieronymus at Paris, and learn to write a fair Greek hand&nbsp;that he might support himself by copying MSS. And&nbsp;now he felt that he must choose a profession. His choice&nbsp;fell on law, and he was thus led to the great school of&nbsp;Orleans (1478), and finally to Poitiers, where he became&nbsp;licentiate in July 1481, and so could look forward to&nbsp;honourable office in his native country, where he could&nbsp;pursue his scholarly tastes in an independent position.&nbsp;From Poitiers Reuchlin came in December 1481 to&nbsp;Tübingen. There he found friends to recommend him to&nbsp;Count Eberhard of Würtemberg, who was about to&nbsp;journey to Italy and required an interpreter. Reuchlin&nbsp;was selected, and in February 1482 left Stuttgart for&nbsp;Florence and Rome. The journey lasted but a few&nbsp;months, but it brought the German scholar into contact&nbsp;with several learned Italians, and his connexion with the&nbsp;count became permanent. On his return to Stuttgart he&nbsp;was named Geheimrath, and soon after he became doctor&nbsp;of laws and assessor in the high court. About this time&nbsp;he appears to have married, but little is known of his&nbsp;married life. He left no children ; but- in later years his&nbsp;sister’s grandson Melanchthon was almost as a son to him&nbsp;till the Reformation estranged them. Reuchlin’s life at&nbsp;Stuttgart was often broken by important missions, and in&nbsp;1490 he was again in Italy. Here he saw Pico, to whose&nbsp;Cabbalistic doctrines he afterwards became heir, and also&nbsp;made the friendship of the pope’s privy secretary,&nbsp;Questemberg, which was of service to him in his later&nbsp;troubles. Again in 1492 he was employed on an embassy&nbsp;to the emperor at Linz, and here he began to read Hebrew&nbsp;with the kaiser’s Jewish physician Loans. He knew&nbsp;something of this language before, but Loans’s instruction&nbsp;laid the basis of that thorough knowledge which he&nbsp;afterwards improved on his third visit to Rome in 1498 by&nbsp;the instruction of Obadiah Sforno of Cesena.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
