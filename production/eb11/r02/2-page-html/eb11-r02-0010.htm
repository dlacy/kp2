<p><span class="font1">REGULAR, orderly, following or arranged according to a rule (Lat</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">. regula,</span><span class="font1"> whence O. Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reule,</span><span class="font1"> whence English “ rule ”),&nbsp;steady, uniform, formally correct. The earliest' and only&nbsp;use in English until the 16th century was in the Med. Lat. sense&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regularis,</span><span class="font1"> one bound by and subject to the rule </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(regula)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of a monastic or religious order, a member of the “ regular ”&nbsp;as opposed to the “ secular ” clergy, and so, as a substantive,&nbsp;a regular, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> a monk or friar. Another specific application&nbsp;is to that portion of the armed forces of a nation which are&nbsp;organized on a permanent system, the standing army, as&nbsp;opposed to “ irregulars,” levies raised on a voluntary basis&nbsp;and disbanded when the particular campaign or war for which&nbsp;they were raised is at an end. In the British army, the forces&nbsp;were divided into regulars, militia and volunteers, until 1906,&nbsp;when they were divided into regular and territorial forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGULUS, MARCUS ATILIUS, Roman general and consul (for the second time) in the ninth year of the First Punic War&nbsp;(256 B.c.). He was one of the commanders in the Punic naval&nbsp;expedition which shattered the Carthaginian fleet at Ecnomus,&nbsp;and landed an army on Carthaginian territory (see Punic&nbsp;Wars). The invaders were so successful that the other&nbsp;consul, L. Manlius VuIso, was recalled to Rome, Regulus being&nbsp;left behind to finish the war. After a severe defeat at Adys&nbsp;near Carthage, the Carthaginians were inclined for peace, but&nbsp;the terms proposed by Regulus were so harsh that they&nbsp;resolved to continue the war. In 255, Regulus was completely&nbsp;defeated and taken prisoner by the Spartan Xanthippus.&nbsp;There is no further trustworthy information about him. According to tradition, he remained in captivity until 250, when after&nbsp;the defeat of the Carthaginians at Panormus he was sent to&nbsp;Rome on parole to negotiate a peace or exchange of prisoners.&nbsp;On his arrival he strongly urged the senate to refuse both&nbsp;proposals, and returning to Carthage was tortured to death&nbsp;(Horace, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 5). This story made Regulus to the later&nbsp;Romans the type of heroic endurance; but most historians&nbsp;regard it as insufficiently attested, Polybius being silent. The&nbsp;tale was probably invented by the annalists to excuse the&nbsp;cruel treatment of the Carthaginian prisoners by the Romans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REHAN, ADA (i860- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American actress, whose real</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">name was Crehan, was born in Limerick, Ireland, on the 22nd of April i860. Her parents removed to the United States&nbsp;when she was five years old, and it was in Newark, N.J., that&nbsp;in 1874 she made her first stage appearance in a small part in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Across the Continent.</span><span class="font1"> She was with Mrs John Drew’s stock&nbsp;company in Philadelphia, John W. Albaugh’s in Albany and&nbsp;Baltimore, and other companies for several seasons, playing&nbsp;every kind of minor part, until she became connected with&nbsp;Augustin Daly’s theatrical management in 1879. Under his&nbsp;training she soon showed her talents for vivid, charming portrayal of character, first in modern and then in older comedies.&nbsp;She was the heroine in all the Daly adaptations from the German,&nbsp;and added to her triumphs the parts of Peggy in Wycherly’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Country Girl,</span><span class="font1"> Julia in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hunchback,</span><span class="font1"> and especially Katharina&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Taming of the Shrew,</span><span class="font1"> besides playing Rosalind and&nbsp;Viola.

<p><span class="font1">REHEARSAL (from “ rehearse,” to say over again, repeat, recount, O.Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rehercer,</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re,</span><span class="font1"> again, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hercer,</span><span class="font1"> to harrow,&nbsp;cf. “ hearse,” the original meaning being to rake or go over&nbsp;the same ground again as with a harrow), a recital of words or&nbsp;statements, particularly the trial performance in private of a-play, musical composition, recitation, &amp;c., for the purpose of&nbsp;practice preparatory to the performance in public. In the&nbsp;theatre a “ full rehearsal ” is one in which the whole performance&nbsp;is gone through with all the performers, a “ dress rehearsal ”&nbsp;one in which the performance is carried out with scenery,&nbsp;costumes, properties, &amp;c., exactly as it is to be played in&nbsp;public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REHOBOAM (Heb. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rehab'äm,</span><span class="font1"> probably “ the clan is en-’arged,” sec Ecclus. xlvii. 23, although on the analogy of Rehabiah and Bab. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ra’bi-ilu, 'Am</span><span class="font1"> may represent some god;&nbsp;Septuagint reads </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ροβοαμ),</span><span class="font1"> son of Solomon and first king of&nbsp;Judah. On the events which led to his accession and the&nbsp;partition of the Hebrew monarchy, see Jeroboam, Solomon.&nbsp;Although his age is given as forty-one (1 Kings xiv. 21), the&nbsp;account of his treatment of the Israelite deputation (1 Kings xii.),&nbsp;as also 2 Chron. xiii. 7, give an impression of youth. He was&nbsp;partly of Ammonite origin (1 Kings xiv. 21), and, like his&nbsp;father, continued the foreign worship which his connexions&nbsp;involved. The chief event of his reign was the incursion of&nbsp;Egypt under Shcshonk (Shishak) I., who came up against&nbsp;Judah and despoiled the temple about 930 b.c. (see Egypt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History,</span><span class="font1"> § “ DeItaic Dynasties ”). That this invasion is to&nbsp;be connected with the friendly relations which are said to&nbsp;have subsisted between the first of the Libyan dynasty and&nbsp;Rchoboam’s rival is unlikely. Sheshonk has figured his&nbsp;campaign outside the great temple of Karnak with à list of&nbsp;some 150 places which he claims to have conquered, but it&nbsp;is possible that these were only tributary, and the names may&nbsp;be largely based upon older lists. Towns of both Judah and&nbsp;Israel are incorporated, and it is possible that Jerusalem once&nbsp;stood where now the stone is mutilated.@@<sup>1</sup> The book of&nbsp;Chronicles enumerates several Judaean cities fortified by&nbsp;Rehoboam (not necessarily connected with Sheshonk's campaign), and characteristically regards the invasion as a punishment (2 Chron. xi. 5 sqq., xii. 1-15; for the prophet Shemaiah&nbsp;see I Kings xii. 21-24). Of Rehoboam<sup>i</sup>S successor Abijah (or&nbsp;Abijam) little is known except a victory over Jeroboam recorded in 2 Chron. xiii.

<p><span class="font1">REICHA, ANTON JOSEPH (1770-1836), French musical theorist and teacher of composition, was born at Prague on the&nbsp;27th of February 1770, and educated chiefly by his uncle,&nbsp;Joseph Reicha (1746-1795), a clever violoncellist, who first&nbsp;received him into his house at Wallcrstein in Bohemia, and&nbsp;afterwards carried him to Bonn. Here, about 1789, he was made&nbsp;flutist in the orchestra of the elector. In 1794 he went to&nbsp;Hamburg and gave music lessons there, also producing the&nbsp;opera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Godefroid de Montfort.</span><span class="font1"> He was in Paris in 1799 and in&nbsp;Vienna from 1802 to 1808, during which period he saw much of&nbsp;Beethoven and Haydn. In the latter year he returned to Paris,&nbsp;where he produced three operas without much success. In&nbsp;1817 he succeeded Mchul as professor of counterpoint at the&nbsp;Conservatoire. In 1829 he was naturalized as a Frenchman, and&nbsp;in 1835 he was admitted as a member of the Institute in the&nbsp;place of Boieldieu. He died in Paris on the 28th of May 1836.&nbsp;He produced a vast quantity of church music, five operas, a&nbsp;number of symphonies, oratorios and many miscellaneous&nbsp;works. Though clever and ingenious, his compositions are&nbsp;more remarkable for their novelty than for the beauty of the&nbsp;ideas upon which they are based. His fame is, indeed, more&nbsp;securely based upon his didactic works. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traite de mélodie&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Paris, 1814), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cours de composition musicale</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1818),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traite de haute composition musicale</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1824-26), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Art du compositeur dramatique</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1833), are valuable and&nbsp;instructive essays for the student, though many of the theories&nbsp;they set forth are now condemned as erroneous.</span></p>
