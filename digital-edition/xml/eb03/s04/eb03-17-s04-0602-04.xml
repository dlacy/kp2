a denomination of nuns of St Peter of lcantara, inſtituted in 1676, the deſign of which was to imitate the ſevere penitent life of that ſaint. Thus they are to keep a continual ſilence, never to open their mouths to a ſtranger ; to employ their time wholly in ſpiritual exercises, and leave their temporal concerns to a number of maids, who have a particular ſuperior in a ſeparate part of the monaſtery : they always go bare-footed, without sandals ; gird themſelves with a thick cord, and wear no linen.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
