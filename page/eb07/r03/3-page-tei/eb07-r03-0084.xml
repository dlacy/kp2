He estimates the number of children receiving a home education at 597,424 individuals, which would give to Russia one pupil enjoying education for every fifty of the inhabitants. According to M. Ouvaroff's last report, this proportion had in 1837 become one in forty-five. The data upon which both the minister and Krusenstern make their calculations are very problematical. We greatly doubt if the proportion is so high as it is here given. Mr Bremner states@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> that “ popular education is advancing but slowly ; for in many of the governments of the interior, out of every four or five hundred of the population, there is not more than<hi rend="italic">one</hi>  young person attending school. The educational schemes of the government have hitherto been unsuccessful in the provinces, because the people, being ignorant of the value of instruction, seldom think of sending their children to school. In the large cities, however, public seminaries are most successfully conducted and numerously attended.” With regard to the provinces, considering the character both of the country and of the peasantry, we think that there may be some truth in Mr Bremner’s statement ; but it cannot be of very extensive application, the discrepancy being so great between it and those of the individuals mentioned.</p><p>Independently of the institutions occupied directly in the education of youth, Russia has further her academies of science, her learned societies, her public libraries, and her museums. The number of scientific establishments in St Petersburg is very great ; and the merits of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, in relation to its mathematical, astronomical, mineralogical, and geographical labours, are incontestable. The universities of Moscow and Dorpat are also highly celebrated. The institution last named would appear to be the most prosperous of all the universities in Russia, many of its professors, such as Struve the astronomer, Parrot the traveller, and others, being men of great eminence in the scientific world. Of the Russian libraries, that of St Petersburg is the richest and most considerable, containing 413,000 volumes. After it rank the Hermitage Library, consisting of 100,000 volumes ; the library, of the Academy of Sciences, 90,000 volumes; and those belonging to the universities of Dorpat, Moscow, Kief, Kazan, Kharkov, and St Petersburg, each being highly respectable, as w ill be seen from a table already given. In 1837, the total amount of books in the public libraries of Russia amounted to 858,635 volumes. It ought to be mentioned, however, that about two thirds of the scientific and literary treasure of Russia have been plundered from unhappy Poland. The number of literary and scientific institutions throughout the empire, including several purely philanthropic associations, may be estimated at fifty, of which twenty belong to St Petersburg alone.</p><p>In Russia proper, the owners of estates are under obligations to provide their peasantry w’ith the means of support, and in times of distress to relieve them. On the estates belonging to the crown, a methodical system of parochial relief is established, each parish being compelled to supply its destitute poor, in poor-houses, with fuel, food, and clothing. In Courland, Esthonia, and Livonia, a similar compulsory system is established, the landowners and farmers contributing in proportion to their occupations or rental, and the overseers being elected by the rate-payers. Public begging is forbidden, and vagrants set to work by the overseers. Even in Siberia the authorities are under legal obligation to prevent any individual of the people committed to their charge from suffering want, or remaining without assistance when in distress. In the Russo-Polish provinces a similar system prevails as in Russia proper.</p><p>The productions of the Russian press are no index to the national cultivation. Amongst the great body of the people there is little or no taste for literature. It is only amongst the higher classes that any thing like a reading public is to be found ; so that it may well be believed native authors, or translators of foreign literature, have little encouragement held out to them, at least of a public nature. It redounds, however, to the credit of the late sovereigns of Russia, and the more wealthy of the nobles, that they have done much to foster Russian literature, by the munificent favours which they have bestowed on native writers. But that ready market, a large and intelligent reading community, is alone calculated to draw forth to any great extent the talents and the genius of native writers, and to promote the interests of literature. Thus, although many eminent men have appeared in Russia as authors, such as Lomonoscoff, Mura-vieff, Karamzin, Pouschkin (a celebrated poet, who perished in a duel in the flower of his age, February 1837), and some others, its literature is yet in an infant or imitative state. The greater number of the books that are published are translations from the German and French, and their circulation is limited. Karamzin’s History of Russia, the most popular work ever published in that country, and said to be the one most widely circulated, sold only to the extent of 1500 copies in two editions. In the Russian empire are published eighty papers and minor periodicals, and about twelve scientific and literary journals. Of course, nothing like the liberty of the press is known in Russia. Indeed there cannot be said to exist a press at all in the common acceptation of the term, as the newspapers are published by the government, and no periodical literature of a political character exists in the Russian language. In 1837, the printing establishments in the empire were 171, of which ninety-four were maintained by government, and seventy-seven by private persons. There were seventy-four lithographic establishments, nine of which were supported by government. A strict censorship of the press has been instituted, and its jealous vigilance is particularly directed to English newspapers, all but the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>  being absolutely prohibited from entering the capital. The censorships of the press are conducted according to the precepts of a new regulation, which is due to the solicitude of the Emperor Nicholas, and was issued in 1828. In university towns it is intrusted to committees, and everywhere else committed to censors appointed <hi rend="italic">ad hoc.</hi>  The censorship of works relating to religion rests with the ecclesiastical authorities. Every book hostile to the creed of the Greek church, to monarchical or autocratical authority, to decency, to morality, to the honour of individuals, is prohibited. The first duty of the censors in examining a book, is “ to consider what is the object that the author has proposed to himself.” These rules apply alike to national and to foreign Works. Literary property is a vested interest during the life of the author, and for twenty-five years after his death. Literary piracy is punished by a fine equivalent to double the cost of an edition of twelve hundred copies. In 1835, seven hundred and eight works were printed in Russia, and three thousand foreign volumes were imported. Mr Bremner informs us, that in spite of all restrictions, “ Russian literature is advancing with great rapidity.”</p><p>Under this head two languages are to be distinguished: 1.
