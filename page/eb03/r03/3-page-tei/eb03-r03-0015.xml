That we may have a clear conception of the principle which regulates this part of the proceſs, we ſhall begin with the ſimpleſt poſſible caſe, the union of two yarns into one line. This is not a very uſual fabric for rigging, but we ſelect it for its ſimplicity.</p><p>When hemp has been ſplit into very fine fibres by the hatchet, it becomes exceedingly ſoft and pliant, and after it has lain for ſome time in the form of fine yarn, it may be unreeled and thrown looſe, without loſing much of its twiſt. Two ſuch yarns may be put on the whirl of a ſpinning wheel, and thrown, like flaxen yarn, ſo as to make ſewing thread. It is in this way, indeed, that the ſailmaker’s ſewing thread is manufactured; and when it has been kept on the reel, or on balls or bobbins, for ſome time, it retains its twiſt as well as its uſes require. But this is by no means the caſe with yarns ſpun for great cordage. The hemp is ſo elaſtic, the number of fibres twiſted together is ſo great, and the diameter of the yarn (which is a fort of lever on which the elaſticity of the fibre exerts itſelf) is ſo conſiderable, that no keeping will make the fibres retain this con-ftrained poſition. The end of a rope-yarn being thrown looſe, it will immediately untwiſt, and this with conſiderable force and ſpeed. It would, therefore, be a fruſtleſs attempt to twiſt two ſuch yarns together ; yet the ingenuity of man has contrived to make uſe of this very tendency to untwiſt not only to counteract itſelf, but even to produce another and a permanent twiſt, which requires force to undo it, and which will receiver itſelf when this force is removed. Every perſon muſt recollect that, when he has twiſted a packthread very hard with his fingers between his two hands, if he ſlackens the thread by bringing his hands nearer together, the packthread will immediately curl up, running into loops or kinks, and will even twiſt itſelf into a neat and firm cord. FamiΓiar as this fact is, it would puzzle any perſon not accuſtomed to theſe ſubjects to explain it with diſtinctneſs. We ſhall conſider it with ſome care, not as a piece of mechanical curioſity, but as a fundamental principle in this manufacture, which will give us clear inſtructions to direct us in the moſt delicate part of the whole proceſs. And we beg the attention of the artiſts themſelves to a thing which they ſeem to have ©verlooked.</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">mil, nd (</hi>fig. 4.) be two yarns fixed to one point <hi rend="italic">d<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  and let both of them be twiſted, each round its own axis, in the direction <hi rend="italic">ab c,</hi>  which will cauſe the fibres to lie in a ſcrew form, as repreſented in the figure. If the end <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  of the yarn <hi rend="italic">m d</hi>  were at liberty to turn round the point <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>  it would turn accordingly, as often as the end <hi rend="italic">m</hi>  is turned round, and the yarn would acquire no twiſt ; but being attached to ſome ſolid body it cannot turn without turning this body. It has, however, this tendency, and the body muſt be forcibly prevented from turning. If it be held faſt for a time, and then let go, it will be turned round, and it will not ftop till it has turned as often as the end <hi rend="italic">m</hi>  has been twiſted, and now all the twiſt will be undone. Thus it is the tendency of the yarn <hi rend="italic">rn d</hi>  to untwiſt at the end <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  (becauſe it is kept faſt at wι), which produces this motion of the body attached to it at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>  What we have ſaid of the yarn <hi rend="italic">m d</hi>  is equally true of the yarn <hi rend="italic">nd.</hi>  Both tend to turn, and will turn, the body attached at <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  round the common ajps, in the ſame direc</p><p>tion in which they are twiſted. Let fig. 5. be ſuppoſed a croſs ſection of the two yarns touching each other at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>  and there glued to a board. The fibres of each pull obliquely, that is, they both pull away from the board, and pull laterally. The direction of this lateral pull of the ſibres in the circumference of each yarn is repreſented by the little darts drawn round the circumferences. Theſe actions directly oppoſe and balance each other at <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  ; but in the ſemicircles <hi rend="italic">o e t, tſo,</hi>  they evidently conſpire to turn the board round in the ſame direction. The ſame may be ſaid of the outer halves of any circles deſeribed within theſe. In the inner halves of theſe inner circles the actions of ſome fibres oppoſe each other ; but in every circle there are many more conſpiring actions than oppoſing ones, and the conſpi-ring actions exert themſelves by longer levers, ſo that their joint momentum greatly exceeds that of the op-poling forces. It may be demonſtrated, that if all the ſibres exert equal forces, the force which tends to turn the board round the common axis is J of the force employed to twiſt both tilg yarns.</p><p>Suppoſe then that the ſolid body to which the yarns are attached is at liberty to turn round the common axis ; it cannot do this without carrying the yarns round with it. They muſt, therefore, turn round each other, and thus compoſe a rope or cord <hi rend="italic">k l,</hi>  having its . component yarns (now called <hi rend="italic">flrands)</hi>  lying in a direction oppoſite to that of the ſibres in each ſtrand. The rope will take this twiſt, while each of the ſtrands is really untwiſting, and the motion will not ſtop till all is again in equilibrio. If the yarns had no diameter and no rigidity, their elaſtic contraction would not be balanced till the cord had made half the number of turns which had been given to that part of the yarn which is thus doubled up. But, as the yarns have a ſenſible diameter, the ſame ultimate contraction of the ſibres will be expended by the twiſting of the cord in fewer turns, even if the yarns had no rigidity. The turns neceſſary for this purpoſe will be ſo much fewer, in proportion to the twiſt of the yarns, as the ſibres of the yarn lie more obliquely, that is, as the yarns are more twiſted. But further, this contractile force has to overcome the rigidity or ſtiſſneſs of the yarns. This requires force merely to <hi rend="italic">bend</hi>  it into the ſcrew form ; and therefore, when all is again at reſt, the ſibres are in a ſtate of ſtrain, and the rope is not ſo much cloſed by doubling as it would have been had the yarns been ſofter. If any thing can be done to it in this ſtate which will ſoften the yarns, it will twiſt itſelf more up. It has therefore a <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi>  to twiſt more up ; and if this be aided by an external force which will bend the ſtrands, this will happen. Beating it with a ſpft mallet will have this efj ſectj or, if it be forcibly twiſted till the ſibres are allowed to contract as much as they would have done had the yarn been perfectly ſoft, the cord will keep this twiſt without any effort ; and this muſt be conſidered as its moſt perfect ſtate, in relation to the degree of twiſt originally given to the yarns. It will have no tendency to run into kinks, which is both troubleſome and dangerous, and the fibres will not be exerting any uſeleſs effort.</p><p>To attain this ſtate ſhould therefore be the aim of every part of this ſecond proceſs ; and this principle, ſhould be kept in view through the whole of it.</p><p>The component parts of a rope are called ſtrands, aa</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
