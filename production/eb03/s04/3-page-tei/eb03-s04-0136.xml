The number of members is limited to 50 ; beſides whom there are ſeveral honorary members, all of whom are elected by ballot ; and the officers are choſen annually in April. Four volumes of valuable eſſays have been already publiſhed by this ſociety.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Society for Promoting the Discovery of the interior Parts oſ Africa.</hi> This ſociety or aſſociation for exploring the internal diſtricts of Africa, of which ſo little is at preſent known, was formed in London by ſome opulent individuals in 1788 ; who, ſtrongly impreſſed with a conviction of the practicability and utility of thus enlarging the fund of human knowledge, determined if poſſible to rescue the age from that ſtigma which attaches to its ignorance of ſo large and ſo near a portion of the globe. The founders of this ſociety reſolved to admit no man a member for a ſhorter period than three years, during which he muſt pay annually into the public fund five guineas. After three years, any member, upon giving a year’s notice, may withdraw himſelf from the aſſociation. During the firſt 12 months each oſ the members was allowed to recommend for the approbation of the ſociety ſuch of his friends as he might think proper to be admitted into it ; but ſince that period we believe all additional members have been elected by a ballot of the aſſociation at large. A committee was choſen by ballot to manage the funds of the ſociety, to chooſe proper perrons to be ſent on the discovery of the interior parts of Africa, and to carry on the society’s correſpondence, with expreſs injunctions to diſeloſe no intelligence received from their agents but to the ſociety at large. But a fuller account of the nature of this eſtabliſhment, and the very happy efforts they have made, may be ſeen in the ſuperb edition of their proceedings printed in 1790, 4to, for their own uſe ; or in the 8vo edition ſince made public. They ſoon found two gentleman, Mr Lucas and Mr Ledyard, who were ſingularly well qualified for the important miſſion. The information they have acquired will be found in the above work ; with a new map by Mt Renneſe exhibiting the geographical knowledge collected by the African aſſoeiatioa. Mr Ledyard very unfortunately died during his reſearches at Cairo.</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Society oſ Antiquaries of London,</hi> was founded about the year 1572 by Archbishop Parker, a munificent patron of learned men. For the ſpace of 20 years it aſſembled in the houſe of Sir Robert Cotton ; in 1589 they reſolved to apply to Queen Elizabeth for a charter and a public building where they might hold their meetings ; but it is uncertain whether any ſuch application was ever made. In the mean time, the reputation of the ſociety gradually increaſed, and at length it excited the jealouſy of James I. who was afraid leſt it ſhould preſunre to canvaſs the ſecret tranſactions of his government. He accordingly diſſolved it. But in the beginning of the preſent century, the Antiquarian Society began to revive ; and a number of gentlemen, eminent for their affection to this ſcience, had weekly meetings, in which they examined the antiquities and hiſtory oſ Great Britain preceding the reign of James I. but without excluding any other remarkable antiquities that might be offered to them. From this time the ſociety grew in importance ; and in 1750 they unanimouſly reſolved to petition the king for a charter of incorporation. This they obtained the year following, by</p><p>the influence oſ the celebrated earl <hi rend="italic">of Hardwicke,</hi> then lord chancellor, and Martin Folkes, Eſq; who was then their president. The king declared himſelf their founder and patron, and empowered them to have a body oſ ſtatutes, and a common ſeal, and to hold in perpetuity lands, &amp;c. to the yearly value of L. 1000.</p><p>The chief object of the inquiries and reſearches of the ſociety are Britiſh antiquities and hiſtory ; not, however, wholly excluding thoſe of other countries. It muſt be acknowledged, that the ſtudy of antiquity offers to the curious and inquiſitive a large field for reſearch and amuſement. The inquirer in this branch furniſhes the hiſtorian with his beſt materials, while he diſtinguiſhes from truth the fictions of a bold invention, and ascertains the credibility of facts ; and to the philoſopher he preſents a fruitful ſource of ingenious peculation, while he points out to him the way of thinking, and the manners of men, under all the varieties of aſpect in which they have appeared.</p><p>An antiquarian ought to be a man of ſolid judgment, poſſeſſed of learning and ſcience, that he may not be an enthuſiaſtic admirer of every thing that is ancient merely becauſe it is ancient ; but be qualified to diſtinguiſh between thoſe reſearches which are valuable and important, and those which are trifling and useleſs. It is from the want oſ theſe qualifications that ſome men have contracted ſuch a blind paſſion for every thing that is ancient, that they have expoſed themſelves to ridicule, and their ſtudy to contempt. But if a regard to utility were always to regulate the purſuits of the antiquarian, the ſhafts of ſatire would ho longer be levelled at him; but he would be reſpected as the man who labours to reſtore or to preſerve ſuch ancient productions as are ſuited to illuminate religion, philosophy, and hiſtory, or to improve the arts of life.</p><p>We by no means intend to apply theſe obſervations to any particular ſociety of antiquarians ; but we throw them out, becauſe we know that an aſſiduous ſtudy of antiquity is apt, like the ardent pursuit of money, to lose sight of its original object, and to degenerate into a paſſion which miſtakes the mean for the end, and considers poſſeſſion without a regard to utility as enjoyment.</p><p>An aſſociation ſimilar to that of the Antiquarian Society of London was founded in <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> in 1780, and received the royal charter in 1783.</p><p>Beſides theſe literary ſocieties here mentioned, there are a great number more in different parts of Europe, ſome of which are noticed under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Academy, </hi>Thoſe which are omitted are not omitted on account of any idea of their inferior importance ; but either becauſe we have had <hi rend="smallcaps">ho</hi> accuse to authentic information, or becauſe they reſemble the ſocieties already deſcribed ſo cloſely, that we could have given nothing but their names.</p><p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Societies for Encouraging and Promoting Arts, Man utactures,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>I. London<hi rend="italic"> Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce,</hi> was inſtituted in the year 1754 by Lord Folkſtone, Lord Romney, Dr Stephen Hales, and a few private gentlemen ; but the merit of this inſtitution chiefly belonged to Mr William Shipley,</p></body></text></TEI>
