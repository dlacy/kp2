<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hincmar, has lately found an able champion of its authenticity in the Abbe Dessailly. For Remigius’s connexion with Vedastus (who assisted in the conversion of Clovis), St Medard, St Eleutherius,&nbsp;&amp;c., see the Bollandist </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vita Jtemigii</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> alluded to above and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Acta&nbsp;Sanctorum</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for Feburary 6, June 8, and February 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REMIREMONT, the chief town of an arrondisseinent of the department of the Vosges, France, 17 miles south-south-east of Epinal by rail, on the banks of the Moselle&nbsp;where it is joined by the Moselotte. It is a pretty and&nbsp;well-built town picturesquely surrounded by forest-clad&nbsp;mountains, and commanded by Fort Parmont, one of the&nbsp;line of defensive works along the Moselle. Besides a&nbsp;great cotton spinning-mill (30,000 spindles) brought from&nbsp;Miilhausen after the war of 1870, it possesses tanneries,&nbsp;weaving-factories, and saw-mills ; and it trades in timber,&nbsp;cattle, cheese, coopers’ wares, &lt;fec. The more interesting&nbsp;buildings belong to the ancient abbey, to which the town&nbsp;owes most of its fame. The abbey church was consecrated&nbsp;to Pope Leo IX. in person in 1051. The abbatial residence (which now contains the mairie, the court-house,&nbsp;and the public library) has been twice rebuilt in modern&nbsp;times (in 1750, and again after the fire of 1871), but the&nbsp;original plan and style have been preserved in the imposing&nbsp;front, the vestibule, and the grand staircase. The population of the town was 6212 in 1871, and 7857 in 1881;&nbsp;that of the commune 6510 and 8126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Remiremont has its name from St Romaric, one of the companions of St Columban of Luxeuil, who founded a monastery and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">convent on the hills above the site where the town now stands, j&nbsp;On the destruction of these establishments by the Hungarians in&nbsp;910 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the nuns took refuge at Remiremont, and their new&nbsp;convent became famous under an abbess who “carried not a crosier&nbsp;but a sceptre.” Enriched by dukes of Lorraine, kings of France,&nbsp;and emperors of Germany, the ladies of Remiremont ultimately </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">\&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">attained to great power. The abbess was a princess of the empire, </span><span class="font0">j&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and received consecration at the hands of the pope at Rome. The ;&nbsp;canonesses (fifty in number) were selected only from those who </span><span class="font0">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">could give proof of noble descent. Their property comprised fifty- j&nbsp;two signiories and twenty-two petty lordships. On Whitsun Monday the neighbouring parishes paid homage to the chapter in a&nbsp;ceremony called the “ Kyrioles ” ; and on their accession dukes of&nbsp;Lorraine had to come to Remiremont with great pomp to swear to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">j&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">continue their protection. The “War of the Scutcheons” (Panon- i&nbsp;ceaux) in 1566 between the duke and the abbess ended in favour&nbsp;of the duke ; and the abbess never recovered her former position.&nbsp;The townsfolk took advantage of this and similar contests to&nbsp;extend their municipal privileges. In the 17th century the ladies&nbsp;of Remiremont fell away so much from the original monastic rule&nbsp;as to take the title of countesses, renounce their vows, and marry.&nbsp;The town was attacked by the French in 1638, and ruined by the&nbsp;earthquake of 1682. With the rest of Lorraine it was joined to&nbsp;France in 1766. The monastery on the hill (Mont de Romeric or&nbsp;Saint Mont) and the nunnery in the town were both suppressed in&nbsp;the Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REMONSTRANTS meant originally those Dutch Protestants who, after the death of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Arminius </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.), continued to maintain the views associated with his name, and in&nbsp;1610 presented to the states of Holland and Friesland a&nbsp;“ remonstrance ” in five articles formulating their points of&nbsp;departure from stricter Calvinism. Their adversaries met&nbsp;them with a “ counter remonstrance, ” and so were known&nbsp;as the Counter Remonstrants. The conflict continued to&nbsp;rage till 1618-19, when the synod of Dort (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dort, </span><span class="font0">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Synod of) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">established the victory of the stricter school, i&nbsp;The judgment of the synod was enforced by the deposition&nbsp;and in some cases the banishment of Remonstrant ministers;&nbsp;but the Government soon became convinced that their party&nbsp;was not dangerous to the state, and in 1630 they were&nbsp;formally allowed liberty to reside in all parts of Holland&nbsp;and build churches and schools. In 1621 they had also&nbsp;received liberty to make a settlement in Schleswig, where&nbsp;they built themselves the town of Friedriclistadt. This&nbsp;colony still exists. The doctrine of the Remonstrants was&nbsp;embodied in 1621 in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">confessio</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> written by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Episcopius&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> their great theologian, while Wytenbogaert gave them&nbsp;a catechism and regulated their churchly order. The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Remonstrants adopted a simple synodical constitution ; but their importance was henceforth more theological than&nbsp;ecclesiastical. Their seminary in Amsterdam has boasted&nbsp;of many distinguished names—Curcellæus, Limborch,&nbsp;Wetstein, Le Clerc ; and their liberal school of theology,&nbsp;which naturally grew more liberal and even rationalistic,&nbsp;reacted powerfully on the state church. The Remonstrants are now a small body (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Holland, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xii. p. 66),&nbsp;but respected for their traditions of scholarship and liberal&nbsp;thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REMSCHEID, a manufacturing town of Rhenish Prussia, in the district of Düsseldorf, sometimes dignified&nbsp;with the title of the “ Rhenish Sheffield,” is situated about&nbsp;20 miles to the north-east of Cologne, at a height of 1120&nbsp;feet above the sea. It is the centre of the German hardware industry, and large quantities of tools, scythes,&nbsp;skates, and other small articles in iron, steel, and brass&nbsp;are annually made here for exportation to all parts of&nbsp;Europe, the East, and North and South America. In 1880&nbsp;the commune contained 30,029 inhabitants (26,844 Protestants), of whom 11,000 belonged to Remscheid proper&nbsp;and the rest to the manufacturing villages with which it is&nbsp;grouped. The name of Remscheid occurs in a document&nbsp;of 1132, and the town received the first impulse to its&nbsp;! industrial importance through the immigration of Protestant refugees from France and Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RÉMUSAT, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Abel </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1788-1832), a distinguished Chinese scholar, was born at Paris, 5th September 1788.&nbsp;His father, a surgeon, superintended his early education in&nbsp;person and designed him for the medical profession. Jean&nbsp;Pierre Abel Rémusat graduated with distinction as M.D.&nbsp;in 1813, and for a short time held a hospital appointment,&nbsp;but his heart had long been in other studies. A Chinese&nbsp;herbal in the collection of the Abbé Tersan had attracted&nbsp;his attention when he was still a lad ; he taught himself to&nbsp;read by great perseverance and with very imperfect helps,&nbsp;and at the end of five years’ study he produced in 1811 an&nbsp;I </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essai sur la langue et la littérature Chinoises,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and a paper&nbsp;on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured&nbsp;him the patronage of De Sacy. In 1814a chair of Chinese&nbsp;was founded at the Collège de France, and Rémusat was&nbsp;])laced in it. From this time he gave himself wholly to&nbsp;the languages of the Extreme East, and published a long&nbsp;series of useful works, among which his contributions from&nbsp;Chinese sources to the history of the Tartar nations claim&nbsp;special notice. Rémusat became an editor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal&nbsp;de Savants</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 1818, and founder and first secretary of the&nbsp;Paris Asiatic Society in 1822 ; he held also in the courso&nbsp;of his life various honourable and lucrative Government&nbsp;appointments. He married in 1830, but had no children.&nbsp;He died at Paris, 4 th June 1832, and his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">éloge</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was written&nbsp;by De Sacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RÉMUSAT, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Charles François ]Marie, Comte de </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1797-1875), French politician and man of letters, was&nbsp;born at Paris on the 13th March 1797.. His father,&nbsp;also Comte de Rémusat, of a good though not very dis-! tinguished family in the district of Toulouse, was a man of&nbsp;! considerable literary taste, of much administrative ability,&nbsp;and of moderate Liberal views in politics. He was&nbsp;chamberlain to Napoleon, but disapproved of the emperor’s&nbsp;absolutist government and aggressive policy, and after the&nbsp;restoration became prefect first of the Haute Garonne and&nbsp;then of the Nord. His wife (mother of Charles) was a&nbsp;still more remarkable person, whose full abilities have only&nbsp;recently been made known. Her maiden name was Claire&nbsp;Elisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes. She was born&nbsp;in 1780, and was early introduced to the salons, which&nbsp;reopened after the cessation of the Terror. She married&nbsp;the Comte de Rémusat when she was very young, and was&nbsp;! long attached to the service of Josephine, to whom she was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
