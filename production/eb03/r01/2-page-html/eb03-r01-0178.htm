<p><span class="font3">fioners therein named ſhould be impowered to accept fo much of any future loan as they ſhould have caſh be-longing to the public to pay for. This, he ſaid, would&nbsp;relieve that diſtreſs the country would otherwiſe be under, when, on account of a war, it might be ncceſſary&nbsp;to raiſe a new Ioan : whenever that ſhoiſid be the caſe,&nbsp;his opinion was, that the miniſter ſhould not only raiſe&nbsp;taxes ſufficiently productive to pay the intereſt of the·&nbsp;loan, but alſo ſufficient to make good to the finking,&nbsp;fund whatſoever had been taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If, therefore, for inſtance, at any future period a loan of fix millions was propoſed, and there was at that time&nbsp;one million in the hands of the commiſſioners, in fuch&nbsp;caſe they ſhould take a million of the loan, and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bonus</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">douceur</span><span class="font3"> thereupon ſhould be received by them&nbsp;for the public. Thus government would only have five&nbsp;millions to borrow inſtead of fix ; and from ſueh a mode&nbsp;of proceeding, he ſaid, it was evident great benefit&nbsp;would ariſe to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This claule was received by Mr Pitt with the ſtrcngeſt marks of approbation, as was likewiſe another, moved&nbsp;by Mr Pulteney, enabling the commiſſioners named in&nbsp;the bill to continue purchafing ſtock for the public when·&nbsp;it is above par, unleſs otherwiſe directed by parliament,&nbsp;with theſe additional clauſes the bill was read a third-time on the 15th of May, and carried up to the Lords,&nbsp;where it alfo paſſed without meeting with any material&nbsp;oppoſition, and afterwards received the royal aſſent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>r</sup>Γhe operation of this bill ſurpaſſed perhaps the mi-niſter’s moſt ſanguine expectation. The fund was ably managed, and judiciouſly applied ; and in 1793 the&nbsp;commiſſioners had extinguiſhed ſome millions of■ the&nbsp;public debt. The war, however, into which the nation&nbsp;was that year involved, and of which there is yet no cer-tain proſpect of a near end, has made it neceſlary to bor-row additional ſums, ſo large, that .many years of peace&nbsp;muſt elapſe before the operation of the fund can contribute ſenſibly. to the relief of the people. The clear&nbsp;produce of the taxes raiſed on the people of this.country was, in the year; 1792, very near L.. 17,000,oco ;&nbsp;and it muſt henceforth, from the accumulation of the&nbsp;debt, and the enormous expence of the prefent war, be&nbsp;neceſſarily rendered greater.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REVERSAL </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">oſ </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Judgment,</span><span class="font3"> inlaw. A judgment may be falſiſied, reverſed, or voided, in the firſt place;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">without a writ of error,</span><span class="font3"> for matters foreign fo or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dehors&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">the record, that is, not apparent upon the face of it ;&nbsp;ſo that they cannot be affigned for error in the ſuperior&nbsp;court, which can only judge from what appears in the&nbsp;record itſelf ; and therefore, if the whole record be not&nbsp;certified, or not truly certified, by the inferior court,&nbsp;the party injured thereby (in both civil and criminal&nbsp;cafes) may allege a diminution of the record, and cauſe&nbsp;it to be rectified. Thus, if any judgment whatever be&nbsp;given by perſons who had no good commiſſion to pro-ceed againſt the perſon condemned, it is void ; and may&nbsp;be falfified by ſhewing the ſpecial matter, without writ&nbsp;of error. As, where a commiſſion iffues to A and B,&nbsp;and twelve others, or any two of them, of which A or&nbsp;B ſhall be one, to take and try indictments ; and any of&nbsp;the other twelve proceed without the interpoſition or&nbsp;preſence of either A or B : in this cafe all proceedings,&nbsp;trials, convictions, and judgments, are void for want of&nbsp;a proper authority in the commiſſioners, and may be&nbsp;falſiſied upon bare inſpection, without the trouble of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">writ of error ; it being a high miſdemeanour in the&nbsp;judges fo proceeding, and little (if any thing) ſhort of&nbsp;murder in them all, in caſe the perſon ſo attainted be&nbsp;executed and ſuffer death. So likewiſe if a man pur*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">chafes land of another ; and afterwards the vender is<sub>i </sub>either by outlawry or his own confeſſion, convicted and&nbsp;attainted of treaſon or felony previous to the ſale or&nbsp;alienation ; whereby ſuch land becomes liable to forfeit-ure or eſcheat : now, upon any trial, the purchaſer is at&nbsp;liberty, without bringing any writ of error, to falſify&nbsp;not only the time of the felony or treaſon ſuppofed, but&nbsp;the very point of the felony or treafon itſelf ; and is not&nbsp;concluded by the confeffion or the outlawry of the vender, though the vender himſelf is concluded, and not&nbsp;ſuffered now to deny the fact, which he has by confeſſion or flight acknowledged. But if ſuch attainder of&nbsp;the vender was by verdict, on the oath of his peers, the&nbsp;alienee cannot be received to falſify or contradict the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fact&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">of the crime committed ; though he is at liberty to&nbsp;prove a miſtake in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">time,οx</span><span class="font3"> that the offence was committed&nbsp;after the alienation, and not before..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Secondly, a judgment may be reverfed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by writ of error,</span><span class="font3"> which lies from all inferior criminal juriſdictions&nbsp;to the court of king’s-bench, and from the king’s-bench to the hαufe of peers ; ,and may be brought for&nbsp;notorious miſtakes in the judgment or other parts of&nbsp;the record : as where a man is found guilty of perjury,&nbsp;and receives the judgment of felony, or for other leſs&nbsp;palpable errors ; fuch as any irregularity, omiffion, or&nbsp;want of form in the proceſs of outlawry, or proclama-tions ; the want of a proper addition to the defendant’s&nbsp;name, according to the ſtatute of additions ; for not&nbsp;properly naming the ſheriff or other officer of the court,&nbsp;or not duly deſcribing where his county-court was held:&nbsp;for laying an offence, committed in the time of the late&nbsp;king, to be done againſt the peace of the preſent ; and&nbsp;for many other ſimilar. causes, which (though allowed&nbsp;out of tenderneſs to life and liberty) are not much to&nbsp;the credit or advanv⅛meffΓ of the national juſtice.—-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theſe writs of error, i⅛ reverſe judgments in caſe of.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
