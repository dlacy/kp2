<hi rend="italic">ellow</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Mallow,</hi> in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of monadelphia, and to the order of polyandria ; and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 37th order, <hi rend="italic">Columniferae.</hi> The calyx is simple and angulated ; the ſtyle is divided into many parts ; there are ſeveral capſules, each containing one feed. T here are 27 ſpecies. 1. The Spinoſa ; 2. Anguſtifolia; 3. Alba; 4. Rhombiſolia ; 5. Alnifolia ; 6. Ciliaris ; 7. Retuſa ; 8. Triquetra ; 9. Jamaicenſis ; 10. Carpinifolia ; 11.Viſcoſa; 12. Cordifolia; 13. Umbellatæ; 14. Paniculata ; 15. Atroſanguinea ; 16. Periplocifolia; 17. Urens; 18. Arborea; 19. Occidentalis ; 20. Americana; 21. Abutilon ; 22. Mauritiana ; 23. Asiatica ; 24. Indica ; 25. Criſpa ; 26. Criſtata; 27. Ternata. The firſt 18 ſpecies have 17 capſules ; the rest are multicapſular. They are all natives of warm climates ; and moſt of them are found in the Eaſt or West Indies.</p><p>The Chineſe make cords of the ſida abutilon. This plant loves water, and may be advantageouſly planted in marſhes and ditches, where nothing elſe will grow. From experiments made by the Abbé Cavanilles, a Spaniard, which are inſerted in the <hi rend="italic">Mem. de l'Acad. Royale,</hi> it appears that the plants ſucceed beſt when ſown in May, and they arrive at perfection in three months and a half. The maceration of the ſmaller ſtalks is finiſhed in about 15 days; of the larger in a month. The ſtrength and goodneſs of the thread appeared to be in proportion to the perfection of the vegetation, and to the diſtance the plant was kept at from other plants. The fibres lie in ſtrata, of which there are sometimes ſix : they are not quite ſtraight, but preſerve an undulating direction, ſo as to form a network in their natu-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0467.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0461"/>
nal positions. Their ſmell reſembles that of hemp ; the fibres are whiter, but more dry and harſh than thoſe of hemp. The harſhneſs is owing to a greeniſh gluten which connects the fibres; and the white colour muſt always be obtained at the expence of having this kind of thread leſs ſupple ; when of its natural hue, ſt is very ſoft and flexible. This deſcription belongs chiefly to the ſide ; but it will alſo apply to the malva criſpa, Peruviana, and Mauritiana. The malva criſpa gave, however, the greateſt quantity of fibres, and its gluten was moſt copious. The fibres of the ſida abutilon, and the malva criſpa, are the longeſt and the ſtrongeſt ; thoſe of the Peruviana and Mauritiana are the ſhorteſt and weakeſt. The fibres of thoſe plants which had lost their leaves are leſs ſtrong, though of equal length with thoſe which had preſerved them.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
