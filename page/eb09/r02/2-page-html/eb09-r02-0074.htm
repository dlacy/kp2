<p><span class="font1">chief sources,—the use of tawdry or ungainly compounds (διπλά </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ονόματα),</span><span class="font1"> the use of rare or obsolete words (γλώτται), and infelicity&nbsp;of epithet or metaphor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A simile </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(εlκc!&gt;v)</span><span class="font1"> is a metaphor with an explanation (λόγο?): </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., </span><span class="font1">in speaking of Achilles, “ he sprang on them like a lion ” is&nbsp;simile ; “ the lion sprang on them ” is metaphor. Simile is less&nbsp;available than metaphor for prose, being more poetical. The&nbsp;“ proportional ” metaphor mentioned here requires a passing comment. Aristotle used the term “ metaphor ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(μεταφορά)</span><span class="font1"> in a larger&nbsp;sense than ours. He meant by it “ any transference of a word to&nbsp;a sense different from its proper sense.” Thus he can distinguish&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Poet.,</span><span class="font1"> c. 21) four classes of metaphor:—(1) “from genus to&nbsp;species,” as when “vessel” means “ship”; (2) from species to&nbsp;genus, as when “the lilies of the field” stand for “flowers”&nbsp;generally. These two kinds are not what we call “metaphors,”&nbsp;but are examples of the figure which was afterwards named “ synecdoche.” Aristotle’s third class of metaphor is (3) “from species&nbsp;to species,” under which head come almost all familiar metaphors,&nbsp;as to “ scent a plot,”—the generic notion, “ find out,” being common&nbsp;to the special terms, “scent” and “detect”; (4) then lastly there&nbsp;is the “proportional” metaphor (⅞ άνάλογον), when A is not simply&nbsp;compared with B (on the strength of something obviously common&nbsp;to both), but A’s relation to C is compared with B’s relation to D.&nbsp;To call old age “ the evening of life ” implies that old age is to life&nbsp;as the evening to the day. Obviously a “ proportion ” of this kind&nbsp;is implicit in the metaphors of Aristotle’s third class ; but in the&nbsp;fourth class proportion is expressly indicated by the mention of&nbsp;the second term (“life” in our example).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first four chapters having thus dealt with expression in the narrower sense of diction (λε<sup>,</sup>ξts proper), Aristotle devotes the next&nbsp;eight (iii. 5-12) to composition, which would be properly called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σvvθεσις. -</span><span class="font1"> After remarks on the first requisites—grammatical correctness, and purity of idiom (τδ eλλτ,∙vif∈ιv)—we have some hints&nbsp;on “dignity” of style </span><span class="font0">(uγκos). </span><span class="font1">“ Propriety” (&lt;rδ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πpεποv)</span><span class="font1"> is defined&nbsp;as depending chiefly on three qualities :—(1) expression of the feelings which it is desired to move in the hearer ; (2) fitness to the&nbsp;character and position of the speaker ; and (3) congruity with the&nbsp;level of the subject. A certain “rhythm” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ρυθμός),</span><span class="font1"> or harmonious&nbsp;movement, should be sought in prose ; but this must not be so precise as to give the effect of metre. The elements of rhythm are&nbsp;“times,” i.e., in writing, long or short syllables, the short syllable&nbsp;being the unit. Here, following the early writers on music (comp.&nbsp;Plato, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rep.,</span><span class="font1"> 400 B), Aristotle recognizes three “rhythms” : (1) the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ heroic ” or dactylic,---which is in the ratio of equality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">since — = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 1 <sup>;</sup>1 j (2) the iambic or trochaic (■—■— or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">— —∙ ), which has the ratio of 2 to 1 ; (3) the pæonic, — which has the ratio of 3 : 2. Of these, the heroic is too grand for&nbsp;prose ; the iambic is too commonplace, being the very cadence&nbsp;of ordinary talk </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(αυτή εστιv ή λεξις των πολλών)</span><span class="font1"> ; the trochee is&nbsp;too comic. The pæon remains. It is the best rhythm for prose,&nbsp;since it will not, by itself, produce a metrical effect (μάλλον&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">λαvθdv∈t). </span><span class="font1">The “first” pæon (-— — is most suitable to the&nbsp;beginning of sentences, the “ fourth ” pæon ( ———— ) to the&nbsp;close. Rhythm having been attained, a framework is supplied by&nbsp;the period </span><span class="font0">(πepioδos). </span><span class="font1">A “compact” or periodic style </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(κατεστραμμένη λεξtς)</span><span class="font1"> is so called in contrast with that “running” style&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(εipομεvη λεξις)</span><span class="font1"> which simply strings clause to clause, “ having&nbsp;no necessary end until the thought is finished,” and is unpleasing&nbsp;because it is unlimited ; “for all men wish to descry the end.”&nbsp;The periodic style pleases for the opposite reason, because the&nbsp;nearer always fancies that he has grasped something and has got&nbsp;something defined. The period may consist of several parts or&nbsp;members </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(κωλa),</span><span class="font1"> or it may be “simple,” forming a unit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(αφελής,&nbsp;μοvοκωKοs).</span><span class="font1"> The rhetorical use of antithesis is then noticed in&nbsp;its application to the period. Two kindred figures are also mentioned,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">parisosis,</span><span class="font1"> a parallelism of structure between clauses of&nbsp;equal length, —and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paromoiosis,</span><span class="font1"> a resemblance in sound, when the&nbsp;last (or first) word of one clause has an echo, as it were, in the same&nbsp;place of the next clause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two chapters (10, 11) are now given to the sources of vivacity in speaking. Those “smart sayings” (τα α&lt;rτ∈Γα) which win applause&nbsp;“ must be invented by the clever or practised man ; the business of&nbsp;this treatise is to point out their use.” They come chiefly from (1)&nbsp;metaphor, (2) antithesis, and (3) vividness—ι,e., placing the thing&nbsp;described “before the eyes of the hearer” (τδ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">προ ομμάτων</span><span class="font0"> πoιe7v).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This is called by Aristotle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">εvεpyειa,</span><span class="font1"> “actuality” (which must be&nbsp;carefully distinguished from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">εv0pyειa,</span><span class="font1"> another term for “ vividness ”), since things are represented not merely in their potentiality&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(δυvαμιs), </span><span class="font1">but as living and moving. One of the most effective&nbsp;kinds of point (says Aristotle) is “a metaphor with a surprise,”&nbsp;i.e., with the disclosure of a likeness not perceived before, the&nbsp;source of the pleasure being the same as in riddles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The whole subject of expression is concluded by a chapter on the general types of style, in their relation to the three branches of&nbsp;rhetoric (ch. 12). There is a literary style </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ypaφικ⅛ λdξις)</span><span class="font1"> and a&nbsp;style suited to oral contest or debate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(αγωνιστική).</span><span class="font1"> The literary&nbsp;style is that which admits of the highest finish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ακριβέστατη),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;is best suited to the epideictic branch of rhetoric, since the latter is&nbsp;properly addressed to readers. The other, or “agonistic,” style&nbsp;is best adapted to delivery </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ΰποκριτικωτάτη).</span><span class="font1"> It is so mainly&nbsp;through two things—adaptation to the character of speaker and&nbsp;hearer, and skilful appeals to feeling. Forensic and deliberative&nbsp;rhetoric both use it ; but the forensic branch admits of higher&nbsp;finish, and so far approximates to the literary style. Deliberative&nbsp;rhetoric, on the other hand, is like drawing in light and shade&nbsp;(without colours), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σκιαγραφία—</span><span class="font1">like scene-painting, we should&nbsp;rather say, ι.e., it is meant to produce its effects at a distance,&nbsp;and will not bear looking at too closely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From expression we now pass to the other subject announced at the opening of the third book, arrangement (ταξjs), which occupies&nbsp;the last seven chapters (13-19). The received system, which had&nbsp;been popularized, if not originated, by Isocrates, recognised four&nbsp;divisions of a speech : (1) exordium (or proem), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πpοοiμιοv</span><span class="font1"> ; (2)&nbsp;narrative, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">διήγησις</span><span class="font1"> ; (3) proof, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πiστεις ;</span><span class="font1"> (4) peroration, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">επίλογος.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Aristotle adopts this fourfold partition as his basis,—with the&nbsp;preliminary remark, however, that only two elements are necessarily present in every case, viz., “statement” of one’s subject,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πp6θεσιs,</span><span class="font1"> and “argument” in its support, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πiστεις.</span><span class="font1"> He then takes&nbsp;the four divisions in order. The contents of the proem usually&nbsp;come under one of two heads—(1) exciting or allaying prejudice ;&nbsp;(2) amplifying or detracting. In epideictic rhetoric the connexion&nbsp;of proem with sequel may be comparatively loose ; it is like a flute-player’s prelude </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(προαύλιον),</span><span class="font1"> which he deftly links on to the keynote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ενδόσιμου)</span><span class="font1"> of his principal theme. The forensic proem, on&nbsp;the other hand, may be likened to the prologue of an epic or a&nbsp;tragedy (ch. 14, 15). Narrative is least needed in deliberative&nbsp;speaking, since this deals chiefly with the future. In forensic narrative, the object must be to bring out clearly the issues on which&nbsp;accuser or accused relies, with an effective colouring of ethos and&nbsp;pathos. In the epideictic branch, the narrative should not form a&nbsp;continuous whole, but should be divided and varied by comments&nbsp;(ch. 16). The rhetorician’s proofs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(πιστειs)</span><span class="font1"> will, in the forensic&nbsp;branch, be relevant to one of four issues :—(1) fact : was the alleged&nbsp;act done, or not ? (2) damage : if done, was it hurtful ? (3) criminality : if hurtful, was the hurt justifiable ? (4) quantity or degree.&nbsp;Aristotle’s four “issues ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(αμφισβητήσεις)</span><span class="font1"> here correspond with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσεις,</span><span class="font1"> “positions” or “questions,” usually three, of later legists&nbsp;and rhetoricians: (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσις στοχαστική, status eonjeeturalis,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;question of fact; (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσις όρική, statics definitivus, nomen,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">finitio,</span><span class="font1"> the question of legal definition ; (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσις ποιότητος&nbsp;status qualitatis</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">juridieialis,</span><span class="font1"> the question of justice or injustice.&nbsp;Thus Cicero says, “res (controversiam facit) aut de vero (1), aut&nbsp;de recto (3), aut de nomine” (2), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Orat.,</span><span class="font1"> xxxiv. 121. In deliberative rhetoric, the four “issues” can be applied to the future, since,&nbsp;if a speaker anticipates certain results from a course of a policy, his&nbsp;adversary can deny their (1) probability, (2) expediency, (3) justice,&nbsp;or (4) importance. The enthymeme is most useful in the deliberative branch, as the “example,” or rhetorical induction, is most&nbsp;useful in the forensic. The “ethical” proof from the speaker’s&nbsp;indicated character is always a most important adjunct to the&nbsp;logical proof (ch. 17). A chapter is now given to one special resource by which a proof can often be enforced, viz., interrogation&nbsp;of the adversary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ερωτησιs),</span><span class="font1"> which has usually one of two objects—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reductio ad absurdum,</span><span class="font1"> or (2) to entrap him into a fatal admission (ch. 18). The last chapter of the book, and of the treatise,&nbsp;deals with the peroration or “epilogue” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(επίλογος).</span><span class="font1"> This aims&nbsp;usually at one of four things :—(1) to conciliate the hearers ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to magnify or lower the importance of topics already treated ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to excite emotion in the hearers ; (4) to refresh their memories&nbsp;by a short recapitulation. Remarking that asyndeton gives force&nbsp;to the close of an epilogue, Aristotle ends his rhetoric with the&nbsp;last words (not quite accurately quoted) of the great speech in which&nbsp;Lysias denounced Eratosthenes—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">παΰσομαι κατήγορων. άκηκόατε,&nbsp;εωράκατε, πεπόνθατε, εχετε, δικάζετε.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> is incomparably the most scientific work which exists on the subject. It may also be regarded&nbsp;as having determined the main lines on which the subject&nbsp;was treated by nearly all subsequent writers. The extant&nbsp;treatise on rhetoric entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wgτopuκp</span><span class="font2"> 7rpos *Aλ∈'ξαvδpov&nbsp;was undoubtedly by Anaximenes of Lampsacus, and was&nbsp;probably composed about 340-330 b.c., a few years before&nbsp;Aristotle’s work. The introductory letter prefixed to it is&nbsp;a late forgery. If the treatise of Anaximenes is compared&nbsp;with that of Aristotle the distinctive place of the latter&nbsp;in this field becomes clearer. Anaximenes, who knew the&nbsp;treatise of Isocrates, and could profit by all the preceding&nbsp;Greek “arts,” is, for us, the sole representative of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">technical&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">rhetoric before Aristotle, and probably represents it at its&nbsp;best. We miss the intellectual power, the grasp of&nbsp;principles, and the subtle discrimination which belong to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
