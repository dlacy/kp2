<p><span class="font0">fested in the case of Theophylact, was repeated in those of Alberic, Brancaleone, Crescenzio, Cola di Rienzo, and&nbsp;others. One of the many causes of this tendency may be&nbsp;traced to the conception of the new empire of which Rome&nbsp;was the original and enduring fountainhead. As Rome&nbsp;had once transferred the empire from Byzantium to the&nbsp;Franks, so Rome was surely entitled to reclaim it. The&nbsp;imperial authority was represented by the office of patrician, now virtually assumed by Alberic. That he gave&nbsp;the name of Octavian to his son is an additional proof of&nbsp;this fact. In the Eternal City the mediæval political idea&nbsp;has always the aspect of a resurrection or transformation&nbsp;of classic antiquity. This is another characteristic of the&nbsp;history of the Roman commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alberic’s strength was due to his connexion with the nobility, to his father’s valiant service against the Saracens&nbsp;at the battle of Garigliano, and to the militia under&nbsp;his command, on which everything depended amid the&nbsp;internal and external dangers now threatening the new&nbsp;state. As yet no genuine municipal constitution was&nbsp;possible in Rome, w<sup>τ</sup>here neither the people nor the&nbsp;wealthy burghers engaged in industry and commerce had&nbsp;any fixed organization. All was in the hands of the&nbsp;nobles, and Alberic, as their chief, frequently convened&nbsp;them in council, although obliged to use pressure to keep&nbsp;them united and avoid falling a prey to their disputes.&nbsp;Hence the whole power was concentrated in his grasp ; he&nbsp;was at the head of the tribunals as well as of the army.&nbsp;The judices de clero and judices de militia still existed,&nbsp;but no longer met in the Lateran or the Vatican, under the&nbsp;presidency of emperor and pope or their missi. Alberic&nbsp;himself was their president ; and, a still more significant&nbsp;fact, their sittings were often held in his private dwelling.&nbsp;There is no longer any mention of prefect or patricius.&nbsp;The papal coinage w<sup>τ</sup>as inscribed with Alberic’s name&nbsp;instead of the emperor’s. His chief attention was given to&nbsp;the militia, which was still arranged in scholae, and it is&nbsp;highly probable that he was the author of the new division&nbsp;of the city into twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regions,</span><span class="font0"> with a corresponding classification of the army in as many regiments under twelve&nbsp;flags and twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">baηderesi,</span><span class="font0"> one for every region. The&nbsp;organization of the scholae could not have been very&nbsp;dissimilar, but doubtless Alberic had some important&nbsp;motive for altering the old method of classification. By&nbsp;means of the armed regions he included the people in the&nbsp;forces. It is certain that after his time we find the army&nbsp;much changed and far more democratic. It was only&nbsp;natural that so excellent a statesman should seek the aid&nbsp;of the popular element as a defence against the arrogance&nbsp;of the nobles, and it was requisite to reinforce the army&nbsp;in order to be prepared for the attacks threatened from&nbsp;abroad. This change effected, Alberic felt prepared for&nbsp;the worst, and began to rule with energy, moderation, and&nbsp;justice. His contemporaries award him high praise, and&nbsp;he seems to have been exempt from the vices of his mother&nbsp;and grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 933 Hugo made his first attack upon the city, and w<sup>r</sup>as repulsed. A second attempt in 936 proved&nbsp;still more unfortunate, for his army was decimated by a&nbsp;pestilence. Thoroughly disheartened, he not only made&nbsp;peace, but gave his daughter in marriage to Alberic,&nbsp;thus satisfying the latter’s desire to ally himself with a&nbsp;royal house. But this union led to no conciliation with&nbsp;Hugo. For Alberic, finding his power increased, marched&nbsp;at the head of his troops to consolidate his rule in the&nbsp;Campagna and the Sabine land. On the death of his&nbsp;brother, Pope John XI., in 936, he controlled the election of several successive popes, quelled a conspiracy&nbsp;formed against him by the clergy and certain nobles instigated by Hugo, and brilliantly repulsed, in 941, another&nbsp;attack by that potentate. At last, however, this inveterate foe withdrew from Rome, being summoned to the&nbsp;north by the victories of his rival Berengarius. But&nbsp;Alberic, after procuring the election of various popes&nbsp;who were docile instruments of his will, experienced a&nbsp;check when Agapetus H. (946-955), a man of firmness&nbsp;and resource, was raised to the papal throne. The fortunes&nbsp;of Berengarius were now in the ascendant. In 950 he&nbsp;had seized the iron crown, and ruled in the Pentapolis&nbsp;and the exarchate. This being singularly painful to the&nbsp;pope, he proceeded to make alliance with all those enemies&nbsp;of Berengarius preferring a distant emperor to a neighbouring and effective sovereign, with the Roman nobles&nbsp;who were discontented with Alberic, and with all who&nbsp;foresaw danger, even to Rome, from the extended power&nbsp;of Berengarius. And Agapetus recurred to the old papal&nbsp;policy, by making appeal to Otho I., whose rule in Germany was distinguished by a prestige almost comparable&nbsp;with that of Charlemagne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Otho immediately responded to the appeal and descended into Italy; but his envoys were indignantly repulsed by&nbsp;Alberic, and, being prudent as well as firm, he decided to&nbsp;wait a more opportune moment for the accomplishment&nbsp;of his designs. Meanwhile Alberic died in 954, and the&nbsp;curtain fell on the first great drama of the Roman republic.&nbsp;He had reigned for twenty-two years with justice, energy,&nbsp;and prudence ; he had repelled foreign invaders, maintained order and authority. He seems, however, to have&nbsp;realized that the aspect of affairs was about to change,&nbsp;that the work he had accomplished would be exposed to&nbsp;new dangers. These dangers, in fact, had already begun&nbsp;with the accession of an enterprising pope to the Holy See.&nbsp;The name of Octavian given by Alberic to his son leads&nbsp;to the inference that he meant to make his power&nbsp;hereditary. But, suddenly, he began to educate this son&nbsp;for the priesthood, and, assembling the nobles in StBeteFs&nbsp;shortly before his death, he made them swear to elect&nbsp;Octavian as pope on the decease of Agapetus II. They&nbsp;kept their word, for in this way they freed themselves&nbsp;from a ruler. Possibly Alberic trusted that both offices&nbsp;might be united, and that his son would be head of the&nbsp;state as well as the church. But the nobles knew this to&nbsp;be a delusion, especially in the case of a nature such as&nbsp;Octavian’s. The lad w<sup>,</sup>as sixteen years old when his father&nbsp;died, received princely honours until the death of&nbsp;Agapetus, and w<sup>τ</sup>as then elected pope with the name of&nbsp;John XII. He had inherited the ungoverned passions of&nbsp;his grandmother Marozia and great-grandmother Theodora,&nbsp;but without their intelligence and cunning. His palace&nbsp;was the scene of the most scandalous licence, while his&nbsp;public acts were those of a baby tyrant. He conferred&nbsp;a bishopric on a child of ten, consecrated a deacon in a&nbsp;stable, invoked Venus and Jupiter in his games, and&nbsp;drank to the devil’s health. He desired to be both pope&nbsp;and prince, but utterly failed to be either. Before long,&nbsp;realizing the impossibility of holding in check Berengarius,&nbsp;who still ruled over the exarchate, he sought in 960 the&nbsp;aid of Otho L, and promised him the imperial crown.&nbsp;Thus the new ruler was summoned by the son of the man&nbsp;by whom he had been repulsed. Otho vowed to defend&nbsp;the church, to restore her territories, to refrain from&nbsp;usurping the power of the pope or the republic, and was&nbsp;crowned on the 2d February 962 with unheard-of pomp&nbsp;and display.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Accordingly, after being extinct for thirty-seven years, the empire was revived under different but no less difficult conditions. The politico-religious unity founded by&nbsp;Charlemagne had been dissolved, partly on account of the&nbsp;heterogeneous elements of which it was composed, and&nbsp;partly because other nations were in course of formation.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
