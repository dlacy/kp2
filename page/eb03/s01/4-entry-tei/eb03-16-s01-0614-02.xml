the <hi rend="smallcaps">Salmon</hi>; a genus of the order of abdominales. The head is ſmooth, and furniſhed with teeth and a tongue; the rays of the gills are from four to ten; the back-fin is fat behind; and the belly-fins have many rays. There are 29 ſpecies; of which the moſt remarkable are,</p><p>I. The ſalar, or common ſalmon, is a northern fiſh, being unknown in the Mediterranean ſea and other warm climates: it is found in France in ſome of the rivers that empty themſelves into the ocean, and north as far as Greenland; they are alſo very common in Newfoundland, and the northern parts of North America. Salmons are taken in the rivers of Kamtſchatka; but whether they are of the ſame ſpecies with the European kind, is not very certain. They are in ſeveral countries a great article oſ commerce, being cured different ways, by ſalting, pickling, and drying: there are ſtationary ſiſheries in Iceland, Norway, and the Baltic; but we believe nowhere greater than thoſe at Colraine in Ireland; and in Great Britain at Berwick, and in ſome of the rivers of Scotland. In the Hiſtory of Cumberland, we are told that “they depoſit their ſpawn even on the upper fide of Pooley-bridge, but always in the ſtream of Eamont. At thoſe times it is not an eaſy matter to drive them away by throwing ſtones at them. They will take a bait of roe, or ſmalt fiſh, while upon the rudd, or laying their ſpawn. We have never heard of a ſalmon or ſalmon ſmelt being ſeen in the lake. They go up the river Derwent in September, through the lake of Baſſenthwaite, up the river which runs through Keſwick into the vale of St John, where they depoſit their ſpawn in the ſmall ſtreams and feeders of the lake. The young ſalmon are called <hi rend="italic">ſalmon ſmeits,</hi> and go down to the ſea with the firſt floods in May. ”</p><p>The ſalmon was known to the Romans, but not to the Greeks. Pliny fpeaks of it as a fiſh found in the rivers of Aquitaine: Auſonius enumerates it among thoſe of the Moſel. The ſalmon is a fiſh that lives both in the ſalt and freſh waters; quitting the ſea at certain ſeaſons for the ſake of depoſiting its ſpawn, in ſecurity, in the gravelly beds of rivers remote from their mouths. There are ſcarce any difficulties but what they will overcome, in order to arrive at places fit for<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0621.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0615"/>
their purpoſe: they will aſcend rivers hundreds of miles, force themſelves againſt the moſt rapid ſtreams, and ſpring with amazing agility over cataracts of ſeveral feet in height. Salmon are frequently taken in the Rhine as high up as Baſil; they gain the ſources of the Lapland rivers in ſpite of their torrent-like currents, and ſurpaſs the perpendicular falls of Leixſlip, Kennerth, and Pont Aberglaſtyn. It may here be proper to contradict the vulgar error, of their taking their tail in their mouth when they attempt to leap; ſuch as Mr Pennant ſaw, ſprung up quite ſtraight, and with a ſtrong tremulous motion.</p><p>The ſalmon is a fiſh ſo generally known, that a very brief deſcription will ſerve. The largeſt we ever heard of weighed 74 pounds. The colour of the back and ſides are grey, ſometimes ſpotted with black, ſometimes plain: the covers of the gills are ſubject to the ſame variety; the belly ſilvery; the noſe ſharp-pointed; the end of the under jaw in the males often turns up in the form of a hook; ſometimes this curvature is very conſiderable: it is ſaid that they loſe this hook when they return to the ſea. The teeth are lodged in the jaws and on the tongue, and are ſlender, but very ſharp; the tail is a little forked.</p><p>2. The trutta, or ſea-trout, migrates like the true ſalmon up ſeveral of our rivers; ſpawns, and returns to the ſea. That deſcribed by Mr Pennant was taken in the Tweed below Berwick, June 1769. The ſhape was more thick than the common trout; the weight three pounds two ounces. The irides ſilver; the head thick, ſmooth, and duſky, with a gloſs of blue and green; the back of the ſame colour, which grows fainter towards the ſide-line. The back is plain, but the ſides, as far as the lateral line, are marked with large diſtinct irregularly-ſhaped ſpots of black: the lateral line ſtraight; the ſides beneath the line, and the belly, are white. Tail broad, and even at the end. The dorſal fin had 12 rays; the pectoral 14; the ventral 9; the anal 10. The fleſh when boiled is of a pale red, but well-flavoured.</p><p>3. The fario, or trout; the colours of which vary greatly in different waters, and in different, ſeaſons. Trouts differ alſo in fize. One taken in Llynallet, Denbighſhire, which is famous for an excellent kind, meaſured t 7 inches, its depth three and three quarters, its weight one pound ten ounces; the head thick; the noſe rather ſharp; the upper jaw a little longer than the lower; both jaws, as well as the head, were of a pale brown, blotched with black; the teeth ſharp and ſtrong, diſpoſed in the jaws, roof of the mouth, and tongue. The back wag duſky; the ſides tinged with a purpliſh bloom, marked with deep purple ſpots, mixed with black above and below the ſide-line, which was ſtraight; the belly white. The ſirſt dorſal ſin was ſpotted; the ſpurious ſin brown, tipped with, red; the pectoral, ventral, and anal ſins, of a pale brown; the edges of the anal ſin white; the tail very little forked when extended. —The ſtomachs of the common trouts are uncommonly thick and muſcular. They feed on the ſhell-fish of lakes and rivers, as well as on small fiſh. They likewiſe take into their ſtomachs gravel or ſmall ſtones, to aſſiſt in comminuting, the teſtaceous parts of their food. The trouts of certain lakes in Ireland; ſuch as thoſe of the province of Galway and ſome others, are remarkable for the great thickneſs of their ſtomachs, which, from ſome flight reſemblance to the organs of digeſtion in birds, have been called <hi rend="italic">gizzards;</hi> the Iriſh name the ſpecies that has them <hi rend="italic">gillαroo trouts.</hi> Theſe ſtomachs are ſometimes ſerved up to table under the former appellation. Trouts are moſt voracious ſiſh, and afford excellent diverſion to the angler. The paſſion for the ſport of angling is ſo great in the neighbourhood of London, that the liberty of ſiſhing in ſome of the ſtreams in the adjacent counties is purchaſed at the rate of 101. <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi> Theſe fiſh ſhiſt their quarters to ſpawn; and, like ſalmon, make up toward» the heads of rivers to depoſit their roes. The under jaw of the trout is ſubject, at certain times, to the ſame curvature as that of the ſalmon.</p><p>“It is caught (fay the editors of the Hiſtory of Cumberland) in very great plenty at all ſeaſons of the year; one weighing a pound and a half is an uſual ſize, though ſome are caught of 4 lb. weight. Five or ſix ounces is a common weight; the largeſt are commonly the bell for the table, when they cut of a deep ſalmon colour. In the winter months great quantities are potted along with the charre, and ſent to London, &amp;c. — The angler, on a favourable day, here enjoys his diverſion in higher perfection than in moſt places. A trout occaſionally ſtrays out of the Eamont into the lake, and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa,</hi> out of the lake into the river. They are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their ſpots; and it is obſerved, that a fish taken from its uſual place is not in ſo good a condition as one of equal length taken on its own ground; hence it is probable, that they do not, emigrate, except when diſeaſed or ſpawning. Geld fiſh (thoſe without ſpawn) are the firmeſt and beſt. They have been taken out of a ſolid piece of ice, in which they were frozen, as it were in a cafe, perfectly uninjured, after an impriſonment of ſeveral hours. ”</p><p>4. The ſpecies, called, from its colour the <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> migrates out of the ſea into the river Elk in Cumberland, from July to September. When dreſſed, their fleſh is red, and moſt delicious eating. They have, on their ſirſt appearance from the ſalt water, the <hi rend="italic">lernaea ſalmonea,</hi> or ſalmon louſe, adhering to them. They have both milt and ſpawn; but no fry has as yet been obſerved. This is the fiſh called by the Scots <hi rend="italic">phinocs.</hi> They never exceed a foot in length. The upper jaw is a little longer than the lower; in the firſt are two rows of teeth, in the laſt one: on the tongue are fix, teeth. The back is ſtraight: the whole body of an elegant form: the lateral line is ſtraight; colour, between that and the top of the back, duſky and ſilvery intermixed; beneath the line, of an exquiſite whiteneſs; firſt dorſal fin ſpotted with black: tail black, and much forked.</p><p>5. The ſamlet is the leaſt of the trout kind; is frequent in the Wye, in the upper part of the Severn, and the rivers that run into it, in the north of England, and in Wales. It is by ſeveral imagined to be the fry of the ſahnon; but Mr Pennant diſſents from that opinion. See his <hi rend="italic">Brit. Zool.</hi> III. 303.</p><p>This ſpecies has a general reſemblance to the trout, therefore muſt be deſcribed comparatively. <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> The head is proportionably narrower, and the mouth leſs than that of the trout. <hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> Their body is deeper. <hi rend="italic">3dly,</hi> They ſeldom exceed fix or ſeyen inches in length; at. moſt, eight and a half, <hi rend="italic">4thly</hi> The pectoral fins have<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0622.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0616"/>
generally but one large black ſpot, though ſometimes a ſingle ſmall one attends it; whereas the pectoral fins of the trout are more numerouſly marked. <hi rend="italic">6thly,</hi> The ſpurious or fat fin on the back is never tipped with red; nor is the edge of the anal fin white. <hi rend="italic">6thly,</hi> The ſpots on the body are fewer, and not ſo bright: it is alſo marked from the back to the ſides with fix or ſeven large bluiſh bars; but this is not a certain character, as the fame is ſometimes found in young trouts. <hi rend="italic">7thly,</hi> The tail of the ſamlet is much more forked than that of the trout. Theſe fi <hi rend="italic">fkirfιnsts,</hi> h are very frequent in the rivers of Scotland, where they are called <hi rend="italic">pars.</hi> They are alſo common in the Wye, where they are known by the name of <hi rend="italic">ſkirlings,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">laſprings.</hi></p><p>6. The alpinus, or red charr (umbla minor, or caſe charr of Pennant), is an inhabitant of the lakes of the north, and of thoſe of the mountainous parts of Europe. It affects clear and pure waters, and is very rarely known to wander into running ſtreams, except into ſuch whoſe bottom is ſimilar to the neighbouring lake. It is found in vaſt abundance in the cold lakes on the ſummits of the Lapland Alps, and is almoſt the only fiſh that is met with in any plenty in thoſe regions; where it would be wonderful bow they ſubſiſted, had not Providence ſupplied them with innumerable larvæ of the gnat kind: theſe are food to the fiſh, who in their turn are a ſupport to the migratory Laplanders, in their ſummer voyages to the diſtant lake. In ſuch excurſions thoſe vacant people find a luxurious and ready repaſt in theſe fiſh, which they dreſs and eat without the addition of ſauces; for exer- ciſe and temperance render uſeleſs the inventions of epi- curiſm. There are but few lakes in our iſland that produce this fiſh; and even thoſe not in any abundance. It is found in Ullſwater and Windermere in Weſtmoreland; in Llyn Quellyn, near the foot of Snowdon; and, before the diſcovery of the copper- mines, in thoſe of Llynberris; but the mineral ſtreams have entirely deſtroyed the fiſh in the laſt lakes. In Scotland it is found in Loch Inch, and other neighbouring lakes, and is ſaid to go into the Spey to ſpawn.</p><p>“The largeſt and moſt beautiful we ever received (ſays Mr Pennant) were taken in Windermere, and were communicated by the Rev. Mr Fariſh of Carliſle, with an account of their natural hiſtory. He ſent five ſpecimens; two under the name of the <hi rend="italic">caſe charr,</hi> male and female; another he called the <hi rend="italic">geld charr,</hi> i. e. a charr which had not ſpawned the preceding ſeaſon, and on that account is reckoned to be in the greateſt perfection. The two others were inſcribed, the <hi rend="italic">red charr,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">ſilver</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gild charr,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">carpia lacus benaci,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Raii</hi> <hi rend="italic">Syn. Piſc.</hi> 66. which laſt are in Weſtmoreland diſtinguiſhed by the epithet <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> by reaſon of the fleſh aſſuming a higher colour than the other when dreſſed.</p><p>“The umbla minor, or caſe charr, ſpawns about Michaelmas, and chiefly in the river Brathy, which uniting with another called the <hi rend="italic">Rowthay,</hi> about a quarter of a mile above the lake, they both fall into it together. The Brathy has a black rocky bottom; the bottom of the Row thay is a bright ſand, and into this the charr are never obſerved to enter. Some of them, however, ſpawn in the lake; but always in ſuch parts of it which are ſtony, and reſemble the channel of the Brathy. They are ſuppoſed to be in the higheſt perſection about May, and continue ſo alt the ſummer; yet are rarely caught after April. When they are ſpawning in the river they will take a bait, but at no other time; being commonly taken, as well as the other ſpecies, in what they <hi rend="italic">breast-nests,</hi> which are in length about 24 fathoms, and about five where broadeſt. — The ſeaſon which the other ſpecies ſpawn in is from the beginning of January to the end of March. They are never known to aſcend the rivers, but always in thoſe parts of the lake which are ſpringy, where the bottom is ſmooth and ſandy, and the water warmeſt. The ſiſhermen judge of this warmth, by obſerving that the water ſeldom freezes in the places where they ſpawn except in intenſe froſts, and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake. They are taken in greateſt plenty from the end of September to the end of November; at other times they are hardly to be met with. This ſpecies is much more eſteemed for the table than the other, and is very delicate when potted. The length of the red charr to the diviſion in its tail was 12 inches; its biggeſt circumference almoſt 7. The firſt dorſal fin was five inches and three quarters from the tip of its noſe, and conſiſted of 12 branched rays, the firſt of which was ſhort, the fifth the longeſt; the fat fin was very ſmall. Each of the five fiſh had double noſtrils, and ſmall teeth in the jaws, roof of the mouth, and on the tongue. —The jaws of the caſe-charr are perfectly even; on the contrary, thoſe of the red-charr were unequal, the upper jaw being the broadeſt, and the teeth hung over the lower, as might be perceived on paſſing the finger over them. —The geld or barren charr was rather more ſlender than the others, as being without ſpawn. The back was of a gloſſy duſky blue; the ſides ſilvery, mixed with blue, ſpotted with pale red; the ſides of the belly were of a pale red, the bottom white. The tails of each bifurcated. ”</p><p>7. The thymallus, or grayling, haunts clear and rapid ſtreams, and particularly thoſe that flow through mountainous countries. It is found in the rivers of Derbyſhire; in ſome of thoſe of the north; in the Tame near Ludlow; in the Lug, and other ſtreams near Leominſter; and in the river near Chriſtchursh, Hampſhire. It is alſo very common in Lapland: the inhabitants make life of the guts of this fiſh inſtead of rennet, to make the cheeſe which they get from the milk of the rein-deer. It is a voracious fiſh, riſes freely to the fly, and will very eagerly take a bait. It is a very ſwift ſwimmer, and diſappears like the tranſient paſſage of a ſhadow, from whence we believe it derived the name of <hi rend="italic">umbra.</hi></p><p>Effugienſque oculos celeri levis <hi rend="italic">umbra</hi> natatu. <hi rend="italic">Auſon,</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">umbra</hi> ſwift eſcapes the quickeſt eye.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Thymalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thymus</hi> are names beſtowed on it on account of the imaginary ſcent, compared by ſome to that of thyme; but we never could perceive any particular ſmell. It is a fiſh of an elegant form; leſs deep than that of a trout: the largeſt we ever heard of was taken near Ludlow, which was about half a yard long, and weighed four pounds fix ounces; but this was a very rare inſtance. The irides are ſilvery, tinged with yellow: the teeth very minute, ſeated in the jaws and the roof of the mouth, but none on the tongue: the head is duſky; the covers of the gills of a gloſſy green: the back and ſides of a fine ſilvery grey; but when the fiſh is juft<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0623.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0617"/>
taken, varied ſlightly with blue and gold: the ſide-line is ſtraight: the ſcales are large, and the lower edges duſky, forming ſtraight rows from head to tail: the tail is much forked.</p><p>8. The eperlanus, or ſmelt, inhabits the ſeas of the northern parts of Europe, and probably never is found as far ſouth as the Mediterranean: the Seine is one of the French rivers which receive it; but whether it is found ſouth of that, we have not at preſent authority to fay. If we can depend on the obſervations of navigators, who generally have too much to think of to attend to the minutiae of natural hiſtory, theſe fiſh are taken in the Straits of Magellan, and of a moſt ſurprifing ſize, ſome meaſuring 20 inches in length and 8 in circumference. They inhabit the ſeas that waſh theſe iſlands the whole year, and never go very remote from ſhore except when they aſcend the rivers. It is remarked in certain rivers, that they appear a long time before they ſpawn, being taken in great abundance in November, December, and January, in the Thames and Dee, but in others not till February; and in March and April they ſpawn; after which they all return to the ſalt water, and are not ſeen in the rivers till the next ſeaſon. It has been obſerved that they never come into the Merſey as long as there is any ſnow-water in the river. Theſe fiſh vary greatly in ſize; but the largeſt we ever heard of was 13 inches long, and weighed half a pound. They have a very particular ſcent, from whence is derived one of their Engliſh names, <hi rend="italic">ſmelt</hi>, i. e. ſmell it. That of <hi rend="italic">sparling,</hi> which is uſed in Wales and the north of England, is taken from the French <hi rend="italic">ſperlan.</hi> There is a wonderful diſagreement in the opinion of people in reſpect to the ſcent of this fiſh: ſome aſſert it flavours of the violet; the Germans, for a very different rea- ſon, diſtinguiſh it by the elegant title of <hi rend="italic">ſtinckfiſch,</hi> —Smelts are often fold in the ſtreets of London ſplit and dried. They are called <hi rend="italic">dried /partings;</hi> and are recommended as a reliſh to a glaſs of wine in the morning. It is a fiſh of a very beautiful form and colour; the head is tranſparent, and the ſkin in general ſo thin, that with a good microſcope the blood may be obſerved to circulate. The irides are ſilvery; the pupil of a full black; the under jaw is the longeſt: in the front of the upper jaw are four large teeth; thoſe in the ſides of both are ſmall; in the roof of the mouth are two rows of teeth; on the tongue two others of large teeth. The ſcales are ſmall, and readily drop off: the tail conſiſts of 19 rays, and is forked. The colour of the back is whitiſh, with a caſt of green, beneath which it is varied with blue, and then ſucceeds a beautiful gloſs of a ſilvery hue.</p><p>9. The lavaretus, or gwiniad, is an inhabitant of ſeveral of the lakes of the Alpine parts of Europe. It is found in thoſe of Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy; of Norway, Sweden, Lapland, and Scotland; in thoſe of Ireland, and of Cumberland; and in Wales, in that of Llyntegid, near Bala, in Merionethſhire. It is the ſame with the ferra of the lake of Geneva; the ſchelly of Hulſe-water; the pollen of Lough Neagh; and the vangis and juvengis of Loch Mabon. In Scotland there is a tradition that it was firſt introduced there by their beauteous but unfortunate queen, Mary Stuart; and as in her time the Scotch court was much Frenchified, it ſeems likely that the name was derived from the French <hi rend="italic">vendoiſe,</hi> a “dace; ” to which a flight obſerver might be tempted to compare it from the whiteneſs of its ſcales. The Britiſh name <hi rend="italic">gwiniad,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">whiting,</hi> was beſtowed upon it for the ſame reaſon. It is a gregarious fiſh, and approaches the ſhores in vaſt ſhoals in ſpring and in ſummer; which proves in many places a bleſſed relief to the poor of inland countries, in the ſame degree as the annual return of the herring is to thoſe who inhabit the coaſts. Between 7000 and 8000 have been taken at one draught. The gwiniad is a fiſh of an inſipid taſte, and muſt be eaten ſoon, for it will not keep long; thoſe that chooſe to preſerve them do it with falt. They die very ſoon after they are taken. Their ſpawning ſeaſon in Llyntegid is in December. The largeſt gwiniad we ever heard of weighed between three and four pounds: the head is ſmall, ſmooth, and of a duſky hue: the eyes very large; the pupil of a deep blue: the noſe blunt at the end; the jaws of equal length: the mouth ſmall and toothleſs: the branchioſtegous rays nine: the covers of the gills ſilvery, powdered with black. The back is a little arched, and ſlightly carinated: the colour, as far as the lateral line, is gloſſed with deep blue and purple; but towards the lines aſſumes a ſilvery caſt, tinged with gold; beneath which thoſe colours entirely prevail. The tail is very much forked: the ſcales are large, and adhere cloſe to the body.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
