(George Erneſt), an eminent German chemiſt, was born in Franconia in 1660, and choſen profeſſor of medicine at Hall, when a univerſity was founded in that city in 1694. The excellency of his lectures while he filled that chair, the importance of his various publications, and his extenſive practice, soon raiſed his reputation to a very great height. He received an invitation to Berlin in 1716, which having accepted, he was made counſellor of ſtate and phyſician to the king. He died in 1734, in the 75th year of his age. Stahl is without doubt one of the greateſt men of which the annals of medicine can boaſt : his name marks the commencement of a new and more illustrious era in chemiſtry. He was the author of the doctrine of phlogiſton, which, though now completely overturned by the diſcoveries of Lavoiſier and others, was not without its uſe ; as it ſerved to combine the ſcattered fragments of former chemiſts into a ſyſtem, and as it gave riſe to more accurate expcriments and a more ſcientific view of the ſubject, to which many of the ſubſequent diſcoveries were owing. This theory maintained its ground for more than half a century, and was received and ſupported by ſome of the moſt eminent men which Europe has produced ; a ſufficient proof of the ingenuity and the abilities of its author. He was the author alſo of A Theory of Medicine, founded upon the notions which he entertained of the absolute dominion of mind over body ; in conſequence of which, he affirmed, that every muſcular action is a voluntary act of the mind, whether attended with conſciousneſs or not. This theory he and his followers carried a great deal too far, but the advices at leaſt which he gives to attend to the ſtate of the mind of the patient are worthy of the attention of phyſicians.</p><p>His principal works are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Experimenta et Observaciones Chemica et Physicae,</hi> Berlin, 1731, 8vo. 2. <hi rend="italic">Dissertationes Medica,</hi> Hall, 2 vols 4t0.
