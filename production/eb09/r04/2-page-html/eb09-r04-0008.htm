        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tundras</span><span class="font0"> in the
                far north,—their monotonous surfaces are diversified by only a few, and these for
                most part low,&nbsp;hilly tracts. Recently emerged from the Post-Pliocene&nbsp;sea,
                or cleared of their ice-sheet coverings, they preserve&nbsp;the very same features
                over immense stretches; and the&nbsp;few portions that rise above the general
                elevation have&nbsp;more the character of broad and gentle swellings than&nbsp;of
                mountain-chains. Of this class are the swampy plateaus&nbsp;of the Kola peninsula,
                gently sloping southwards to&nbsp;the lake-regions of Finland and north-west Russia;
                the&nbsp;λ'aldai table-lands, where all the great rivers of Russia&nbsp;take their
                rise ; the broad and gently-sloping meridional&nbsp;belt of the Ural Mountains ; and
                lastly, the Taimyr,&nbsp;Tunguska, and Verkhoyansk ridges in Siberia, which
                do&nbsp;not reach the snow-line, notwithstanding their sub-Arctic&nbsp;position. As
                to the picturesque Bureya mountains on the&nbsp;Amur, the forest-clothed
                Sikhota-alin on the Pacific, and&nbsp;the volcanic chains of Kamchatka, they belong
                to quite&nbsp;another orographical world; they are the border-ridges of&nbsp;the
                terraces by which the great plateau-belt descends to&nbsp;the depths of the Pacific
                Ocean.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">It is owing to these leading orographical features— divined by Carl
                Ritter, but only within the present day&nbsp;revealed by geographical research—that
                so many of the&nbsp;great rivers of the old continent are comprised within
                the&nbsp;limits of the Russian empire. Taking rise on the plateau-belt, or in its
                Alpine outskirts, they flow, first, like the&nbsp;upper Rhone and Rhine, along high
                longitudinal valleys&nbsp;formerly filled up with great lakes; next they find
                their&nbsp;way through the rocky walls ; and finally they enter the&nbsp;lowlands,
                where they become navigable, and, describing&nbsp;great curves to avoid here and
                there the minor plateaus&nbsp;and hilly tracts, they bring into
                water-communication&nbsp;with one another places thousands of miles apart.
                The&nbsp;double river-systems of the Volga and Kama, the Obi and&nbsp;Irtish, the
                Angara and Yenisei, the Lena and Vitim on&nbsp;the Arctic slope, the Amur and
                Sungari on the Pacific&nbsp;slope, are instances. They were the true channels
                of&nbsp;Russian colonization.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">A broad depression,—the Aral-Caspian desert—has arisen where the
                plateau-belt has reached its greatest&nbsp;height and suddenly changes its direction
                from a northwestern into a north-eastern one; this desert is now filled&nbsp;only to
                a small extent by the salt waters of the Caspian,&nbsp;Aral, and Balkash inland seas
                ; but it bears unmistakable&nbsp;traces of having been during Post-Pliocene times an
                immense inland basin. There the Volga, the Ural, the Sir&nbsp;Daria, and the Oxus
                discharge their waters without reaching&nbsp;the ocean, but continue to bring life
                to the rapidly drying&nbsp;Transcaspian Steppes, or connect by their river network,
                as&nbsp;the Volga does, the most remote parts of European Russia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The above-described features of the physical geography of the empire
                explain the relative uniformity of this wide&nbsp;territory, in conjunction with the
                variety of physical&nbsp;features on its outskirts. They explain also the
                rapidity&nbsp;of the expansion of Slavonic colonization over these
                thinly&nbsp;peopled regions ; and they also throw light upon the&nbsp;internal
                cohesion of the empire, which cannot fail to strike&nbsp;the traveller as he crosses
                this immense territory, and finds&nbsp;everywhere the same dominating race, the same
                features&nbsp;of life. In fact, in their advance from the basins of
                the&nbsp;Volkhoff and Dnieper to the foot of the Altai and Sayan&nbsp;Mountains,
                that is, along nearly a quarter of the earth’s&nbsp;circumference, the Russian
                colonizers could always find the&nbsp;same physical conditions, the same forests and
                prairies as&nbsp;they had left at home, the same facilities for
                agriculture,&nbsp;only modified somewhat by minor topographical features.&nbsp;New
                conditions of climate and soil, and consequently new&nbsp;cultures and
                civilizations, the Russians met with, in their&nbsp;expansion towards the south and
                east, only beyond the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Caucasus, in the Aral-Caspian region, and in the basin of the Usuri
                on the Pacific coast. Favoured by these conditions, the Russians not only conquered
                northern Asia—&nbsp;they colonized it.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The total population of the Russian empire was stated at 102,000,000
                by estimates made in 1878-82; but it is&nbsp;multiplying rapidly, and, as the
                surplus of births over&nbsp;deaths reaches nearly 1,250,000 every year, it must
                now&nbsp;be somewhat more than 106 millions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Within the empire a very great diversity of nationalities is
                comprised, due to the amalgamation or absorption by&nbsp;the Slavonian race of a
                variety of Ural-Altaic stems, of&nbsp;Turco-Tartars, Turco-Mongolians, and various
                Caucasian&nbsp;stems. Statistics as to their relative strength are still&nbsp;very
                imperfect, and their ethnical relations have not as yet&nbsp;been completely
                determined ; but, considered broadly, they&nbsp;may be classified as
                follows:—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Letto-Slavonians comprise (</span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">) the
                Lithuanians&nbsp;and Letts on the lower Niemen and Düna, and (</span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">)
                the&nbsp;Slavonians, that is, the Poles on the Vistula and Niemen&nbsp;and the
                Russians—Great, Little, and White—whose&nbsp;proper abodes are in European Russia,
                south of a line&nbsp;drawn from the Gulf of Finland to the middle
                Volga.&nbsp;Spreading from this region towards the north-east, east,&nbsp;and
                south-east, they have colonized north-east Russia, the&nbsp;Ural region, Caucasus,
                Siberia, and large parts of the&nbsp;Kirghiz Steppe,—the leading feature of their
                colonization&nbsp;having always been penetration in compact masses among&nbsp;the
                original inhabitants. Thus, on northern Caucasus&nbsp;the Russians (chiefly Little
                Russians) already constitute a&nbsp;compact rural population of nearly 1,500,000,
                that is,&nbsp;about a quarter of the total population of Caucasia. In&nbsp;Western
                Siberia the Great Russians already number&nbsp;more than 2,300,000 agriculturists,
                constituting four-fifths of the entire population ; in Eastern Siberia
                they&nbsp;number more than 1,000,000, that is, probably more than&nbsp;the original
                inhabitants ; and the Kirghiz Steppe has also&nbsp;begun rapidly to be colonized
                within the last twenty years.&nbsp;It is only in the more densely peopled Turkestan,
                and in&nbsp;the recently annexed Transcaspian region, that Russian&nbsp;settlers
                continue to bear but a small proportion to the&nbsp;natives (who are more than
                4,600,000 strong). The&nbsp;Slavonians altogether number more than 75,000,000,
                of&nbsp;which number 5,600,000 are Poles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Swedes (310,000), Germans (1,240,000), Roumanians, Serbs, &lt;kc.,
                may number altogether about 2,500,000.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great variety of populations belonging to
                the&nbsp;Caucasian race, but not yet well classified, some of which&nbsp;are
                considered to be remainders of formerly larger nationalities pushed aside into the
                mountain tracts during their&nbsp;migrations, are met with on Caucasus. Such are
                the&nbsp;Georgians, Ossetes, Lesghians, who fall little short of&nbsp;2,500,000, and
                the Armenians, about 1,000,000.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iranian branch is represented by some
                130,000&nbsp;Persians and Kurds in Caucasia and Transcaucasia, and by&nbsp;Tajiks in
                Turkestan, mixed with Turco-Tartar Sarts. The&nbsp;nomad Tsigans, or Gipsies,
                numbering nearly 12,000, may&nbsp;be mentioned under this head.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Semitic branch consists of upwards of
                3,000,000&nbsp;Jews in Poland, in west and south-west Russia, and on&nbsp;Caucasus
                and in the towns of Central Asia, and of a few&nbsp;thousand Karaite
            Jews.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ural-Altaic branch comprises two great
                subdivisions—the Finnish and the Turco-Tartarian stems,&nbsp;mixed to some extent
                with Mongolians. The former (see&nbsp;below) occupy, broadly speaking, a wide
                stretch of territory&nbsp;to the north of the Slavonians, from the Baltic to
                the&nbsp;Yenisei, and include the Baltic Finns, the Northern Finns,&nbsp;the Volga
                Finns, and the Ugrians. The Russians have&nbsp;already spread among the last two in
                compact masses,</span></p>
