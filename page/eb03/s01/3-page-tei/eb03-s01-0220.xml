On the 16th of June, the royal bride ſet out from Richmond in Surry, in company with her father, who gave her the convoy as far as Colleweſton, the residence of his mother the counteſs of Richmond. After paſſing ſome days there, the king reſigned his daughter to the care of the earls of Surry and Northumberland, who proceeded with her to the borders of Scotland. Here a number of the company were permitted to take their leave; but thoſe who remained ſtill made a royal appearance. At Lamberton church they were met by James, attended by a numerous train of his nobility and officers of ſtate. From Lamberton they proceeded to Dalkeith, and next day to Edinburgh; where the nuptials were celebrated with the greateſt ſplendor. On this occaſion, it is ſaid that the Scots ſurpaſſed all their gueſts in extravagance and luxury: which muſt have been owing to the great intercourſe and commerce which James and his ſubjects maintained with foreign courts and countries.</p><p>After the celebration of the nuptials, James appears to have enjoyed a tranquillity unknown almoſt to any of his predeceſſors; and began to make a conſiderable figure among the European potentates. But the magnificence of his court and embaſſies, his liberality to ſtrangers and to learned men, his coſtly edifices, and, above all, the large ſums he laid out in ſhip building, had now brought him into ſome difficulties; and he ſo far attended to the advice and example of his father-in- law, that he ſupplied his neceſſities by reviving dormant penal laws, particularly with regard to wardſhips and old titles of eſtates, by which he raiſed large ſums. Though he did this without aſſembling his parliament,</p><p>yet he found agents who juſtified thoſe proceedings, in the ſame manner as Epſon and Dudley did thoſe of Henry, under the fonction of law. At laſt, however, touched with the ſufferings of his ſubjects, he ordered all proſecutions to be ſtopped. He even went farther: for, ſenſible of the deteſtation into which his father- in-law’s avarice had brought himſelf and his adminiſtration, he ordered the miniſters who had adviſed him to thoſe ſhameful courſes to be impriſoned; and ſome of them, who probably had exceeded their commiſſion, actually died in their confinement.</p><p>About this time, James applied himſelf, with incredible aſſiduity, to the budding of ſhips; one of which, the St Michael, is ſuppoſed to have been the largeſt then in the world @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(m).</hi> He worked with his own hands in building it; and it is plain, from his conduct, that he was aſpiring to be a maritime power, in which he was encouraged by the excellent ſeamen which Scotland then produced. The firſt eſſay of his arms by ſea was in favour of his kinſman John king of Denmark. This prince was brother to Margaret queen of Scotland; and had partly been called to the throne of Sweden, and partly poſſeſſed it by force. He was oppoſed by the adminiſtrator, Sture, whom he pardoned after he was crowned. Sture, however, renewing his rebellion, and the Norwegians revolting at the ſome time, John found himſelf under ſuch difficulties, that he was forced to return to Denmark; but he left his queen in poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Stockholm, which ſhe bravely defended againſt Sture and the Swedes. This heroic princeſs became a great favourite with James; and ſeveral letters that paſſed between them are ſtill extant. The king of Denmark, next to the French monarch, was the favourite ally of James; who, early in his reign, had compromiſed ſome differences between them. It likewiſe appears, from the hiſtories of the north, that both James and his father had given great affiſtance to his Daniſh majeſty in reducing the Norwegians; and he reſolved to become a party in the war againſt the Swedes, and the Lubeckers who aſſiſted them, if the</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(μ</hi>) Of this ſhip we have the following account by Lindſay of Pitſcottie. “In the ſame year, the king of Scotland bigged a great ſhip, called the <hi rend="italic">Great Michael,</hi> which was the greateſt ſhip, and of moſt ſtrength, that ever ſailed in England or France. For this ſhip was of ſo great ſtature, and took ſo much timber, that, except Falkland, ſhe wafted all the woods in Fife, which was oak-wood, by all timber that was gotten out of Norway; for ſhe was ſo ſtrong, and of ſo great length and breadth (all the wrights of Scotland, yea, and many other ſtrangers, were at her device, by the king’s commandment, who wrought very buſily in her; but it was a year and day ere ſhe was complete); to wit, ſhe was twelve ſcore foot of length, and thirty-ſix foot within the ſides. She was ten foot thick in the wall, outted jeſts of oak in her wall, and boards on every ſide, ſo ſtark and ſo thick, that no cannon could go through her. This great ſhip cumbered Scotland to get her to the ſea. From that time that ſhe was afloat, and her maſts and foils complete, with tows and anchors effeiring thereto, ſhe was counted to the king to be thirty thouſand pounds of expences, by her artillery, which was very great and coſtly to the king, by all the reft of her orders; to wit, ſhe bare many cannons, ſix on every ſide, with three great baſſils, two behind in her dock, and one before, with three hundred ſhot of ſmall artillery, that is to ſay, myand and battret-falcon, and quarter-falcon, ſlings, peſtelent ſerpetens, and double-dogs, with hagtor and culvering, cors-bows and hand-bows. She had three hundred mariners to ſail her; ſhe had ſix ſcore of gunners to uſe her artillery; and had a thouſand men of war, by her captain, ſhippers, and quarter-maſters.</p><p>“When this ſhip paſt to the ſea, and was lying in the road, the king gart ſhoot a cannon at her, to eſſay her if ſhe was wight; but I heard ſay, it deared her not, and did her little ſkaith. And if any man believe that this deſcription of the ſhip be not of verity, as we have written, let him paſs to the gate of Tillibardin, and there, afore the ſame, ye will fee the length and breadth of her, planted with hawthorn, by the wright that helped to make her. As for other properties of her, Sir Andrew Wood is my author, who was quarter-maſter of her; and Robert Bartyne, who was maſter-ſhipper."</p></body></text></TEI>
