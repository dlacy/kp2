<p><label>REPTILES</label>
, in natural hiſtory, a kind of animals denominated from their creeping or advancing on the belly. Ογ reptiles are a genus of animals and infects, which, inſtead of feet, reſt on one part of the body, while they advance forward with the reſt. Such aie earthworms, ſnakes, caterpillars, &amp;c. Indeed, moſt of the claſs of reptiles have feet ; only thoſe very ſmall, and the legs remarkably ſhort in , proportion to the bulk of the body.</p><p>Natuiahſts obierve a world of artful contrivance for the motion of reptiles. Thus, particularly in the earth, woιm, Dr W ιllιs tells us, the whole body is only a chain of annular muſcles ; or, as Dr Derham ſays, it is only one continued ſpiral muſcle, the orbicular fibres where-ot being contracted, render each ring narrower and longer than before ; by which means it is enabled, like the worm of an augre, to bore its paffage into the earth. Its reptile motion might alſo be explained by a wire wound on a cylinder, which when Hipped off, and one end extended and held faſt, will bring the other near to it. So the earthworm having ſhot out or extended his body (which is with a wreathing), it takes hold by thele ſmall feet it hath, and ſo con-tιaCtS the hinder part of its body. Dr Tyſon adds, that when the forepart of the body is itretched out, and applied to a plane at a diſtance, the hind part relaxing and ſhortening is eafily drawn towards it as a centre.</p><p>Its feet are difpofed in a quadruple row the whole length of the worm, with which, as with ſo many hooks, it ſaſtens down fometimes this and ſometimes that part of the body to the plane, and at the ſame time ſtretch-es out or drags after it another.</p><p>The creeping of ſerpents is effected after a fomewhat different manner ; there being a difference in their ſtructure, in that theſe laſt have a campages of bones •articulated together.</p><p>I he body here is not drawn together, but as it were complicated ; part of it being applied on the rough ground, and the reſt ejaculated and ſhot from it, which being.ſet on the ground in its turn, brings the other after it. I he ſpine of the back variouſly wreathed has the. ſame effect in leaping, as the joints in the feet of other animals they make their leaps by means of muſcles, and extend the plicae or folds.
