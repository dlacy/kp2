So that the Syrian ambaſſadors now prepared to ſet out for Rome, to get the conditions of peace propoſed by Scipio ratified there. In the mean time, the conſul dividing his army into three bodies, put it into winter-quarters ; one part continued at Magneſia, another was ſent to Trallis, and the third to Epheſus, where the Scipios took up their quarters. There they received a new embaſſy from Antiochus, with the hoſtages he had promiſed, the Roman priſoners and deſerters, and the ſtrangers which the conſul had demanded, except Hannibal, who after the king’s defeat had fled out of his dominions ; and Thoas the Ætolian, who, as ſoon as he heard that a treaty was on foot between Antiochus and the Romans, had returned to Ætolia, where a war was likely to break out between that republic and Rome. L. Aurelius Cotta was ſent with the ambaſſadors to Rome, to acquaint the ſenate with the particulars of the treaty. When they appeared before the conſcript fathers, they ſpoke with great ſubmiſſion, and only deſired them to ratify the articles which the Scipios had offered to their maſter. The ſenate, after examining them, ordered that a treaty of peace ſhould be concluded with Antiochus, and the articles of it engraved on braſs, and fixed up in the Capitol. They only added one clauſe, which was, That the Syrians ſhould change every year all their hoſtages, except the ſon of king Antiochus, who ſhould continue at Rome as long as the republic thought fit. The peace being thus ratified, and all Aſia on this ſide Mount Taurus delivered into the hands of the Romans, the Greek cities were by them reſtored to their liberty, the provinces of Caria and Lydia given to the Rhodians, and all the reſt that had belonged to Antiochus beſtowed upon Eumenes.</p><p>Antiochus did not long ſurvive his misfortune at Magneſia. Some tell us, that being greatly puzzled how to raiſe the ſum he had engaged to pay to the Romans, he ſeized on the riches which had for many ages been depoſited in a temple of Jupiter Belus in the province of Elymais ; upon which the populace roſe in arms, and slew him and all his attendants. Others inform us, that he was killed at an entertainment by one of his gueſts.</p><p>Antiochus the Great died in 187, and with him the glory of the Syrian empire. The Romans now gave laws to the kings of Syria, inſomuch, that when Antiochus Epiphanes the grandſon of Antiochus the Great hesitated at obeying the commands of the ſenate, one of the ambaſſadors drew a circle round him with a rod on the floor, and told him that he ſhould not go out of that ſpot before he had told him what he was to do. The moſt remarkable tranſactions of this prince are his wars with the Jews, and perſecutions of them ; of which a full account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Jews.</hi> After a variety of uſurpers and tyrants, the kingdom of Syria fell under Tigranes king of Armenia in the year 83 B. C. ; and upon his overthrow by the Romans, it became a province of the dominions of the republic. From them it was taken by the Saracens in the reign of the caliph Omar, and is now a province of Turkey in Aſia.</p><p>Syria is in ſome meaſure only a chain of mountains, varying in their levels, ſituation, and appearances. The part of the country, however, next the ſea is in general low, and beſides this there are ſeveral extenſive valleys. The climate on the ſea-coaſt and in theſe valleys is very hot, but in the higher parts of the country it bears a good deal of resemblance to that of France. Syria is exceedingly fertile, and the variety of its productions is very great. Beſides wheat, rye, barley, beans, and the cotton plant, which is cultivated everywhere, Paleſtine abounds in ſeſamum, from which oil is procured, and doura as good as that of Egypt. Maize thrives in the light ſoil of Balbec, and even rice is cultivated with ſucceſs on the borders of the marſhy country of Havula. They have lately begun to plant ſugarcanes in the gardens of Saide and of Bairout, and they find them equal to thoſe of the Delta. Indigo grows without cultivating on the banks of the Jordan, in the country of Biſan, and only requires care to make it of an excellent quality. The hill-ſides of Latakia produce tobacco. Gaza produces dates like Mecca, and pomegranates like Algiers ;@@ Tripoli affords oranges equal to thoſe of Malta ; Bairout figs like thoſe of Marſeilles, and bananas not inferior to thoſe of St Domingo ; Aleppo enjoys the excluſive advantage of producing piſtachios ; and Damaſcus juſtly boaſts of poſſeſſing all the fruits known in our provinces. Its ſtony ſoil ſuits equally the apples of Normandy, the plums of Touraine, and the peaches of Paris. Twenty sorts of apricots are reckoned there, the ſtone of one of which contains a kernel highly valued through all Turkey. The cochineal plant, which grows on all that coaſt, contains perhaps that precious inſect in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St Domingo.</p><p>The inhabitants may be divided into three principal clasſes : the deſcendants of the Greeks of the Lower Empire ; the Arabs, their conquerors; and the Turks, the preſent ruling power: and theſe again, the first into three, the ſecond into four, classes ; beſides three wandering tribes of Turkomen, Curds, and Bedouin Arabs. The ancient inhabitants before the Greeks under Alexander are entirely loſt. The inhabitants are in general of a middling ſtature, and the eyes of the women almoſt everywhere beautiful, and their ſhape correct and well proportioned. The general language is Arabic. Syriac is a dead language.</p><p>SYRINGA, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lilac,</hi> in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">diandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">monogynia ; </hi>and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 44th order, <hi rend="italic">Septaria.</hi> The corolla is quadrifid, and the capſule is bilocular. There are three ſpecies, the vulgaris, persica, and ſuſpenſa.
