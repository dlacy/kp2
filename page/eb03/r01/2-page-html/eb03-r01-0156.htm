<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Restauration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In England, the return of king Charles II. in 1660, is, by way of eminence, called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Reβoration ;</span><span class="font3"> and the&nbsp;29th of May is kept as an anniverſary feſtival, in com-memoration of that event, by which the regal and epiſ-∙copal government was reſtpred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESTORATIVE, in medicine, a remedy proper for reftoring and retrieving the ſtrength and vigour&nbsp;both of the body and animal ſpirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All under this claſs, fays Quincy, are rather nutri-mental than medicinal ; and are more adminiſtered to repair the waſtes of the conſtitution, than to alter and&nbsp;rectify its diſorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESTRICTION, among logicians, is limiting a term, ſo as to make it ſignify leſs than it uſually does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESTRINGENT, in medicine,' the ſame with aſtringent. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Astringents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESULT, what iβ gathered from a conference, inquiry, meditation, or the like ; or the conclufion and effect thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESURRECTION, in theology, is a rifiιιg again ſrom the ftate of the dead and is that event, the be-lief of which conſtitutee one of the principal articles in&nbsp;the Chrittian creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In treating of this object of our faith, it has been uſual to mention, ſirſt, the reſurrection of our Bleffed&nbsp;X„ord, with the character of the witneffes, and the authenticity of the goſpel hiſtory by which it has been&nbsp;proved, and from which, as a conſequence, ours is inferred. But as moſt of the arguments for his reſurrec-tion are contained in the goſpels, and as merely to re-peat them would afford, we hope, but little informa-tion to moſt of our readers, we mean here to take a&nbsp;view of the ſeveral grounds on which the belief of a&nbsp;future exiſtence is ſuppoſed to be founded ; to collect&nbsp;together ſome of the ſentiments of authors and nations&nbsp;concerning the place where departed fpirits reſide ; concerning the nature of their preſent ſtate ; concerning&nbsp;the kinds of their future deſtination ; that we may afterwards ſee how far their notions differ and agree&nbsp;with what we conſider as the doctrines of Scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cf a future ſtate, there have ſometimes been found a few wandering and obſcure tribes who ſeemed to enter-tain no notion at all ; though it ſhould be remarked, that&nbsp;ſome oſ theſe were likewiſe obſerved in ſo low a degree&nbsp;oſ ſavage barbarity as not to be acquainted with the&nbsp;uſe oſ the bow, the dart, or the ſling, and as not&nbsp;knowing how to wield a club, or to throw a ſtone, as a&nbsp;weapon of defence *.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">wherever the human mind has been cultivated, or properly ſpeaking, begun to be cultivated, the opinion&nbsp;has likewiſe generally prevailed that human exiſtence is&nbsp;not confined to the preſent ſcene ; nay, ſo very gene-ral has this notion been found among mankind, that&nbsp;many are puzzled how to account for what they ſuppoſe&nbsp;to be almoſt next to its univerſality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To explain the phenomenon, ſome have imagined that it is a notion derived by tradition from primeval re-velation. They ſuppofe that the firſt parent of mankind, as a moral agent accountable for his conduct, was&nbsp;informed by his Maker of every thing which it was of&nbsp;importance for him to know ; that he muſt have been&nbsp;acquainted with this doctrine of a future ſtate in parti-cular j and that he could hardly fail to communicate a&nbsp;matter fo intereſting to his poſterity. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font3">ſuppoſ¢,&nbsp;too, that the hiſtory of the tranflatioa of Enoch muſt&nbsp;have made a great noife in the world, and that the re-membrance of it muſt have been long retained and&nbsp;widely diſſuſed ; and they find in the book of Job plain&nbsp;intimations of a reſurrection from the dead, which, from&nbsp;the manner in which they are introduced, they think&nbsp;that very ancient patriarch muſt have received through&nbsp;this channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not thought to be any objection to theſe fuppo∙ ſitions, that the Moſt High, when delivering his laws&nbsp;from the top of Mount Sinai, did not enforce them by&nbsp;the awful fonctions of a future ſtate. The intelligent&nbsp;reader of the Scriptures knows that the fonctions of a&nbsp;future ſtate belong to a different and more univerſal diſ-penſation than was that of Moſes ; that the primeval&nbsp;revelation related to that diſpenfotion ; and that the&nbsp;Jewiſh law, with its temporal fonctions, was introduced&nbsp;only to preſerve the knowledge and worſh¾p of the true&nbsp;God among a people too groſs in their conceptions to&nbsp;have been properly influenced by the view of future rewards and puniſhments, of fuch a nature as eye hath&nbsp;not feen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into&nbsp;the heart of man to conceive. He fees at the ſame time,&nbsp;everywhere ſcattered through the old Teſtament, plain&nbsp;indications of the Moſaic economy, being no more than&nbsp;preparatory to the bringing in of a better hope ; and&nbsp;he thinks it evident, that ſuch Jews as underſtood any&nbsp;thing of the nature of that better hope, muſt have been&nbsp;convinced, that, however the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ceremonial rites</span><span class="font3"> of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">their&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">religion might be ſuſſiciently guarded by temporal ſanc-tions, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fundamental principles</span><span class="font3"> of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> religion and virtue&nbsp;are ſupported by rewards and puniſhments to be diſpen-ſed in a ſtate beyond the grave. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prophecy</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the progenitors of the human race muſt have been inſpired by their Creator with the knowledge of&nbsp;their immortality, and of every thing neceſſary to their&nbsp;everlaſting welfare, cannot, we ſhould think, be queſ-tioned by any one who believes that the world had a&nbsp;beginning, and that it is under the government of good-neſs and juſtice. The progreſs from ſenfe to ſcience is&nbsp;ſo flow, that however capable we may ſuppoſe the ear-lieſt inhabitants of this earth to have been of making&nbsp;philofophical difeoveries, we cannot believe that the Father of mercies left his helpleſs creature to difeover for&nbsp;himſelf his future exiſtence. Death, when firſt preſented to him, muſt have been a ghaſtly object ; and&nbsp;had he been left without any hope of redemption from it,&nbsp;he would undoubtedly have funk into liſtleſsdeſpondency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But a proſpect of immortality is ſo pleafing to the human mind, that if it was communicated to the firſt</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">man, it would of courſe be cheriſhed by his poſterk ty ; and there is no difficulty in conceiving how it&nbsp;might be handed down by tradition to very remote ages,&nbsp;among ſuch of his defeendents as were not ſcattered&nbsp;over the face of the earth in ſmall and ſavage tribes.—&gt;&nbsp;In the courfe of its progreſs, it would frequently be&nbsp;new-modelled by the ever active imagination ; and at&nbsp;laſt many abſurd and fantaſtic circumſtances would&nbsp;doubtlefs be combined with the original truth, that&nbsp;death puts not an end to human exiſtence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But though we are firmly convinced that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">flrſt </span><span class="font3">principles of ufeful knowledge, and among them the&nbsp;doctrine of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">future ſtate, were communicated to man</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
