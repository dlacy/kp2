<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of eminence visited France. Among these Del Rosso, Primaticcio, Del Sarto, and Da Vinci are the most famous.&nbsp;But their example was not productive of a really great&nbsp;school of French painting. It was left for the Poussins&nbsp;and Claude Lorraine in the next century, acting under&nbsp;mingled Italian and Flemish influences, to embody the&nbsp;still active spirit of the classical revival. These three&nbsp;masters were the contemporaries of Corneille, and do not&nbsp;belong to the Renaissance period. Sculpture, on the&nbsp;contrary, in which art, as in architecture, the mediaeval&nbsp;French had been surpassed by no other people of Europe,&nbsp;was practised with originality and power in the reigns of&nbsp;Henry II. and Francis I. Ponzio and Cellini, who quitted&nbsp;Italy for France, found themselves outrivailed in their own&nbsp;sphere by Jean Goujon, Cousin, and Pilon. The decorative&nbsp;sculpture of this epoch, whether combined with architecture or isolated in monumental statuary, ranks for grace&nbsp;and suavity with the best of Sansovino’s. At the same&nbsp;time it is unmistakably inspired by a sense of beauty different from the Italian,—more piquant and pointed, less&nbsp;languorous, more mannered perhaps, but with less of&nbsp;empty rhythmical effect. All this while, the minor arts&nbsp;of enamelling, miniature, glass-painting, goldsmith’s work,&nbsp;jewellery, engraving, tapestry, wood-carving, pottery, &amp;c.,&nbsp;were cultivated with a spontaneity and freedom which&nbsp;proved that France, in the middle point between Flanders&nbsp;and Italy, was able to use both influences without a&nbsp;sacrifice of native taste. It may indeed be said in general&nbsp;that what is true of France is likewise true of all countries&nbsp;which felt the artistic impulses of the Renaissance.&nbsp;Whether we regard Spain, the Netherlands, or Germany at&nbsp;this epoch, we find a national impress stamped upon the&nbsp;products of the plastic and the decorative arts, notwithstanding the prevalence of certain forms derived from the&nbsp;antique and Italy. It was only at a later period that the&nbsp;formalism of pseudo-classic pedantry reduced natural and&nbsp;national originality to a dead unanimity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">French literature was quick to respond to Renaissance influences. De Comines, the historian of Charles VIII.’s&nbsp;expedition to Naples, differs from the earlier French&nbsp;chroniclers in his way of regarding the world of men and&nbsp;affairs. He has the perspicuity and analytical penetration&nbsp;of a Venetian ambassador. Villon, his contemporary, may&nbsp;rather be ranked, so far as artistic form and use of&nbsp;knowledge are concerned, with poets of the Middle Ages,&nbsp;and in particular with the Goliardi. But he is essentially&nbsp;modern in the vividness of his self-portraiture, and in&nbsp;what we are wont to call realism. Both De Comines and&nbsp;Villon indicate the entrance of a new quality into literature. The Rhétoriqueurs, while protracting mediæval&nbsp;traditions by their use of allegory and complicated metrical&nbsp;systems, sought to improve the French language by&nbsp;introducing Latinisms. Thus the Revival of Learning&nbsp;began to affect the vernacular in the last years of the 15tlx&nbsp;century.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marot and his school reacted against this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">pedantry. The Renaissance displayed itself in their effort to purify the form and diction of poetry. But the decisive&nbsp;revolution was effected by Ronsard and his comrades of&nbsp;the Pléiade. It was their professed object to raise French&nbsp;to a level with the classics, and to acclimatize Italian&nbsp;species of verse. The humanistic movement led these&nbsp;learned writers to engraft the graces of the antique upon&nbsp;their native literature, and to refine it by emulating the&nbsp;lucidity of Petrarch. The result of their endeavour was&nbsp;immediately apparent in the new force added to French&nbsp;rhythm, the new pomp, richness, colouring, and polish conferred upon poetic diction. French style gradually attained&nbsp;to fixity, and the alexandrine came to be recognized as&nbsp;the standard line in poetry. D’Aubigné’s invective and&nbsp;Regnier’s satire, at the close of the 16th century, are as</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">modern as Voltaire’s. Meanwhile the drama was emerging from the mediæval mysteries; and the classical type, made&nbsp;popular by Garnier’s genius, was elaborated, as in Italy,&nbsp;upon the model of Seneca and the canons of the three unities.&nbsp;The tradition thus formed was continued and fortified by the&nbsp;illustrious playwrights of the 17th century. Translation&nbsp;from Greek and Latin into French progressed rapidly at&nbsp;the commencement of this period. It was a marked&nbsp;characteristic of the Renaissance in France to appropriate&nbsp;the spoils of Greece and Rome for the profit of the mother&nbsp;tongue. Amyot’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plutarch</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daphnis and Chloe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">rank among the most exquisite examples of beautiful&nbsp;French prose. Prose had now the charm of simplicity&nbsp;combined with grace. To mention Brantôme is to&nbsp;mention the most entertaining of gossips. To speak of&nbsp;Montaigne is to speak of the best as well as the first&nbsp;of essayists. In all the literary work which has been&nbsp;mentioned, the originality and freshness of the French&nbsp;genius are no less conspicuous than its saturation with the&nbsp;new learning and with Italian studies. But the greatest&nbsp;name of the epoch, the name which is synonymous with the&nbsp;Renaissance in France, has yet to be uttered. That, of&nbsp;course, is Rabelais. His incommensurable and indescribable masterpiece of mingled humour, wisdom, satire, erudition, indecency, profundity, levity, imagination, realism,&nbsp;reflects the whole age in its mirror of hyper-Aristophanic&nbsp;farce. What Ariosto is for Italy, Cervantes for Spain,&nbsp;Erasmus for Holland, Luther for Germany, Shakespeare for&nbsp;England, that is Rabelais for France. The Renaissance&nbsp;cannot be comprehended in its true character without&nbsp;familiarity with these six representatives of its manifold&nbsp;and many-sided inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The French Renaissance, so rich on the side of arts and letters, was hardly less rich on the side of classical studies.&nbsp;The revival of learning has a noble muster-roll of names&nbsp;in France: Turnèbe, the patriarch of Hellenistic studies;&nbsp;the Etiennes of Paris, equalling in numbers, industry, and&nbsp;learning their Venetian rivals; the two Scaligers ; impassioned Dolet ; eloquent Muret ; learned Cujas ; terrible&nbsp;Calvin ; Ramus, the intrepid antagonist of Aristotle ; De&nbsp;Thou and De Bèze ; ponderous Casaubon ; brilliant&nbsp;young Saumaise. The distinguishing characteristics of&nbsp;French humanism are vivid intelligence, critical audacity&nbsp;and polemical acumen, perspicuity of exposition, learning&nbsp;directed in its applications by logical sense rather than by&nbsp;artistic ideals of taste. Some of the names just mentioned&nbsp;remind us that in France, as in Germany and Holland,&nbsp;the Reformation was closely connected with the revival of&nbsp;learning. Humanism has never been in the narrow sense&nbsp;of that term Protestant ; still less has it been strictly&nbsp;Catholic. In Italy it fostered a temper of mind decidedly&nbsp;averse to theological speculation and religious earnestness.&nbsp;In Holland and Germany, with Erasmus, Reuchlin, and&nbsp;Melanchthon, it developed types of character, urbane,&nbsp;reflective, pointedly or gently critical, which, left to&nbsp;themselves, would not have plunged the north of Europe&nbsp;into the whirlpool of belligerent reform. Yet none the&nbsp;less was the new learning, through the open spirit of&nbsp;inquiry it nourished, its vindication of the private reason,&nbsp;its enthusiasm for republican antiquity, and its proud&nbsp;assertion of the rights of human independence, linked by&nbsp;a strong and subtle chain to that turbid revolt of the&nbsp;individual consciousness against spiritual despotism draped&nbsp;in fallacies and throned upon abuses. To this rebellion&nbsp;we give the name of Reformation. But, while the&nbsp;necessities of antagonism to papal Rome made it assume&nbsp;at first the form of narrow and sectarian opposition, it&nbsp;marked in fact a vital struggle of the intellect towards&nbsp;truth and freedom, involving future results of scepticism&nbsp;and rationalistic audacity from which its earlier champions</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
