                towards the Capitol, from which access is&nbsp;given to the curved platform and so
                on to the floor of the rostra.&nbsp;The bronze rostra on this structure of 44 B.c.

                too much for the travertine piers, which are not set on&nbsp;their natural beds but
                endways, and therefore are very weak, the&nbsp;structure seems to have given way at
                more than one time and the&nbsp;floor has been supported by piers and arches of
                brick-faced concrete,&nbsp;inserted either in place of or at the sides of the
                shattered piers.&nbsp;These later additions, apparently of the 3d and 4th centuries,
                are&nbsp;omitted in Plate VΠ. for the sake of clearness. Tlie moulded plinth&nbsp;of

                incised with masons’ marks, namely, the Greek letters&nbsp;Γ, Δ, E, Z, H, Θ, and K.
                A number of metal pins on the face of&nbsp;the slabs of porta sauta marble which
                line its front show that&nbsp;emblemata or reliefs, probably of gilt bronze, were
                once fastened&nbsp;to the marble.@@<sup>2</sup> The use of Greek marble shows that
                this platform&nbsp;can be but little earlier than the rostra (44 B.c.) ; and it
                appears&nbsp;possible that this is the Græcostasis, transferred, like the rostra,

                Starting from the Forum, it passed between the&nbsp;temple of Saturn and the
                Basilica Julia, then close under the cliff&nbsp;of the Capitolium (see Liv., xxxv.
                21) and on to the Porta Cannen-talis. It was spanned at its commencement by a
                brick-faced arch&nbsp;lined with marble, the lower part of which exists, and is not
                earlier&nbsp;than the 3d or 4th century.@@<sup>10</sup> At this end of the Forum the
                arch&nbsp;of Tiberius was built across the Sacra Via, which is narrowed as
                if&nbsp;to bring it under the span of the arch. It was erected in 17 a.d.&nbsp;to
