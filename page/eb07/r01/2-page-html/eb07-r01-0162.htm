        <p><span class="font0">shell,—and our practical experience, even of green fat, is far from
                extensive ;—but we have watched a siren from the&nbsp;, far west ; and as the
                history of the species in question cannot&nbsp;fail to throw light on the nature and
                attributes of others to&nbsp;which it is related, and as it is in itself a very
                extraordinary&nbsp;and interesting reptile, we shall make no apology for
                the&nbsp;length of the following observations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Gardenian siren </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">(Siren lacertina,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.), so
                named in remembrance of Dr Garden, by whom it seems to have been&nbsp;first
                observed, in its general form and aspect bears a great&nbsp;resemblance to an eel,
                but is at once to be distinguished&nbsp;from a fish by its anterior arms. The fine
                specimen long&nbsp;preserved alive by Dr Patrick Neill of Edinburgh was originally
                transmitted by Dr Farmer of Charlestown, South&nbsp;Carolina, to Dr Monro. It
                measured one foot five inches in&nbsp;length, and about four inches in
                circumference. (See Plate&nbsp;CCCCXXXIV. fig. 3.) Its colour was deep blackish
                brown,&nbsp;rather paler beneath, where it was partially tinged w ith a bluish hue,
                and marked all over with numerous small, irregular, pale, ashy-brown spots, not very
                perceptible except on a&nbsp;rather close inspection. The muzzle was blunt,
                depressed,&nbsp;sub-rounded or slightly square, and considerably narrower&nbsp;than
                the hinder portion of the head. The nostrils, which&nbsp;are inconspicuous, are
                placed near the anterior angle of the&nbsp;upper jaw. The head is broad and flat.
                The eyes are dim,&nbsp;of an obscure blue, and there is no very obvious
                distinction&nbsp;of colour between the iris and pupil, both appearing as
                if&nbsp;seen through a semi-transparent membrane. The gills consist of three fleshy
                peduncles, which increase in size from&nbsp;the first to the last. They are
                beautifully branched from&nbsp;beneath and along their lateral and terminal edges,
                and&nbsp;these little branches are divided and subdivided into still&nbsp;more
                minute ramifications. This elegant fringe-work forms&nbsp;the true gills, the
                central and fleshy stalks serving merely&nbsp;as their support. Beneath, and rather
                in advance of these&nbsp;bodies, are three vertical clefts, through which the water
                is&nbsp;ejected backwards from the interior of the mouth upon the&nbsp;gills, though
                with a much more languid and less perceptible&nbsp;action than in fishes. These
                clefts or branchial perforations are sustained and kept in separation by four
                arches,&nbsp;which Garden, Ellis, and Camper appear to have mistaken&nbsp;for gills,
                although both Linnæus and John Hunter took a&nbsp;more accurate view of the matter.

        <p><span class="font0">The general surface of this siren is very smooth and shining ; and if
                there are any scales, as some have said, they&nbsp;are not apparent to the naked
                eye. Towards the tail its&nbsp;form becomes thin and compressed, and that part is
                margined for several inches both above and below, as well as&nbsp;around its
                terminal point, by a narrow membrane or fin,&nbsp;which no doubt greatly aids its
                movements through the water.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The earliest notice of this singular reptile appears to have been
                communicated by Dr Garden to Linnæus through the&nbsp;medium of Mr Ellis in the year
                1765. He described the&nbsp;simultaneous existence of lungs and gills, and
                concluded&nbsp;that it was a perfect animal, chiefly because there did
                not&nbsp;exist in Carolina any species of salamander, or other aquatic creature, of
                equal size, of which it could be regarded as&nbsp;the larva. It was in consequence
                of the information received regarding this species that Linnæus, though
                with&nbsp;hesitation, founded his order of </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Amphibia meantes,</span><span class="font0"> of
                which&nbsp;the most peculiar character consisted in there being “ bran-clliæ et
                pulmones simul.” The great Swedish naturalist&nbsp;appears to have been particularly
                interested by the peculiarities of the siren ; for in his reply to Mr Ellis,
                acknowledging receipt of Dr Garden’s “ very rare two-footed animal with gills and
                lungs,” he observes that nothing had ever&nbsp;exercised his thoughts so much, nor
                was there anything he&nbsp;so greatly desired to know, as the real nature of so
                extraordinary a creature.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Although Ellis and Hunter wisely regarded the siren as a perfect
                animal, the propriety of this opinion was by no&nbsp;means universally admitted.
                Pallas, not perceiving that&nbsp;such metamorphoses as he supposed were rendered
                impossible by the absence of any germ of the hinder extremities,&nbsp;even in the
                skeleton, still insisted that the siren was nothing&nbsp;more than the larva of a
                four-footed salamander.@@<sup>2</sup> A similar opinion was maintained by
                    Hermann,@@<sup>3</sup> Lacepede,@@<sup>4</sup> and&nbsp;Schneider.@@<sup>5</sup>
                About twenty years after the original discovery of the animal, Camper (in 1785)
                examined a specimen&nbsp;in the British Museum, the condition of which was so
                bad&nbsp;that he was unable to detect the lungs ; whereupon he took&nbsp;up and
                promulgated an entirely new view, according to&nbsp;which, without reference to the
                existence of feet, he declared that the siren was a </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">flsh.</span><span class="font0"> Gmelin, of course,
                immediately classed it with the eels, and it thus became the Jfu-</span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raenα siren</span><span class="font0"> of
                his edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Systema
                Naturœ!</span><span class="font0"> Whatever may be thought of Dr Garden’s skill as
                an anatomist,&nbsp;Camper’s conclusion was certainly somewhat precipitate,
                in&nbsp;the face of so great an authority as that of John Hunter.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the year 1800, Baron Cuvier received a young siren from M. de
                Beauvois. The great French anatomist, whose&nbsp;splendid labours have thrown such a
                flood of light on so&nbsp;many obscure subjects of zoological science, was not
                likely&nbsp;to lose the opportunity of settling this still disputed point.&nbsp;In
                his first observations,@@<sup>6</sup> and in an after and more
                    ample&nbsp;memoir,@@<sup>7</sup> he has, we think, successfully shown that both
                the&nbsp;proteus and siren are perfect, that is, completed animals,&nbsp;belonging
                to different genera of Batrachian reptiles, but&nbsp;quite distinct from either
                lizards or salamanders in any of&nbsp;their progressive stages. Yet the opposite
                opinion (so tenacious is error) does not continue without adherents. In&nbsp;an
                elaborate essay by two Italian authors, Sig. Configliachi&nbsp;and Rusconi, in which
                the siren is incidentally mentioned,&nbsp;these naturalists infer from analogy, that
                as the canal of the&nbsp;nostrils is not so perforated as to open into the interior
                of&nbsp;the mouth, so it must be incapable of respiring atmospheric&nbsp;air, and
                would speedily die if removed from its liquid element.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Now, the value of the living siren observed by Dr Neill for six or
                seven successive seasons, consisted in this,—that&nbsp;it demonstrated </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de facto,</span><span class="font0"> what
                had been previously a matter of mere logical inference on the part of the
                anatomist.&nbsp;During the long period of its confinement no change whatever took
                place, either in its general aspect, or in the form&nbsp;or structure of the feet
                and gills. Had it been a larva, it&nbsp;would assuredly have lost these last-named
                organs during&nbsp;the time of observation. But the most curious result regarding
                this specimen was obtained accidentally, and happily illustrates the very point on
                which it was most desirable&nbsp;to obtain information. It is thus related by Dr
                Neill : “ Although I certainly would not have made the experiment of&nbsp;the
                fragility of the siren, by throwing it on the ground, and&nbsp;although I would have
                hesitated to keep the animal out of&nbsp;the water for several hours, while I knew
                that respectable&nbsp;naturalists doubted if it would live more than a few
                minutes&nbsp;out of that element, yet it so happened that the creature&nbsp;on one
                occasion made of its own accord an experiment (if&nbsp;it may be so called)
                illustrative of both points. The water-box itself (in which the siren dwelt) was ten
                inches&nbsp;deep : it was placed on a plant trellis or shelf, close by
                the&nbsp;lower end of the sloping roof-sash of the green-house, and&nbsp;thus stood
                nearly three feet from the ground. At that pe-</span></p>
