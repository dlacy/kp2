<p><span class="font0">Everdingen, whose manner he copied at one period. Only a single architectural subject from his brush is known an&nbsp;admirable interior of the New Church, Amsterdam, in the&nbsp;possession of the marquess of Bute. The prevailing hue of&nbsp;his landscapes is a full rich green, which, however, has darkened&nbsp;with time, while a clear grey tone is characteristic of his sea-pieces. The art of Ruysdael, while it shows little of the&nbsp;scientific knowledge of later landscapists, is sensitive and&nbsp;poetic in sentiment, and direct and skilful in technique. Figures&nbsp;are sparingly introduced into his compositions, and such as&nbsp;occur are believed to be from the pencils of Adrian Vandevelde,&nbsp;Philip Wouwerman, and Jan Lingelbach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unlike the other gTeat Dutch landscape painters, Ruysdael did not aim at a pictorial record of particular scenes, but he&nbsp;carefully thought out and arranged his compositions, introducing into them an infinite variety of subtle contrasts in the&nbsp;formation of the clouds, the plants and tree forms, and the&nbsp;play of light. He particularly excels in the painting of cloudy&nbsp;skies which are spanned dome-like over the landscape, and&nbsp;determine the light and shade of the objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Characteristic of his early period, from about 1646 to 1653, is the choice of very simple </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">motifs</span><span class="font0"> and the careful and laborious&nbsp;study of the details of nature. The time between his departure&nbsp;from Haarlem and his settling in Amsterdam may have been&nbsp;spent in travelling and helped him to gain a broader view of&nbsp;nature and to widen the horizon of his art. Mr Otto Beit&nbsp;owns a magnificent view of the “ Castle of Bentheim,” dated&nbsp;1654, from which it may be concluded that his wanderings&nbsp;extended to Germany. In his last period, from about 1675&nbsp;onwards, he shows a tendency towards overcrowded compositions, and affects a darker tonality, which may partly be&nbsp;due to the use of thin paint on a dark ground. Towards the&nbsp;end, in his leaning towards the romantic mood, he preferred&nbsp;to draw his inspiration from other masters, instead of going&nbsp;to nature direct, his favourite subjects being rushing torrents&nbsp;and waterfalls, and ruined castles on mountain crests, which&nbsp;are frequently borrowed from the Swiss views by Roghman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruysdael etched a few plates, which were reproduced by Amand Durand in 1878, with text by Georges Duplessis. The “ Cornfield ”&nbsp;and the “ Travellers ” are characterized by M. Duplessis as prints&nbsp;of a high order which may be regarded as the most significant&nbsp;expressions of landscape art in the Low Countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYAN, LACY </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1694-1760), English actor, appeared at the Haymarket about 1709. By 1718 he had joined the company&nbsp;at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where he shared the lead 'with his friend&nbsp;Quin. In 1732 he followed the company to Covent Garden,&nbsp;and there he remained until his death.

<p><span class="font0">RYAZAN, a government of central Russia, bounded by the governments of Moscow and Tula on the W., by Vladimir on the&nbsp;N., and by Tambov on the E. and S., with an area of 16,250&nbsp;sq. m. Ryazan is an intermediate link between the central&nbsp;Great Russian governments and the steppe governments of the&nbsp;S.E.—the wide and deep valley of the Oka being the natural&nbsp;boundary between the two. On the left of the Oka the surface&nbsp;often consists of sand, marshes and forests; while on the right&nbsp;the fertile black-earth prairies begin, occupying especially the&nbsp;districts of Ranenburg, Sapozhok and Dankov. The whole of&nbsp;Ryazan is a plateau about 700 ft. above the sea, but deeply cut&nbsp;by the river* valleys and numerous ravines. Iron-ores, limestone, grindstone grits, potters’ clays, and thick beds of peat are&nbsp;worked, besides coal. The N. belongs to the forest regions, and,&nbsp;notwithstanding the wholesale destruction of forests, these&nbsp;(chiefly coniferous) in several districts still cover one-third of the&nbsp;surface. In the S., where the proximity of the steppes is felt,&nbsp;they are much less extensive, the prevailing species being oak,&nbsp;birch, and other deciduous trees. Altogether forests cover&nbsp;about one-fifth of the total area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Oka is the chief river; it is navigable throughout, and receives the navigable Pronya and Pra, besides a great many smaller&nbsp;streams utilized for floating timber. Steamers ply on the Oka to&nbsp;Kasimov and Nizhniy-Novgorod. The Don belongs to Ryazan&nbsp;in its upper course only. On the whole, the S. districts are not&nbsp;well watered. Small lakes are numerous in the broad depression&nbsp;of the Oka and elsewhere, while extensive marshes occur in the&nbsp;N.E. districts; a few attempts at draining some of these beside&nbsp;the Oka have resulted in the reclamation of excellent pasture lands.&nbsp;The climate is a little warmer than at Moscow, the average temperature at the city of Ryazan being 40°; February, 3°*2; July, 67 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The estimated population in 1906 was 2,100,900, and is nearly Great Russian throughout, containing only a trifling admixture&nbsp;of Tatars, Poles and Jews in towns. Some Tatars immigrated&nbsp;into the Kasimov region in the 15th century, and are noted for&nbsp;their honesty of character as well as for their agricultural&nbsp;prosperity. The people of the Pra river are described as Mesh-cheryaks, but their manners and customs do not differ from&nbsp;those of the Russians. The chief occupation is agriculture.&nbsp;Out of the total area only 8% is unfit for tillage, and between&nbsp;50 and 60% is under crops; although the area under cultivation and the crops themselves are increasing, yet even here, in&nbsp;one of the wealthiest governments of Russia, the situation of&nbsp;the peasants is far from satisfactory. Live-stock breeding is&nbsp;rapidly falling off on account of want of pasture lands, but hay,&nbsp;which is abundant, especially on the rich meadow lands of the&nbsp;Oka, is exported. More than half of the land (52%) is owned&nbsp;by the village communities, 40% by private owners, 5% by the&nbsp;crown, and 2 % by various institutions. During the last thirty&nbsp;years of the 19th century the nobles sold 36% (1,261,000 acres)&nbsp;of their lands, mainly to merchants and peasants; the latter&nbsp;cultivate two-thirds of the total cultivated area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal crops are oats, rye and potatoes, with wheat, barley, buckwheat, flax, hemp, tobacco, hops and fruit. But the&nbsp;crops are insufficient for the needs of the inhabitants. Tobacco,&nbsp;hops., vegetables and fruit, however, are grown for export. Beekeeping is developing and manufactures increasing, the factories&nbsp;being chiefly cotton and flax mills, flour mills, machine works,&nbsp;tanneries, soap works, boot, cement, glass and match factories,&nbsp;distilleries, and chemical works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The government is divided into twelve districts,” the chief towns of which are Ryazan, Dankov, Egorievsk, Kasimov, Mikhailov,&nbsp;Pronsk, Ranenburg, Ryazhsk, Sapozhok, Skopin, Spask and&nbsp;Zaraisk. Small industries, such as boat-building, the preparation&nbsp;of pitch and tar, the making of wooden vessels and sledges, matweaving and. boot-making, are carried on in the villages, especially&nbsp;in the N., which belongs, properly speaking, to the Vladimir industrial&nbsp;region. Domestic trades, such as lace-making (supported by two&nbsp;schools) and embroidering on leather, give occupation to 40,000&nbsp;women. Trade, especially in corn and manufactured goods, </span><span class="font1">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">brisk, and has been stimulated by the opening of coal-mines, e.g.&nbsp;in the district of Skopin. Considerable efforts have been made by&nbsp;the local governing bodies to increase the number of schools. Most&nbsp;interesting archaeological finds have been made in the government,&nbsp;and have been placed in the new museum at the city of Ryazan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Slavs began to colonize the region of Ryazan as early as the 9th century, penetrating thither both from the N.W. (Great Russians)&nbsp;and from.the.Dnieper (Little Russians). As early as the loth century&nbsp;the principality of Murom and Ryazan is mentioned in the chronicles.&nbsp;During the following centuries this principality increased both in&nbsp;extent and in wealth, and included parts of what are now the governments of Kaluga and Moscow. Owing to the fertility of the soil,&nbsp;its.Russian population rapidly increased, while the Finnish tribes&nbsp;which formerly inhabited it migrated farther E., or became merged&nbsp;among the Slavs. The Mongol invasion of 1239^42 stopped all&nbsp;development. The principality, however,, still continued to exist;&nbsp;its princes, strongly opposed the annexation by Moscow, making&nbsp;alliance with the Mongols and with Lithuania, but they finally&nbsp;succumbed, and the principality was definitely annexed in 1517.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYAZAN, a town of Russia, capital of the government of the same name, 124 m. by rail S.E. of Moscow, on the elevated&nbsp;right bank of the Trubezh, a mile above its confluence wfith&nbsp;the Oka. Pop. (1897) 44,552. A wide prairie dotted with large&nbsp;villages, the bottom of a former lake, spreads out from the&nbsp;base of the crag on which Ryazan stands, and actually has the&nbsp;aspect of an immense lake when it is inundated in the spring.&nbsp;Ryazan is the see of an archbishop of the Orthodox Greek&nbsp;Church. The cathedral, first built in the 17th century, was&nbsp;reconstructed in 1776. The Krestovozdvizhensk church contains tombs of the princes of the 15th and 16th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The capital of Ryazan principality was Ryazan—now Old Ryazan, a village close to Spask, also on the Oka. It is&nbsp;mentioned in annals as early as 1097, but continued to be the&nbsp;chief town of the principality only until the 14th century. In&nbsp;the nth century one of the Kiev princes founded, on the banks</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
