                Europe, at least in that form, was the principal sacrifice as well in India as in
                Irân. The close&nbsp;relation of the Teutonic and Norse religions, and of
                the&nbsp;mythology and rites of the Greeks and Romans, even if&nbsp;we carefully
                except all that the latter took from the former&nbsp;in historical times, is
                sufficiently proved. It is not so&nbsp;evident, but still highly probable, that the
                religions of the&nbsp;north-western and the south-eastern Celts, though
                differing&nbsp;from one another in historical times, are daughters of
                one&nbsp;ancient </span><span class="font0"

                religion, for the&nbsp;Letto-Slavic religions, we do so by way of an
                hypothesis,&nbsp;based on the analogy with the other branches of the&nbsp;family.
                What we know about these and about the Celtic&nbsp;forms of worship is so defective
                that we cannot speak&nbsp;more positively. As for the Phrygian religion, it
                seems&nbsp;to belong to the Iranian stock, and to form the transition&nbsp;from the
                Persian to the Greek or Pelasgic worship.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">There may have been some other intermediate stages, besides those

                primitive than has been generally&nbsp;thought until now. It contains ancient
                elements, but it is&nbsp;itself the product of relatively modern speculations,
                and&nbsp;belongs to a period in which a complicated and mystical&nbsp;sacrificial
                theory was upheld by priests of various functions and ranks. On the other hand it
                cannot be denied&nbsp;that the Zarathustric dogmas are pure old Aryan myths
                in&nbsp;a new shape—this is what M. Jas. Darmesteter has proved&nbsp;—but it was
                doubtless a reformer, or, if Zarathustra was&nbsp;no historical person, a body of
                reformers, who called the&nbsp;Zarathustric religion into existence. Therefore,

                class="font0">Though there is so much wanting in our knowledge of the Semitic
                religions, especially as&nbsp;regards those of the pre-Christian Aramæans, of the
                pre-Islamic Arabs, and of the old Hebrews, all we know about&nbsp;them tends to
                prove that they too must have descended&nbsp;from a common source. When wo find that
                the same&nbsp;divinities were worshipped by several North-Semitic nations&nbsp;it
                might be contended that they were borrowed from one&nbsp;of them, as trade and
                conquest had brought them from&nbsp;ancient times into close contact with one
                another. But&nbsp;no such relation existed till the very last centuries of
                the&nbsp;Assyrian empire between the Northern Semites and the&nbsp;various tribes of
                the Arabian desert. Therefore gods and&nbsp;religious ideas and customs prevailing
                alike among the&nbsp;northern and the southern or Arabic branch of the race&nbsp;may
                be safely regarded as the primeval property of the&nbsp;whole family. Such are the
                general name for the godhead,&nbsp;Ilu, El, Hah (in Allah), and the gods Serakh or
                Sherag&nbsp;(2&lt;φαχoς, Assyr., Arab., Cypr.), Keivan (Kaivanu,
                Babyl.,&nbsp;Assyr., Arab., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                Assyr., Arab.), as one of three different forms, of&nbsp;which another, the Al-'Uzza
                of the Arabs, is met with&nbsp;as 'Uza or 'Aza in Phoenician inscriptions, while
                the&nbsp;corresponding male god Aziz is found among the&nbsp;Aramæans, and the
                third, Manât, corresponds to Meni,&nbsp;the “minor Fortune,” the planet Venus of the
                Hebrews,&nbsp;perhaps also with the Babylonian Manu. The myth of&nbsp;the dying and
                reviving Thammuz, Dumuzi, common to all&nbsp;Northern Semites, seems not to have
                been current among&nbsp;the ancient Arabs, though some scholars (Krehl, Lenor-mant)
                think there are traces of it left in their traditions&nbsp;and rites. Tree worship
                and stone worship have been&nbsp;pretty general in prehistoric times, and not a few
                remains&nbsp;of both have survived in all ancient faiths and
                modern&nbsp;superstitions ; but the latter was particularly developed&nbsp;among
                both Northern and Southern Semites, which is&nbsp;proved by the use of Betyles
                    (7K&quot;ΓP□)<sub>j</sub> by the black stone&nbsp;in the Ka'ba, the stone at
                Bethel, that in the temple of&nbsp;the great goddess of Cyprus at Paphos, at Edessa,
                and&nbsp;elsewhere, by the seven black stones representing the&nbsp;planet-gods at
                Erech (Uruk) in Chaldæa, Ac. Holy&nbsp;mountains too are very frequent among the
                Semites,&nbsp;alike in Arabia (Kaçi, Dhu-l-shera, Horeb, Sinai—the
                two&nbsp;last-named still worshipped by the Saracens in the 6th&nbsp;century of our
                era) and in Canaan (Hermon, Tabor, comp,&nbsp;the Tabyrios and Zeus Atabyrios in
