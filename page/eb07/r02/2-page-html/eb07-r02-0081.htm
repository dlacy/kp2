<p><span class="font0">and to relieve that of Amadis, who is the very essence of chivalrous constancy, he has introduced Don Galaor, his&nbsp;brother, a gay libertine in love, whose adventures form a&nbsp;contrast with those of his more serious relative. Above all,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font0"> displays an attention to the style and conversation of the piece, which, although its effects are now exaggerated and ridiculous, was doubtless at the time considered as the pitch of elegance ; and here were, for the first&nbsp;time, introduced those hyperbolical compliments, and that&nbsp;inflated and complicated structure of language, the sense of&nbsp;which walks as in a masquerade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font0"> at first consisted only of four books, and in that limited shape may be considered as a very well conducted story ; but additions were speedily made which extended the number to twenty-four ; containing the history&nbsp;of Amadis subsequent to his obtaining possession of Oriana,&nbsp;and down to his death, as also of his numerous descendants. The theme was not yet exhausted ; for, as the ancient romancers, when they commenced a new work, chose&nbsp;for their hero some newly invented Paladin of Charlemagne,&nbsp;or knight of King Arthur, so did their successors adopt a&nbsp;new descendant of the family of Amadis, whose genealogy&nbsp;was thus multiplied to a prodigious degree. For an accountof&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esplandian, Florimond of Greece, Palmeriη of England,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the other romances of this class, the reader must be&nbsp;referred to the valuable labours of Mr. Southey, who has&nbsp;abridged both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palmeriη,</span><span class="font0"> with the most accurate attention to the style and manners of the original. The&nbsp;books of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis</span><span class="font0"> became so very popular, as to supersede&nbsp;the elder romances almost entirely, even at the court of&nbsp;France, where, according to La Noue, already quoted, they&nbsp;were introduced about the reign of Henry II. It was against&nbsp;the extravagance of these fictions in character and in style,&nbsp;that the satire of Cervantes was chiefly directed ; and almost all the library of Don Quixote belongs to this class of&nbsp;romances, which, no doubt, his adventures contributed much&nbsp;to put out of fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In every point of view, France must be considered as the country in which chivalry and romance flourished in the&nbsp;highest perfection ; and the originals of almost all the early&nbsp;romances, whether in prose or in verse, whether relating to&nbsp;the history of Arthur or of Charlemagne, are to be found&nbsp;in the French language ; and other countries possess only&nbsp;translations from thence. This will not be so surprising&nbsp;when it is recollected, that these earlier romances were written, not only for the use of the French, but of the English&nbsp;themselves, among whom French was the prevailing language during the reigns of the Anglo-Norman monarchs.&nbsp;Indeed, it has been ingeniously supposed, and not without&nbsp;much apparent probability, that the fame of Arthur was&nbsp;taken by the French minstrels for the foundation of their&nbsp;stories in honour of the English kings, who reigned over&nbsp;the supposed dominions of that British hero ; while, on the&nbsp;other hand, the minstrels who repaired to the coast of France,&nbsp;celebrated the prow ess of Charlemagne and his twelve peers&nbsp;as a subject more gratifying to those who sat upon his throne.&nbsp;It is perhaps, some objection to this ingenious theory, that,&nbsp;as we have already seen, the battle of Hastings was opened&nbsp;by a minstrel, who sung the war-song of Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne ; so that the Norman duke brought&nbsp;with him to England the tales that are supposed, at a much&nbsp;later date, to have been revived to soothe the national pride&nbsp;of the French minstrels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How the French minstrels came originally by the traditional reliquesconcerning Arthurand Merlin, on which they wrought&nbsp;so long and so largely, must, we fear, always remain uncertain. From the Saxons we may conclude they had them&nbsp;not ; for the Saxons were the very enemies against whom&nbsp;Arthur employed his good sword excalibar, that is to say,&nbsp;if there was such a man, or such a weapon. We know, indeed, that thc British, like all the branches of the Celtic&nbsp;race, were much attached to poetry and music, which the&nbsp;numerous relics of ancient poetry in Wales, Ireland, and&nbsp;the Highlands of Scotland, sufficiently evince. Arthur, a&nbsp;name famous amongst them, with some traditions concerning&nbsp;the sage Merlin, may have floated either in Armorica, or&nbsp;among the half-British of the borders of Scotland, and of&nbsp;Cumberland ; and thus preserved, may have reached the&nbsp;ear of the Norman minstrels, either in their newly conquered dominions, or through their neighbours of Brittany.&nbsp;A theme of this sort once discovered, and found acceptable&nbsp;to the popular ear, gave rise, of course, to a thousand imitations ; and gradually drew around it a cloud of fiction&nbsp;which, embellished by such poetry as the minstrels could&nbsp;produce, arranged itself by degrees into a system of fabulous history, as the congregated vapours touched by the&nbsp;setting sun, assume the form of battlements and towers.&nbsp;We know that the history of Sir Tristrem, first versified by&nbsp;Thomas the Rhymer of Erceldoune, w-as derived from Welsh&nbsp;traditions, though told by a Saxon poet. In fact, it may&nbsp;be easily supposed, that the romancers of that early period&nbsp;were more eager to acquire popular subjects than delicately&nbsp;scrupulous of borrowing from their neighbours ; and when&nbsp;the foundation-stone was once laid, each subsequent minstrel brought his contribution to the building. The idea&nbsp;of an association of knights assembled around one mighty&nbsp;sovereign, was so flattering to all the ruling princes of Europe, that almost all of them endeavoured to put themselves&nbsp;at the head of some similar institution, and the various orders&nbsp;of chivalry are to be traced to this origin. The historical&nbsp;foundation ofthishuge superstructure is almost imperceptible.&nbsp;Mr. Turner has shewn that the evidence rather inclines to&nbsp;prove the actual existence of King Arthur ; and the names&nbsp;of Gawain, his nephew, and of Genuera, his faithful spouse,&nbsp;of Mordred, and Merlin, were preserved by Welsh tradition.&nbsp;To the same source may be referred the loves of Tristrem&nbsp;and Ysolde, which, although a separate story, has become,&nbsp;in the later romances, amalgamated with that of Arthur.&nbsp;But there can be little doubt that all beyond the bare names&nbsp;of the heroes owes its existence to the imagination of the&nbsp;romancers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It might be thought that the romances referring to the feats of Charlemagne ought to contain more historical truth&nbsp;than those concerning Arthur ; since the former relate to a&nbsp;well-known monarch and conqueror, the latter to a personage of a very doubtful and shadowy existence. But the&nbsp;romances concerning both are equally fabulous. Charles&nbsp;had, indeed, an officer named Roland, who was slain with&nbsp;other nobles in the field of Roncesvalles, fighting, not against&nbsp;the Saracens or Spaniards, but against the Gascons. This&nbsp;is the only point upon which the real history of Charlemagne coincides with that invented for him by romancers.&nbsp;Roland was prefect of Bretagne, and his memory was long&nbsp;preserved in the war-song which bore his name. A fabulous chronicler, calling himself Turpin, compiled, in or about&nbsp;the eleventh century, a romantic history of Charlemagne ;&nbsp;but it may be doubted whether, in some instances, he has&nbsp;not availed himself of the fictions already devised by the&nbsp;early romancers, while to those who succeeded them his&nbsp;annals afforded matter for new figments. The personal&nbsp;character of Charlemagne has suffered considerably in the&nbsp;hands of the romantic authors, although they exaggerated&nbsp;his power and his victories. He is represented as fond of&nbsp;flattery, irritable in his temper, ungrateful for the services&nbsp;rendered him by his most w<sup>τ</sup>orthy paladins, and a perpetual&nbsp;dupe to the treacherous artifices of Count Gam, or Ganelon, of Mayence ; a renegade, to whom tlle romancers impute the defeat at Roncesvalles, and all the other misfortunes of the reign of Charles. This unfavourable view of&nbsp;the prince, although it may bear some features of royalty,&nbsp;neither resembles the real character of the conqueror of the&nbsp;Saxons and Lombards, nor can be easily reconciled with tlle</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
