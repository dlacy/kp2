The power is the relative height of the column of fluid which tends to move along the inclined plane of its bed ; the resistance is the friction of the bed, the viscidity of the fluid, and its adhesion to the sides. Here is necessarily combined a number of circumstances which must be gradually detached, that we may see the effect of each, viz. the extent of the bed, its perimeter, and its slope. By examining the effects produced by variations of each of these separately, we discover what share each has in the general effect ; and having thus analysed the complicated phenomena, we shall be able to combine those its elements, and frame a formula which shall comprehend every circumstance, from the greatest velocity to the extinction of all motion, and from the extent of a river to the narrow dimensions of a quill. We shall compare this formula with a series of experiments in all this variety of circumstances, partly made by Du Buat, and partly collected from other authors; and we shall leave the reader to judge of the agreement.</p><p>Confident that this agreement will be found most satisfactory, we shall then proceed to consider very cursorily the chief varieties which nature or art may introduce into these beds, the different velocities of the same stream, the intensity of the resistance produced by the inertia of the materials of the channel, and the force of the current by which it continually acts on this channel, tending to change either its dimensions or its form. We shall endeavour to trace the origin of these great rivers which spread like the branches of a vigorous tree, and occupy the surface even of a vast continent. We shall follow them in their course, unfold all their windings, study their train and regimen, and point out the law of its stability ; and we shall investigate the causes of their deviations and wanderings.</p><p>The study of these natural laws pleases the mind : but it answers a still greater purpose ; it enables us to assist nature, and to hasten her operations, which our wants and our impatience often find too slow. It enables us to command the elements, and to force them to administer to our wants and our pleasures.</p><p>We shall therefore, in the next place, apply the knowledge which we may acquire to the solution of the most important hydraulic questions which occur in the practice of the civil engineer.</p><p>We shall consider the effects produced by a permanent addition to any river or stream by the union of another, and the opposite effect produced by any draught or offset, showing the elevation or depression produced up the stream, and the change made in the depth and velocity below the addition or offset.</p><p>We shall pay a similar attention to the temporary swells produced by freshes.</p><p>We shall ascertain the effects of straightening the course of a stream, which, by increasing its slope, must increase its velocity, and therefore sink the waters above the place where the curvature was removed, and diminish the tendency to overflow, while the same immediate consequence must expose the places farther down to the risk of floods, from which they would otherwise have been free.</p><p>The effects of dams or weirs, and of bars, must then be considered ; the gorge or swell which they produce up the stream must be determined for every distance from the weir or bar. This will furnish us with rules for rendering navigable or floatable such waters as have too little depth or too great slope. And it will appear that immense advantages may be thus derived, with a moderate expense, even from trifling brooks, if we will relinquish all prejudices, and not imagine that such conveyance is impossible because it cannot be carried on by such boats and small craft as we have been accustomed to look at.</p><p>The effects of canals of derivation, the rules or maxims of draining, and the general maxims of embankment, come in the next place ; and our discussions will conclude with remarks on the most proper forms for the entry to canals, locks, docks, harbours, and mouths of rivers, the best shape for the startlings of bridges and of boats for inland navigation, and such like subordinate but interesting particulars, which will be suggested by the general thread of discussion.</p><p>It is considered as physically demonstrated (see Hydrodynamics), that water issuing from a small orifice in the bottom or side of a very large vessel, almost instantly acquires and maintains the velocity which a heavy body would acquire by falling to the orifice from the horizontal surface of the stagnant water. This we shall call its natural velocity. Therefore, if we multiply the area of the orifice by this velocity, the product will be the bulk or quantity of the water which is discharged. This we may call the natural expense of water, or the natural discharge.</p><p>Let O represent the area or section of the orifice expressed in some known measure, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  its depth under the surface. Let <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  express the velocity acquired by a heavy body during a second by falling. Let V be the medium velocity of the water’s motion, Q the quantity of water discharged during a second, and N the natural expense.</p><p>We know that V is equal to <hi rend="italic">V2g × &lt;fh.</hi>  Therefore N = O √¾) √A.</p><p>If these dimensions be all taken in English feet, we have √2^ very nearly equal to 8 ; and therefore V = 8 ,<hi rend="sub">t</hi>∕λ, and N = O 8 √Λ.</p><p>But in our present business it is much more convenient to measure every thing by inches. Therefore, since a body acquires the velocity of 32 feet 2 inches in a second, we have <hi rend="italic">2g =</hi>  64 feet 4 inches, or 772 inches, and √2y = 27∙78 inches, nearly 27¼ inches.</p><p>Therefore V = √772 √Λ, = 27∙78 √A, and N = O √772 √A, = O 27∙78 √A.</p><p>But it is also well known, that if we were to calculate the expense or discharge for every orifice by this simple rule, we should in every instance find it much greater than nature really gives us.</p><p>When water issues through a hole in a thin plate, the lateral columns, pressing into the hole from all sides, cause the issuing filaments to converge to the axis of the jet, and contract its dimensions at a little distance from the hole. And it is in this place of greatest contraction that the water acquires that velocity which we observe in our experiments, and which we assume as equal to that acquired by falling from the surface. Therefore, that our computed discharge may best agree with observation, it must be calculated on the supposition that the orifice is diminished to the size of this smallest section. But the contraction is subject to variations, and the dimensions of this smallest section are at all times difficult to ascertain with precision. It is therefore much more convenient to compute from the real dimensions of the orifice, and to correct this computed discharge, by means of an actual comparison of the computed and effective discharges in a series of experiments made in situations resembling those cases which most frequently occur in practice. This correction, or its cause, in the mechanism of those internal motions, is generally called contraction by the writers on hydraulics ; and it is not confined to a hole in a thin plate : it happens in some degree in all cases where fluids are made to pass through narrow places. It happens in the entry into all pipes, canals, and sluices ; nay even into the passage of water over the edge of a board, such as is usually set up on the head of a</p></body></text></TEI>
