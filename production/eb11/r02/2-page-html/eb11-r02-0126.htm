<p><span class="font1">to that of the Mammalia, whilst the abdominal diaphragm undoubtedly causes abdominal respiration. We have seen&nbsp;that these crocodilian conditions do not stand quite alone, but&nbsp;are connected with simpler features in the other reptiles. Two&nbsp;recent, very lengthy papers have been written on this subject&nbsp;by I. Bromann (1904) and by F. Hochstetter (1906), besides two&nbsp;in 1902 by </span><span class="font0">G. </span><span class="font1">Butler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heart</span><span class="font1"> of all reptiles is removed from the head and is placed well in the thorax, in the Varanidae even a little beyond&nbsp;it. Only in snakes the heart lies headwards from the hilus of&nbsp;the lungs, not caudälwards, generally at about the end of the&nbsp;first fifth of the body. The batrachian conus arteriosus is&nbsp;reduced, one set of semilunar valves guarding the entrances&nbsp;into the truncus arteriosus which now issues directly from the&nbsp;heart. A sinus venosus exists still in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> and Chelonians,&nbsp;in which it may even receive separate hepatic veins, but in&nbsp;crocodiles, lizards and snakes the sinus as such exists no&nbsp;longer, forming part of the right atrium. AU the hepatic veins&nbsp;enter the stem of the posterior vena cava, which henceforth&nbsp;enters the heart as inferior vena cava. This, the largest, and&nbsp;the right and left anterior vena cavae, are the only three veins&nbsp;which enter the right atrium. Into the left open the two pulmonary veins. Right and left atrium have in all reptiles a&nbsp;complete septum between them. The ventricular portion shows&nbsp;considerable steps towards the differentiation into a right and&nbsp;a left ventricle, but the partition is very incomplete in tortoises,&nbsp;lizards and snakes, quite complete only in the crocodiles. The&nbsp;most important character of the reptilian heart, absolutely&nbsp;diagnostic of it, is the fact that the systemic vessel which leaves&nbsp;the right ventricle turns to the left to form the left aorta, while&nbsp;the stem which comes from the left ventricular half arches over&nbsp;to the right as the right aorta. It is not at all necessary to&nbsp;conclude that this fact excludes the reptiles from the mammalian&nbsp;ancestry and to hark back to conditions as indifferent as are&nbsp;those of the batrachia. The Foramen Panizzae shows the way&nbsp;to a solution, how ultimately all the arterial blood from the&nbsp;left ventricle may pass, first through the root of the right arch,&nbsp;then through this hole into the left, whilst the rest of the right&nbsp;arch, and the root of the left, obliterate. The difficulty is not&nbsp;much greater than that of deriving the birds’ condition from&nbsp;the reptilian. The Foramen Panizzae, which exists only in&nbsp;the Crocodilia, lies exactly where the right crosses dorsally over&nbsp;the left aorta. The whole is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> the last remnant of the originally&nbsp;undivided truncus, as is taught generally, but it is a new foramen,&nbsp;a hole dug by the left arterial blood into the venous right aorta.&nbsp;According to the recent observations made by F. Hochstetter&nbsp;the foramen comes into existence in a very late embryonic&nbsp;stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whilst the batrachian single ventricle possesses only one ostium Ventriculare or outlet into the truncus, in the reptiles&nbsp;the inter-atrial, septum extends considerably downwards into&nbsp;the base of the ventricle, so as to produce a right and a left&nbsp;niche, and correspondingly two ostia instead of one. The atrioventricular valves are still membranous, even in crocodiles;&nbsp;attached to them are muscles, trabeculae cameae, from the&nbsp;very trabecular walls of the ventricle; they are especially&nbsp;spongy in tortoises. By means of the arrangement of some of&nbsp;these trabeculae, perhaps still more through the confluence of&nbsp;their basal portions, an imperfect ventricular septum is initiated.&nbsp;Certainly even in tortoises, which represent the lowest stage,&nbsp;the venous blood is received into and sent out by the same right&nbsp;side of the ventricle, while the arterial blood is correspondingly&nbsp;managed and dodged by the left side. That there is not very&nbsp;much mixture of the two kinds of blood, in spite of the wide&nbsp;communication in the ventricle, is further due to the peristaltic&nbsp;systole and diastole of the various divisions of the heart.—The&nbsp;heart of Chelonians is broader than long. In correlation with&nbsp;the very much flattened body of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> and its allied genera,&nbsp;the whole heart is dislodged from the middle line, far over to the&nbsp;right side; the vessels of the left side are correspondingly much&nbsp;elongated and have to cross the neck, trachea and oesophagus.—&nbsp;The apex of the heart is attached to the pericardium by a special&nbsp;ligament in the Crocodilia and in many Chelonia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Testudo,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but it is absent in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clemmys.</span><span class="font1"> Sometimes this little ligament&nbsp;sends a tiny blood vessel into the liver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arterial System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodiles.—</span><span class="font1">The<sup>z</sup>Zc// aorta crosses obliquely beneath the right and gives off only the coeliac, just before joining the right aorta&nbsp;in the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra. The aorta&nbsp;descendens sends off, besides intercostals and other segmentais&nbsp;into the body-wall, the mesenteric, right and left iliac, a pair of&nbsp;renal and ischiadics, a cloacal and the caudal artery. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">right&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">aorta forms the main root of the a. descendens. Close to the&nbsp;heart it sends off two coronaries and a short carotis primaria&nbsp;which divides at once into two anonymae, the left of which is the&nbsp;stronger. The right anonyma divides into the subclavia and&nbsp;collateralis colli, the left into subclavia and carotis subverte-bralis. Each subclavia sends off an a. Vertebralis communis,&nbsp;which runs headwards and, with another longer branch, downwards, giving off intercostals, and then joins the descending&nbsp;aorta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tortoises.</span><span class="font1">—The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">left</span><span class="font1"> aorta is rather more separated from the truncus, which it crosses ventrally in an oblique forward direction; it sends off a left cardiac to stomach and oesophagus,&nbsp;a coeliac and mesenteric, and then a communicating branch&nbsp;to the right aorta. The a. descendens gives off paired supra-renals, spermatics, very large iliacs, then a pair of renals,&nbsp;hypogastrics and the caudal. Each iliac artery divides into a&nbsp;recurrent intercostal anastomosing with the axillaries, an&nbsp;epigastric (sending off the crural and anastomosing with&nbsp;thoracics and humerais), and other arteries to abdominal&nbsp;muscles and to the shell. The hypogastrics supply the cloacal&nbsp;region and then continue as the ischiadics. But there are many&nbsp;anastomoses which cause great variation in the different&nbsp;tortoises. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font1"> aorta sends off a right cardiac, the coronary,&nbsp;and the right and left anonymae which are quite symmetrical,&nbsp;each dividing into subclavia and carotis; in the angle lies the&nbsp;thymus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lizards.—</span><span class="font1">Two common carotids arise either side by side, or by one carotis primaria, from the right aortic root. In the&nbsp;majority each common carotis ascends the neck and then divides&nbsp;into the vessels for thc head and another branch which turns&nbsp;back and goes into the descending part of the aortic arch. In&nbsp;chameleons two carotid stems ascend the neck and there is no&nbsp;recurrent vessel. In the Varanidae the two common carotids&nbsp;start from a long carotis primaria; there is no recurrent vessel.&nbsp;The vertebral arteries come from the origin of the subclavians&nbsp;and run to the head in a very lateral position. The subclavian&nbsp;arteries (which occùr also in limbless lizards) arise far away from&nbsp;the carotids out of the descending arch of the right aorta, in a&nbsp;level often far behind the heart. “ Anonymous ” arteries are&nbsp;consequently absent in lizards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Snakes.</span><span class="font1">—The left aorta is stronger than the right, both combining soon to form the descending aorta. Owing to the absence of fore limbs and shoulder-girdle the conditions are much simplified. In most snakes the right aorta sends off but one strong&nbsp;carotic vessel which represents the left carotis communis whilst&nbsp;the right is much reduced or even quite absent; further, there is&nbsp;only one vertebral artery, which either runs along the right side&nbsp;of the vertebral column or it divides soon into a right and a&nbsp;left vessel along the neck. In conformity with the reduction&nbsp;of one lung there is usually but one pulmonary vessel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Venous System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodiles.—</span><span class="font1">Éach, right and left, anterior vena cava is composed of a subclavian (axillary and external jugular), an internal jugular, common vertebral and an internal mammary vein.&nbsp;The posterior vena cava is composed of the two revehent renais,&nbsp;veins from the genital glands and ducts, revehent veins of the&nbsp;Suprarenals (which, like birds, still have a portal system), and&nbsp;the big vein from the fat body. Thus the vena cava posterior</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
