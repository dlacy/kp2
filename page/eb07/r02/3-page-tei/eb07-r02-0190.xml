He said that, notwithstanding the declaration made, in both cases, of his being totally unfettered, yet he never could feel real independence while he thus held his place in the Commons by favour ; and, he adds, “ I formed to myself an unalterable resolution, <hi rend="italic">never,</hi>  unless I held a public office, to come into parliament but by a popular election, or by paying the common price for my seat. As to the first of these, I knew, of course, that I must never look for it; and as for the latter, I determined to wait till the labours of my profession should have enabled me to accomplish it without being guilty of any great extravagance.” He was soon rewarded for the scrupulous feeling of honour which had thus forced him to decline a place, that held out to him, as he confesses, very strong temptations.</p><p>In February 1806, he was appointed Solicitor General under the government of Mr Fox and Lord Grenville, with neither of whom had he previously any connexion. He was obliged, much against his will, to accept the honour of knighthood, and was elected to represent the borough of Qneenborough, accepting this seat, without scruple, from the government. “ If I had come in,” says he, “ as a private individual, I would not have accepted a seat from any body ; but as long as I hold the office to which I have been appointed, I must support the administration. As soon as they appear to me unworthy to be supported, it will be my duty to resign.” Of the public life which commenced under these auspices, and was prematurely brought to a close in thirteen years, Sir Samuel Romilly kept a minute and faithful diary, the contents of which have lately been made known to the world. No existing record of a political career presents a purer picture than does this ;—the history of a course of public conduct directed invariably by those qualities of mind and heart which we have, even in this hasty sketch, seen to have guided the earlier years spent in his family and in his profession. It is impossible to embrace, within these limits, so much as a catalogue of the parliamentary measures in which he took a share, in the way of inciting others to action, in the way of himself acting and speaking and writing in favour of reforms in the laws and constitution, in the way of resisting encroachments on public rights or on just economical principles. And if a selection were to be attempted of a few of his principal public acts, that selection could not be made without omitting many which, in particular views, might be considered more important than those that would be specified.</p><p>But the design which lay closest to Romilly’s heart, and occupied most of the energies of his capacious intellect, was the amelioration of the law of England, especially in its criminal sections. For such plans his official duties, added to those of his profession and of his place in parliament, allowed him at first no leisure; but from some of these trammels he was speedily released, by the fall of the Whig ministry in March 1807. In the new parliament he was returned for Horsham, on the Duke of Norfolk’s interest, engaging to pay L.2000 for his seat if he should be able to keep it in spite of a petition, which was expected to be presented in consequence of doubts entertained as to the qualification of many of the voters. The petition proved successful, and his next election was made on terms equally characteristic. A seat was offered him for Wareham, for which, although L.3000 were demanded, he was asked to pay but L.2000, the remaining L.1000 being promised from a fund subscribed for extraordinary purposes by the leaders of the opposition. Romilly peremptorily refused to be indebted even to the public men with whom he systematically acted. He accepted the seat, but paid the whole price himself.</p><p>He now occupied a very prominent position in parliament. The eyes of the most liberally organized constituencies in the country were directed towards him ; and in 1811, when a dissolution was impending, it was proposed in several such places to put him up as a candidate. For Liverpool, which was one of these, he at once refused to stand, on account of the disturbances which the contest was sure to occasion. In regard to the county of Middlesex, a negotiation was attempted by Major Cartwright, which was frustrated by Sir Samuel’s flatly refusing to give, before his nomination, a pledge in favour of annual parliaments, and of such reform as should make the suffrage co-extensive with the taxation. He however accepted a requisition from Bristol, but was defeated by a coalition between the Tories and a section of the Whigs. He then obtained a seat for Arundel, on the interest of the Duke of Norfolk, an assurance of perfect independence being given him by the patron, but no price being paid on this occasion. Romilly’s justification of his change of views is very briefly stated in his diary. His known course in parliament protected him, as he thought, from being either required by his patron to be subservient, or suspected by the public of really being so ; and therefore he could safely do that which, by a change of the law, it had now become necessary for him to do if he wished for a seat at all. “ Since Curwen’s bill,” says he, “ has declared illegal the purchase of seats in the manner which was formerly practised, there is no choice for a person like myself, but to come into parliament upon such an offer as is now made me, or to decline parliament altogether. And I cannot think that it is my duty to decline it.” This seat Romilly held till the dissolution in 1818, when he accepted a requisition from electors in Westminster, upon which a severe contest ensued. One of the two vacant seats was considered as sure for Sir Francis Burdett ; the return of Romilly for the other was opposed not only by a ministerial candidate, but by Hunt, Cartwright, and Douglas Kinnaird. Romilly and Burdett were returned, the former standing at the head of the poll from its opening till its close.</p><p>The results to which this great victory was expected to have led, were unfortunately never realized. Romilly had a constitutional tendency to hypochondria, or at least to lowness of spirits, which his continual labour both of body and mind prevented for years from reaching a dangerous height, although perhaps this very labour it was, that at length caused the overwrought organism to fall suddenly to pieces. The health of his wife, whom he idolized rather than loved, had for some time caused him serious uneasiness : she became alarmingly unwell. Soon after his election for Westminster, on the 10th of October, he closed abruptly those brief notices of her illness which had lately been the only entries in his diary ; and on the 29th of that month she died at Cowes. Her husband travelled to town, labouring, during his journey, or at any rate after it, under an inflammatory fever ; and in one of its paroxysms he put an end to his existence, three days after the death of his wife. He died on the 2d of November 1818, when he had nearly completed the sixty-second year of his age.</p><p>The public character of Sir Samuel Romilly would be best drawn by a few warm and vigorous strokes, all of which, with no exception worth noticing, would convey images of distinguished excellence. These traits would exhibit his manly and ratiocinative oratory, lighted up into eloquence by the fervour of his moral sense,—the consummate capacity, integrity, and knowledge of the law, and the comprehensive and philanthropic views of legislation, which made it a national misfortune for England that he never became one of her chancellors,—that antique spirit of mental independence, which bowed to the demands of no man, and of no party, not even his own, unless his conscience told him that those demands were just. And these virtues of the statesman and the jurisconsult, which, by their stern majesty, commanded from those that viewed them at a distance an awe not altogether unmingled with fear, were tempered in private life by the warmest and kindest feeling, by the most felicitous union of public labours with personal accomplishments.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
