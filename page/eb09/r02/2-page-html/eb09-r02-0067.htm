<p><span class="font1">extinction as a wild animal is probably only a question of time. Its breeding habits are precisely those which have&nbsp;been already described in the case of other Ratite birds.&nbsp;Like most of them it is polygamous, and the male&nbsp;performs the duty of incubation, brooding more than a&nbsp;score of eggs, the produce of several females—facts known&nbsp;to Nieremberg more than two hundred and fifty years&nbsp;since, but hardly accepted by naturalists until recently.&nbsp;From causes which, if explicable, do not here concern us,&nbsp;no examples of this bird seem to have been brought to&nbsp;Europe before the beginning of the present century, and&nbsp;accordingly the descriptions previously given of it by&nbsp;systematic writers were taken at second hand and were&nbsp;mostly defective if not misleading. In 1803 Latham&nbsp;issued a wretched figure of the species from a half-grown&nbsp;specimen in the Leverian Museum, and twenty years later&nbsp;said he had seen only one other, and that still younger, in&nbsp;Bullock’s collection </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Ge)i. Hist. Birds,</span><span class="font1"> viii. p. 379).</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> A&nbsp;bird living in confinement at Strasburg in 1806 was,&nbsp;however, described and figured by Hammer in 1808 (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.&nbsp;du Museum,</span><span class="font1"> xii. pp. 427-433, pl. 39), and, though he&nbsp;does not expressly say so, we may infer from his account&nbsp;that it had been a captive for some years. In England&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font1"> of the Zoological Society for 1833 announced&nbsp;the Rhea as having been exhibited for the first time in its&nbsp;gardens during the preceding twelvemonth. Since then&nbsp;many other living examples have been introduced, and it&nbsp;has bred both there and elsewhere in Britain, but the&nbsp;young do not seem to be very easily reared.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though considerably smaller than the Ostrich, and, as before stated, wanting its fine plumes, the Rhea in general&nbsp;aspect far more resembles that bird than the other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ratitæ.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The feathers of the head and neck, except on the crown&nbsp;and nape, where they are dark brown, are dingy white, and&nbsp;those of the body ash-coloured tinged with brown, while&nbsp;on the breast they are brownish-black, and on the belly&nbsp;and thighs white. In the course of the memorable voyage&nbsp;of the “Beagle,” Darwin came to hear of another kind of&nbsp;Rhea, called by his informants </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Avestruz petise,</span><span class="font1"> and at Port&nbsp;Desire on the east coast of Patagonia he obtained an&nbsp;example of it, the imperfect skin of which enabled Mr&nbsp;Gould to describe it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Proc. Zool. Society,</span><span class="font1"> 1837, p. 35) as a&nbsp;second species of the genus, naming it after its discoverer.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhea daηvini</span><span class="font1"> differs in several well-marked characters from&nbsp;the earlier known </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. americana.</span><span class="font1"> Its bill is shorter than&nbsp;its head ; its tarsi are reticulated instead of scutellated in&nbsp;front, with the upper part feathered instead of being bare ;&nbsp;and the plumage of its body and wings is very different,&nbsp;each feather being tipped with a distinct whitish band,&nbsp;while that of the head and neck is greyish-brown. A&nbsp;further distinction is also asserted to be shewn by the&nbsp;eggs—those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. americana</span><span class="font1"> being of a yellowish-white,&nbsp;while those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. darwini</span><span class="font1"> have a bluish tinge. Some&nbsp;years afterwards Mr Sclater described (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">op. cit.,</span><span class="font1"> 1860, p.&nbsp;207) a third and smaller species, more closely resembling&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. americana,</span><span class="font1"> but having apparently a longer bill,&nbsp;whence he named it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. rnacrorhyηcha,</span><span class="font1"> more slender tarsi,&nbsp;and shorter toes, while its general colour is very much&nbsp;darker, the body and wings being of a brownish-grey&nbsp;mixed with black. The precise geographical range of&nbsp;these three species is still undetermined. While </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R.&nbsp;americana</span><span class="font1"> is known to extend from Paraguay and&nbsp;southern Brazil through the state of La Plata to an&nbsp;uncertain distance in Patagonia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. darwini</span><span class="font1"> seems to be&nbsp;the proper inhabitant of the country last named, though</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">RHEA (or Rheea) FIBRE is a textile material yielded by one or more species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B'ohmeria</span><span class="font1"> (nat. ord. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Urticaceæ),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">plants found over a wide range in India, China, the Malay&nbsp;Peninsula and islands, and Japan. Rhea is also capable&nbsp;of being grown in temperate latitudes, and has been experimentally introduced into the south of France and Algeria.&nbsp;The most important source of rhea fibre, known also very&nbsp;inappropriately as China grass, or by its Malay name&nbsp;Ramie, is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. ηiυea.</span><span class="font1"> It is a shrubby plant growing to the&nbsp;height of from 5 to 8 feet with foliage and inflorescence&nbsp;like the common nettle, but destitute of stinging hairs.&nbsp;Some authorities consider the variety cultivated in China&nbsp;to be specifically distinct from the Indian plant. An allied&nbsp;plant called Pooalι or Puya, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. Puya,</span><span class="font1"> found growing&nbsp;wild in the north of India, is also a source of rhea fibre.&nbsp;Among the Chinese much care is bestowed on the cultivation of Chu or Tchou Ma, as rhea is called by them, and&nbsp;they prepare the fibre by a tedious and costly process of&nbsp;selection and manual labour. The plant thrives in hot,&nbsp;moist, shaded situations; propagated from slips or root&nbsp;cuttings, it throws up from three to five crops of stems in&nbsp;the course of a season, although not more than three crops&nbsp;are commonly reckoned on. Each such crop may yield&nbsp;about 250 lb of marketable fibre per acre, that total output&nbsp;being exceeded only by the jute crop. The stems when&nbsp;ripe are cut down, stripped of leaves and branchlets, and,&nbsp;either split or whole, are freed from their cortical layers&nbsp;till the bast layer is exposed. In this state they are made&nbsp;up in small bundles and placed where they receive strong&nbsp;sunlight by day and dews by night for several days, after&nbsp;which the fibrous bast layer is peeled with ease off the&nbsp;woody core, and the separated fibres are thereafter treated&nbsp;with boiling water to remove as far as possible adherent&nbsp;gummy and resinous matter in which the fibres are embedded in the stalks. The fibre so obtained is usually&nbsp;bleached by exposure on the grass, and it comes into the&nbsp;market as brilliant white filaments with a fine silky gloss,&nbsp;having a strength, lustre, and smoothness unequalled by&nbsp;any other vegetable fibre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fibre first appeared in the European market in 1810, and a cord then spun from it was found to sustain a weight of 252 lb,&nbsp;while a similar cord of Russian hemp was estimated by Admiralty&nbsp;test not to bear more than 87 lb. A fibre possessed of such strength&nbsp;and beauty immediately attracted great attention, and throughout&nbsp;the early half of the century numerous efforts were made by the East&nbsp;India Company to introduce it as a textile staple. But many difli-</span></p>
