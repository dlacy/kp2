<p><span class="font0">RHAETIC (Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetien</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhœtien;</span><span class="font0"> Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhat</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhatisch; </span><span class="font0">It. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Retico),</span><span class="font0"> in geology, the assemblage of rocks classed by most&nbsp;English and German authorities in the Triassic system, and by&nbsp;Imost French geologists placed at the base of the Lias, in the&nbsp;Jurassic system. It has been called the Infra-Lias. This&nbsp;diversity of opinion is due to the fact that the Rhaetic formation&nbsp;presents the characters of a group of passage-beds, uniting&nbsp;certain features of the Trias with others of the Jurassic system ;&nbsp;none the less, it has sufficient individuality to be recognized&nbsp;with tolerable certainty over a wide area in Europe and beyond.&nbsp;The name Rhaetic was first applied by C. W. Giimbel to the&nbsp;strata of this horizon in the Rhaetic Alps, where they are&nbsp;thickly developed and in parts fossiliferous. The labours of&nbsp;E. V. Mojsisovic and E. Suess have demonstrated that in the&nbsp;Alpine Rhaetic several distinct facies may be recognized, viz.&nbsp;a Swabian facies: shore and lagoon deposits with a pelecypod&nbsp;fauna, poor in species but rich in individuals; a Carpathian&nbsp;facies with corals, algae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Terebratula gregaria</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plicatula&nbsp;intusstriata,</span><span class="font0"> exemplified in the upper part .of the Dachstein&nbsp;limestone; a Kossener facies: black limestones and marls,&nbsp;with a brachiopod fauna in w’hich </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spirigera oxycolposis</span><span class="font0"> very&nbsp;noticeable; and a Salzburg facies, characterized by pelagic&nbsp;pelecypods and some ammonites (see table in Triassic System).&nbsp;The whole of the Rhaetic falls within Mojsisovic’s zone of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avicula&nbsp;Contorta.</span><span class="font0"> This epoch is marked off from the earlier Triassic&nbsp;period by a very general marine transgression which proceeded&nbsp;with minor irregularities and retrogressions over the whole area,&nbsp;until at its close it was followed by the more decided transgression which indicates the commencement of the Lias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the marine fossils of the Rhaetic, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avicula contorta, </span><span class="font0">the principal zone form, is very characteristic and has a wide&nbsp;range; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myophoria inflate, Modiola minute, Protocardium&nbsp;rhaeticum</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Terebratula gregaria</span><span class="font0"> are common species. True&nbsp;belemonites make their first appearance. Corals, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thecosmilia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">&amp;c., are common in some districts. Plant remains are abundant&nbsp;in certain areas, and in places give rise to beds of lignite and&nbsp;coal. The flora is more nearly akin to that of the Trias than&nbsp;to that of the Jurassic rocks. Vertebrate remains are fairly&nbsp;abundant in the form of teeth, isolated bones, scales and&nbsp;coprolites in what are known as “ Bone Beds ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> These&nbsp;beds are a very characteristic feature; they occur on several&nbsp;horizons in many tracts of the European Rhaetic, and recur in&nbsp;beds of this age in America. In England there is usually a&nbsp;bone bed about the base of the formation; in Germany one&nbsp;occupies a similar position; a second occurs less constantly&nbsp;about the middle, and in the Württemberg district a third bed&nbsp;separates the Rhaetic and Lias, and constitutes the well-known&nbsp;manure bed of Bebenhausen. In these beds are found the&nbsp;bones of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosaurus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pliosaurus,</span><span class="font0"> anticipating their great&nbsp;development in the Lias, while the remains of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Belodon</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mystriosuchus</span><span class="font0"> serve to link this epoch with Triassic stego-cephalian reptiles. Several coleopterous insects have been&nbsp;found in the same beds, but the most interesting feature of&nbsp;the bone-bed fauna is the first appearance in the northern&nbsp;hemisphere of true mammals: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Microlestes</span><span class="font0"> in England and&nbsp;Württemberg, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Triglyphus</span><span class="font0"> in Württemberg, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dromatherium</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Microconodon</span><span class="font0"> in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In England the Rhaetic formation occurs as a thin but constant series of beds at the base of the Lias and above the Keuper marls.&nbsp;The upper part, often called the “ White Lias,” is a series of thin-bedded shales, limestone and marls, i to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2$</span><span class="font1"> ft. thick; th.e lower&nbsp;portion consists mainly of dark shales, sometimes with very perfect&nbsp;lamination— “paper shales.” Below there are beds of grey and&nbsp;“ tea-green ” mans which are now usually regarded as the topmost&nbsp;Keuper beds, but they have often been included in the Rhaetic&nbsp;formation (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Keuper).</span><span class="font1"> The best exposures in Britain are those&nbsp;between Penarth Head and Cavcrnock Point, Aust Cliff and Garden&nbsp;Cliff near Westbury-on-Severn, and Wainlode Cliff between Tewkesbury and Gloucester. From their excellent development near&nbsp;Penarth the Rhaetic beds have long been known in England as the&nbsp;Penarth Beds (H. W. Bristow, 1864). The more prominent beds&nbsp;in the White Lias of the west of England and Glamorganshire are&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Estheria</span><span class="font1"> beds and the insect limestone or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudomonotis-bvA,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and on both of these horizons the limestone may assume the peculiar&nbsp;characters of landscape marble, sometimes called Cotham marble,&nbsp;from Cotham House near Bristol. A hard fine-grained limestone,&nbsp;known locally as the Sun-bed, occurs at the top of the series near&nbsp;Bath and Radstock; at Street, Wedmore and south of the Mendips&nbsp;generally it is called Jew stone. Wedmore stone is a tough, shelly&nbsp;and sandy limestone in.the black shales at Wedmore, near Wells;&nbsp;it is employed in the neighbourhood as a building stone. North of&nbsp;Somersetshire the White Lias Ispoorlyrepresented; in Glamorganshire it appears between Cardiff and Pyle, west of Bridgend and at&nbsp;Sutton and Southerndown. Rhaetic beds have been traced at&nbsp;Market Drayton, Salop; near Audlem, Cheshire; Rugby and&nbsp;Stratford-on-Avon . in Warwickshire ; Wigston in Leicestershire ;&nbsp;Needham Forest in Staffordshire, and in Nottinghamshire and&nbsp;Yorkshire as far as the coast. They have not yet been proved&nbsp;beneath the Lias of Cumberland. Rfiaetic fossils have been found&nbsp;in great numbers in fissures in the Carboniferous limestone of the&nbsp;Mendips. On the western side of Scotland Rhaetic rocks occur at&nbsp;Appleeross, Ardnamurchan, Morven, Mull, Raasay and Skye. In&nbsp;Sutherlandshire sandstone and conglomerate and large transported&nbsp;masses occur; one of them, at Linksfield, carries a bone bed. Here&nbsp;the black shales of the English type fail; sandstones with coaly&nbsp;layers and yellowish-grey crystalline and oolitic limestones take&nbsp;their place. In Antrim a small outcrop of black shales with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avicula&nbsp;contorta</span><span class="font1"> occurs near Port Rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the European continent the Rhaetic rocks are most thickly developed in the Alpine regions; and, as in the case of the older&nbsp;Triassiç formations, calcareous and dolomitic strata predominate&nbsp;here and in the Mediterranean province. In the Alpine district&nbsp;the main divisions are the Rhaetic Dachstein limestone and the&nbsp;Kossener beds; shales, marls and limestones. In tile northern&nbsp;tract the following subdivisions have been recognized in descending&nbsp;order: beds with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Choristeceros Marscki;</span><span class="font1"> Starhem passage beds;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rkynckonella Assicostata</span><span class="font1"> beds; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Litkodendron</span><span class="font1"> limestone; beds with&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Terebratula gregaria;</span><span class="font1"> beds with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avicuta contorta;</span><span class="font1"> “ Platten Kalk ”&nbsp;with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rkynckonella alpina.</span><span class="font1"> In the southern tract the subdivisions&nbsp;are: Conchodus dolomite </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Conckodus Infraliassicus=Lycodius&nbsp;cor.), Litkodendron</span><span class="font1"> limestone, Azzarola beds, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contorta</span><span class="font1"> marls,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Plattenkalk.” Much limestone is of the “ reef ” type. In Germany the rocks are mainly fine, clean yellow sands, suggesting&nbsp;littoral or dune conditions, with bituminous clays and marls. The&nbsp;formation is often missing in south-west Germany. Similar beds&nbsp;occur in Lorraine and Luxembourg (grès de Vic, grès de Kédange, grès&nbsp;de Mortinsart). ln Cotentin are dolomitic sandstones and marl;&nbsp;round the central plateau of France the rocks are coarse sands, *&nbsp;arkoses, and conglomerates; while in the south of France the sandy&nbsp;and calcareous facies occur intermixed. In Spain limestones and&nbsp;dolomites occur up to 100 metres in thickness; in Portugal sandy&nbsp;beds recur. The Rhaetic of Scania, south Sweden, consists, mainly of&nbsp;sandstone and shales with beds of coal up to one metre thick. Only&nbsp;the upper beds contain marine fossils; the bulk of the formation is&nbsp;of lacustrine or estuarine origin, with j&gt;lant remains and insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In ltaly the formation is well developed in the north and at Rotzo, Spezzia and Carrara; and yields the famous statuary marble and&nbsp;the black variety known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">portor.</span><span class="font1"> Rhaetic beds fiave been recognized in Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, in the Balkan Peninsula and&nbsp;Greece; in Asia<sub>x</sub>Minor, Afghanistan, Turkistan, Persia, Siberia and ·&nbsp;India (limestones and dolomites of Niti and the Mafiaveda beds,&nbsp;sandstones and conglomerates, nearly 10,000 feet thick in Satpura);&nbsp;in China, Japan and Tongking (with coal beds). In Australasia&nbsp;the Wianamatta beds of New South Wales, the Bellarine beds of&nbsp;Victoria, the Ipswich and Tivoli beds of Queensland, and the&nbsp;Jerusalem beds of Tasmania, and beds on a similar horizon in New-Zealand, have been regarded as equivalents of the Rhaetic. In&nbsp;Africa the Stormberg beds of the Karoo series and the Molteno beds</span></p>
