                    style="font-style:italic;">Comitatus</span><span class="font1"> had developed or
                    degenerated into the&nbsp;thegnhood, and among the most eminent and powerful
                    of&nbsp;the king’s thegns, were his dishthegn, his bowerthegn, and&nbsp;his
                    horsethegn or staller. In Normandy at the time of&nbsp;the Conquest a similar
                    arrangement, imitated from the&nbsp;French court, had long been established, and
                    the Norman&nbsp;dukes, like their overlords the kings of France, had
                    their&nbsp;seneschal or steward, their chamberlain, and their constable. After
                    the Conquest the ducal household of&nbsp;Normandy was reproduced in the royal
                    household of&nbsp;England ; and since, in obedience to the spirit of
                    feudalism,&nbsp;the great offices of the first had been made hereditary,
                    the&nbsp;great offices of the second were made hereditary also, and&nbsp;were
                    thenceforth held by the grantees and their descendants as grand-serjeanties of
                    the crown. The consequence&nbsp;was that they passed out of immediate relation
                    to the&nbsp;practical conduct of affairs either in both state and court&nbsp;or
                    in the one or the other of them. The steward and&nbsp;chamberlain of England
                    were superseded in their political&nbsp;functions by the justiciar and treasurer
                    of England, and&nbsp;in their domestic functions by the steward and chamber-lain
                    of the household. The marshal of England took the&nbsp;place of the constable of
                    England in the royal palace, and&nbsp;was associated with him in the command of
                    the royal&nbsp;armies. In due course, however, the marshalship as well&nbsp;as
                    the constableship became hereditary, and, although the&nbsp;constable and
                    marshal of England retained their military&nbsp;authority until a comparatively
                    late period, the duties&nbsp;they had successively performed about the palace
                    had&nbsp;been long before transferred to the master of the horse.&nbsp;Under
                    these circumstances the holders of the original&nbsp;great offices of state and
                    the household ceased to attend&nbsp;the court except on occasions of
                    extraordinary ceremony,&nbsp;and their representatives either by inheritance or
                    by special&nbsp;appointment have ever since continued to appear at coronations
                    and some other public solemnities, such as the opening of the parliament or
                    trials by the House of Lords.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The materials available for a history of the royal household are
                    somewhat scanty and obscure. The earliest record relating to it is of the reign
                    of Henry II., and is&nbsp;contained in the </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Blaxk Book of the Exchequer.</span><span
                    class="font1"> It enumerates the various inmates of the king’s palace and
                    the&nbsp;daily allowances made to them at the period at which&nbsp;it was
                    compiled. Hence it affords valuable evidence of&nbsp;the antiquity and relative
                    importance of the court offices&nbsp;to which it refers, notwithstanding that it
                    is silent as to&nbsp;the functions and formal subordination of the persons
                    who&nbsp;filled them.@@<sup>2</sup> In addition to this record we have a
                    series&nbsp;of far later, but for the most part equally meagre, documents
                    bearing more or less directly on the constitution of&nbsp;the royal household,
                    and extending, with long intervals,&nbsp;from the reign of Edward III. to the
                    reign of William and&nbsp;Mary.@@<sup>3</sup> Among them, however, are what are
                    known as the</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Black Book of the
                    Household</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1"

                    >compiled the first in the reign of Edward IV. and the second&nbsp;in the reign
                    of Henry VIlI., from which a good deal of&nbsp;detailed information may be
                    gathered concerning the&nbsp;arrangements of the court in the 15th and lGth
                    centuries.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >Statutes of Eltham</span><span class="font1"> were meant for the practical
                    guidance merely of those who were responsible for the good&nbsp;order and the
                    sufficient supply of the sovereign’s household&nbsp;at the time they were
                    issued. But the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Black Book
                    of the&nbsp;Household,</span><span class="font1"> besides being a sort of
                    treatise on princely magnificence generally, professes to be based on the
                    regulations&nbsp;established for the governance of the court by Edward
                    III.,&nbsp;who, it affirms, was “ the first setter of certeynties among&nbsp;his
                    domesticall meyne, upon a grounded rule ” and whose&nbsp;palace it describes as
                    “ the house of very policie and flowre&nbsp;of England ; ” and it may therefore
                    possibly, and even&nbsp;probably, take us back to a period much more remote
                    than&nbsp;that at which it was actually put together.@@<sup>4</sup> Various
                    orders,&nbsp;returns, and accounts of the reigns of Elizabeth, James
                    I.,&nbsp;Charles I., Charles IT., and William and Mary throw considerable light
                    on the organization of particular sections&nbsp;of the royal household in times
                    nearer to our own.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Moreover, there were several parliamentary
                    inquiries into&nbsp;the expenses of the royal household in connexion with
                    the&nbsp;settlement or reform of the civil list during the reigns of&nbsp;George
                    III., George IV., and William IV.@@<sup>6</sup> But they add&nbsp;little or
                    nothing to our knowledge of the subject in what&nbsp;was then its historical as
                    distinguished from its contemporary aspects. So much, indeed, is this the case
                    that, on&nbsp;the accession of Queen Victoria, Chamberlayne’s </span><span
                    class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Present&nbsp;State of
                    England,</span><span class="font1"> which contains a catalogue of the
                    officials&nbsp;at the court of Queen Anne, was described by Lord&nbsp;Melbourne
                    the prime minister as the “ only authority ”&nbsp;which the advisers of the
                    crown could find for their&nbsp;assistance in determining the appropriate
                    constitution and&nbsp;dimensions of the domestic establishment of a
                        queen&nbsp;regnant.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">In its main outlines the existing organization of the royal
                    household is essentially the same as it was under&nbsp;the Tudors or the
                    Plantagenets. It is now, as it was then,&nbsp;divided into three principal
                    departments, at the head of&nbsp;which are severally the lord steward, the lord
                    chamber-lain, and the master of the horse, and the respective provinces of which
                    may be generally described as “ below&nbsp;stairs,” “above stairs,” and “out of
                    doors.” But at&nbsp;present, the sovereign being a queen, the royal
                    household&nbsp;is in some other respects rather differently arranged
                    from&nbsp;what it would be if there were a king and a queen consort.&nbsp;λVhen
