<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir James Denham</hi> (1712-1780), <hi rend="smallcaps">Bart.,</hi> author of An <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy,</hi> vol. xix. p. 365), was the only son of Sir James Steuart, solicitor-general for Scotland under Queen Anne and George I., and was born at Edinburgh on October 21, 1712. After passing through the university of Edinburgh he was admitted to the Scottish bar at the age of twenty-four. He then spent some years on the Continent, and while in Rome entered into relations with the Pretender. He was in Edinburgh in 1745, and so compromised himself that after the battle of Culloden he found it necessary to return to the Continent, where he remained until 1763. It was not indeed until 1771 he was fully pardoned for any complicity he may have had in the rebellion. He died at his family seat, Coltness, in Lanarkshire, on November 26, 1780.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Works, Political, Metaphysical, and Chronological, of the late Sir James Steuart of Coltness, Bark, now first collected, with Anecdotes of the Author, by his Son, General Sir James Denham Steuart,</hi> were published in 6 vols. 8vo in 1805.
