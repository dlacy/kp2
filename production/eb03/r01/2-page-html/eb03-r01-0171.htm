<p><span class="font1">RE IIMO, the ancient </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rhitymn'm</span><span class="font1"> of Stephen the geographer, and called by Ptolemy </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rhiiymna,</span><span class="font1"> is a fine&nbsp;city, lying at one end of a rich and fertile plain, on the&nbsp;north coaſt of the iſland of Candia. It is but a ſmall&nbsp;place, containing ſcarce 6000 inhabitants ; but it is a bi-ſhop’s ſee, and the harbour is defended by a citadel,&nbsp;where a baſhaw reſides. It was taken by the Turks in&nbsp;1647, and has been in their hands ever ſince. It is about&nbsp;45 miles from Candia. E. Long. 24. 45. N.Lat. 35.22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The citadel, which ſtands on a rock jutting out into the ſea, would be ſufficient for the defence of the city,&nbsp;were it not ſituated at the foot of an high hill, from&nbsp;which it might be cannonaded with great advantage.&nbsp;The harbour is now almoſt ſilled with ſand, and is no&nbsp;longer acceſſible to ſhipping ; nor do the Turks in any&nbsp;meaſure oppυfe the ravages of time, but behold with a&nbsp;careleſs eye the moſt valuable works in a ſtate of ruin.&nbsp;The trench had formerly a vice-conſul at Retimo, to&nbsp;which ſhips uied to repair ſor cargoes of oil ; but they&nbsp;haye been long unable to get into the harbour : to repair which, however, and to revive the commerce of&nbsp;Retimo, would be a moſt uſeful attempt. The plains&nbsp;around the city abound in a variety of productions.&nbsp;Great quantities of oil, cotton, ſaffron, and wax, are&nbsp;produced here ; and they would be produced in ſtill&nbsp;greater quantities if the inhabitants could export their&nbsp;commodities. The gardens oſ Retimo bear the beſt&nbsp;fruits in the iſland ; excellent pomegranates, almonds,&nbsp;piſtacho nuts, and oranges. The apricot-tree, bearing&nbsp;the michmich, the juice of which is ſo delicious, and its&nbsp;flavour ſo exquiiite, is found here. It is a kind of&nbsp;early peach, but ſmaller and more juicy than thofe oſ&nbsp;France,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RETIRADE, ill fortification, a kind of retrenchment made in the body of a baſtion, or other work, which is to be diſputed, inch by inch, after the defences&nbsp;are diſmantled. It uſually confiſts of two faces, which&nbsp;make a re-entering angle, when a breach is made in&nbsp;a baſtion, the enemy may alſo make a retirade or new&nbsp;fortification behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RE IIREMENT, means a private way of life or a fecret habitation. “ Few (lays an elegant writer) are&nbsp;able to bear ſolitude ; and though retirement is the of-tenſible object of the greater part, yet, when they are&nbsp;enabled by ſucceſs to retire, they feel themſelves unhappy. Peculiar powers and elegance of mind are neceffary to enable us to draw all our reſources from our-felves. In a remote and folitary village the mind muſt&nbsp;be internally active in a great degree, or it will be mi-ferable for want of employment. But in great and&nbsp;populous cities, even while it is paſſive, it will be con-ſtantly amufed. It is impoffible to walk the ſtreets&nbsp;without finding the attention powerfully folicited on&nbsp;every fide. . No exertion is neceffary. objects pour&nbsp;themfelves into the fenfes, and it would be difficult to&nbsp;prevent their admittance. But, in, retirement, there&nbsp;wuſt be a ſpirit of philoſophy and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a ſtore </span><span class="font1">of learning,&nbsp;or elfe the fancied feenes of bliſs will vaniſli like the </span><span class="font0">co</span><span class="font1">lours of the rainbow. Poor Cowley might be laid to&nbsp;be melancholy mad. He languiſhed ſor ſohtude, and&nbsp;wiſhed to hide himfelf in the wilds of America. But,&nbsp;alas ! he was not able to ſupport the ſolitude of a coun-try village within a few miles of the metropolis !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ with a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few' faithful and good-humoured friends, with a well-felect-ed collection of elegant books, and with a competency,&nbsp;one may enjoy comforts even in the deferted village,'&nbsp;which the city, with all its diverfions, cannot fupply.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RETORT, in chemiſtry, an oblong or globular vef-∙ fel with its neck bent, proper for diſtillation. See Chemistry, n<sup>o</sup> 576.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the fifth volume of the Tranfactions of the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, p. 96. we find a paper containing a method for preventing ſtone&nbsp;retorts from breaking ; or flopping them when cracked, during any chemical operation, without lofing any&nbsp;oſ the contained ſubject. &quot; I have always found it neceffary (fays the writer) to uſe a previous coating for&nbsp;filling up the interftices of the earth or ſtone, which is&nbsp;made by diffolving two ounces of borax in a pint of&nbsp;boiling water, and adding to the folution as much flaked lime as will make it into </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">thin paſte ; this, with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">common painter’s bruſh, may be ſpread over feveral retorts, which when dry are then ready for the proper&nbsp;preſerving coating. The intention of this firſt coating&nbsp;is, that the ſubſtances thus ſpread over, readily vitrifv-ing in the fire, prevent any of the diſtilling matters from&nbsp;pervading the retort, but does in nowiſe prevent it from&nbsp;cracking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; whenever I want to afe any of the above coated retorts ; after I have charged them with the ſubſtance&nbsp;to be diſtilled, I prepare a thin paſte, made with common linfeed oil and flaked lime well mixed, and perfect-ly plaſtic, that it may be eaſily ſpread : with this let&nbsp;the retorts be covered all over except that part of the&nbsp;neck which is to be inferted into the receiver ; this is&nbsp;readily done with a painter’s bruſh : the coating will&nbsp;be ſuſſiciently dry in a day or two, and they will then&nbsp;be ſit for ufe. with this coating I have for feveral&nbsp;years worked my ſtone retorts, without any danger of&nbsp;their breaking, and have frequently uſed the fame retort four or live times ; obſervſhg particularly to coat ■&nbsp;it over with the laſt mentioned compoſition every time ’&nbsp;it is charged with freſh materials: Before I made uſe&nbsp;oſ this expedient, it was au even chance, in conducting&nbsp;operations in ſtone and earthen retorts,, whether they '&nbsp;did not crack every time ; by which means great loſs&nbsp;has been ſuſtained. Iſ at any time during the opera-tion the retorts ſhould crack, ſpread fame oſ the oil&nbsp;compoſition thick on the part, and fprinkle feme pow-der of ſiacked lime on it, and it immediately ſtops the&nbsp;ſiffure, and prevents any of the diſtilling matter from&nbsp;pervading ; even that fubtile penetrating ſubſtance the&nbsp;felid phoſphorus will not penetrate through it. It may&nbsp;be applied without any danger, even when the retort is&nbsp;red hot ; and when it is made a little ſtiffer, is more&nbsp;proper for luting veffels than any other I ever have&nbsp;tried ; becaufe if properly mixed it will never crack,&nbsp;nor will it indurate ſo as to endanger the breaking the&nbsp;necks oſ the veffels when taken off.”</span></p>
