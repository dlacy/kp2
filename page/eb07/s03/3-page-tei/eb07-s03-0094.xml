It contains mines, which yield a small quantity of silver. There are large lakes abounding with fish, and the natives have an herb from which they extract brandy. There are only forty-four male inhabitants, who pay tribute to Russia. It is ten miles south from Kamtschatka.</p><p>SHOVEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sib Cloudesly,</hi> a distinguished British admiral, was born about the year 1650, of parents in the lower rank of life. He was first put apprentice to a shoemaker; but disliking this profession, he a few years afterwards abandoned it, and went to sea. He was at first a cabin-boy with Sir Christopher Mynns, but having applied to the study of navigation with indefatigable industry, his skill as a seaman soon raised him above that station.</p><p>The corsairs of Tripoli having committed great outrages on the English in the Mediterranean, Sir John Narborough was sent in 1764 to reduce them to reason. As he had received orders to try the effects of negotiation before he proceeded to hostilities, he sent Mr. Shovel, who was at that time a lieutenant in his fleet, to demand satisfaction. The dey treated him with a great deal of disrespect, and sent him back without an answer. Sir John dispatched him a second time, with orders to remark particularly the situation of things on shore. The behaviour of the dey was worse than ever, and upon Mr. Shovel’s return, he informed Sir John that it would perhaps be possible, notwithstanding their fortifications, to burn all the ships in the harbour. The boats were accordingly manned, and the command of them given to Lieutenant Shovel, who seized the guard-ship, and burned four others, without losing a man. This action so terrified the Tripolins, that they sued for peace. Sir John Narborough gave so favourable an account of this exploit, that Mr. Shovel was soon afterwards made captain of the Sapphire, a fifth-rate ship.</p><p>In the battle of Bantry-Bay, after the Revolution, he commanded the Edgar, and, for his gallant behaviour in that action, was soon afterwards knighted by King Williaru. Next year he was employed in transporting an army into Ireland ; a service which he performed with so much diligence and dexterity, that the king raised him to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and delivered his commission with his own hands. Soon afterwards he was made rear- admiral of the red, and shared the glory of the victory at La Hogue. In 1694 he bombarded Dunkirk. In 1703 he commanded the grand fleet in the Mediterranean, and did every thing in his power to assist the Protestants who were in arms in the Cevennes.</p><p>Soon after the battle of Malaga, he was presented by Prince George to Queen Anne, who received him graciously, and next year employed him as commander-in-chief. In 1705 he commanded the fleet, together with the Earl of Peterborough and Monmouth, which was sent into the Mediterranean ; and it was owing to him chiefly that Barcelona was taken. After an unsuccessful attempt upon Toulon, he sailed for Gibraltar, and from thence homewards with a part of the fleet. On the 22d of October, at night, his ship, with three others, was cast away on the rocks of Scilly ; and all on board perished. His body was found on the island of Scilly, by some fishermen, who stripped it of a valuable ring, and afterwards buried it. Mr. Paxton, the purser of the Arundel, hearing of this, found out the fellows, and obliged them to discover where they had buried the body. He carried it on board his own ship to Portsmouth, whence it was conveyed to London, and interred with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey. A monument was afterwards erected to his memory by the direction of the queen. He married the widow of his patron, Sir John Narborough, by whom he left two daughters.</p><p>SHOUT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Clamour,</hi> in antiquity, was frequently used on ecclesiastical, civil, and military occasions, as a sign of approbation, and sometimes of indignation. Thus as Cicero, in an assembly of the people, was exposing the arrogance of Antony, who had had the impudence to cause himself to be inscribed the patron of the Romans, the people on hearing this raised a shout to show their indignation. In the ancientmilitary discipline, shouts were used, first, upon occasion of the general’s making a speech or harangue to the army from his tribunal. This they did in token of their approving what had been proposed. Secondly, they were used before an engagement, in order to encourage and spirit their own men, and fill the enemy with dread. This was a practice of great antiquity ; but, besides, it wants not the authority of reason to support it ; for as mankind are endowed with two senses, hearing and seeing, by which fear is raised in the mind, it may be proper to make use of the ear as well as the eye for that purpose. Shouts were also raised in the ancient theatre, when what was acted pleased the spectators. It was usual for those present at the burning of the dead to raise a great shout, and call the dead person by his name, before they set fire to the pile.</p><p>SHREWSBURY, a town in the liberty of the same name, and the capital of the county of Shropshire, 156 miles from London. It is situated on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> peninsula formed by the river Severn, which nearly surrounds it, and over which are two stone bridges. It comprehends three parishes, with a church to each, which were formerly collegiate, namely, St. Alkmands, St. Marys, and St. Chads. The town was in ancient times well fortified, and had a strong castle towards the north, a part of which still remains, and the keep has been converted into a garden. There is a free grammar school, at present in high repute, for communicating classical instruction, which possesses some valuable exhibitions at Cambridge. It is well endowed, and has a good library and neat chapel connected with it. There is a county hall, a jail, two bridewells, and a house of industry. The streets are narrow, and some of them rather steep, and the greater part of the houses are of ancient construction and fashion. It is a borough, and the corporation has extensive judicial power within the liberty, though it is now commonly transferred to the assizes for the county, which are held here. Shrewsbury has some trade by the river Severn, and some by a canal, which connects it with Ellesmere, and other parts of the kingdom. The principal manufactory is that of flannels, many of which, indeed, are woven in Montgomeryshire, and brought to Shrewsbury to be finished, but many are made within the town, and of late years machinery has been extended for that purpose. There are likewise some linens, and some coarse woollen cloths made. The country around is highly fertile, and the two markets, on Wednesday and Saturday, are most abundantly supplied. The town returns two members to parliament, and gives the title of earl to the ancient family of Talbot. The population was, in 1801, 14,739; in 1811, 16,606; in 1821, 19,854; and in 1831, 21,227.</p><p>SHUGA WULPOOR, a large town of Hindustan, in the province of Malwah, situatcd on the north-east bank of the river Jummary. It consists of a fortified town or citadel, and extensive suburbs, in which are some good houses, and an extensive bazaar. It is a considerable market for shipped muslins, 65 miles E.N.E. from Oojain. Long. 76. 45. E. Lat. 23. 24. N.</p><p>SHUKASKU, a large village of Irak in Arabia, on the western bank of the Euphrates.
