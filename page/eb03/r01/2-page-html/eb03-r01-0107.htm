<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font1">the minds of his followers. Paradiſe was to abound with rivers, trees, fruits, and ſhady groves ; wine which&nbsp;would not intoxicate was to be there plentifully ſerved&nbsp;up to believers ; the inhabitants of that happy region were&nbsp;all to enjoy perpetual youth ; and their powers of enjoyment were to be enlarged and invigorated, in order&nbsp;that ſo many fine things might not be thrown away&nbsp;upon them. &quot; Inſtead of inſpiring the bleffed inhabitants of paradiſe with a liberal taſte for harmony and&nbsp;fcience, converſation,and friendſhip (ſays Mr Gibbon),&nbsp;Mahomet idly celebrates tbe pearls and diamonds, the&nbsp;robes of ſilk, palaces of marble, diſhes of gold, rich&nbsp;wines, artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the&nbsp;whole train of ſenſual luxury.—Seventy two houris,&nbsp;or black-eyed girls of refplendent beauty, blooming&nbsp;youth, virgin purity, and exquifite ſenfibility, will be&nbsp;created for the uſe of the meaneſt believer ; a moment&nbsp;of pleaſure will be prolonged for ι ooo years, and his&nbsp;faculties will be increaſed ioo fold, to render him&nbsp;worthy of his felicity.” It muſt be acknowledged&nbsp;that he allows believers other more refined enjoyments&nbsp;than theſe ; thus they are to ſee the face of God morn-ing and evening ; a pleaſure which is far to exceed all&nbsp;the other pleaſures of paradiſe. The following is his&nbsp;deſcription of the puniſhments of hell : The wicked are&nbsp;there to drink nothing but boiling ſtinking water ;&nbsp;breathe nothing but hot winds ; dwell for ever in continual burning fire and fmoke ; eat nothing but briars&nbsp;and thorns, and the fruit of a tree that rifeth out of&nbsp;the bottom of hell, whoſe branches reſemble the heads&nbsp;of devils, and whole fruits fiιall be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1">their bellies like&nbsp;burning pitch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All that we can conclude from a general view of the religion of Mahomet, from confidering the character&nbsp;oſ the prophet, er from reviewing the hiſtory of the&nbsp;nations among whom it has been eſtabliſhed, is, that&nbsp;it is one tiffue of abſurdities, with a few truths, however, and valuable precepts incongruouſly intermixed ;&nbsp;that a great part of it is unfavourable to virtuous manners, to wiſe and equal laws, and to the progreſs of&nbsp;knowledge and refinement. It often inculcates in a&nbsp;direct manner ſentiments that are highly immoral ; it&nbsp;fubſtitutes trifling, ſuperſtitious obfervaπces in the room&nbsp;of genuine piety and moral virtue; and it gives ſuch&nbsp;views of futurity as render purity of heart no neceffary&nbsp;qualification for feeing God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Surely, therefore, even the deiſt, who rejects all but natural religion, would not hefitate to prefer Chriſtianity, and even Judaiſm, to the religion of Mahomet.&nbsp;Judaiſm, calculated for a peculiar people, was undoubtedly much more fublime and much more happily framed to render that people virtuous and·happy in the·circumſtances in which they were placed; and Chriſtianity&nbsp;we find to be an univerſal religion, ſuited to all circumſtances and to all the ſtages of ſociety, and acting,&nbsp;wherever it is received, with more or lets'force to the&nbsp;ſupport of civil order, virtuous manners, improvement&nbsp;of arts, and the advancement· of fctcnce. However,&nbsp;as Mahometaniſm forms in feme meaſure a regular ſyſtem, as it has borrowed many of the precepts and doctrines of Judaiſm and Chriſtianity, not indeed without&nbsp;corrupting and degrading them; and- as it has contributed conſiderably to the ſupport of civil government,&nbsp;although ⅛ a very imperfect form, in thoſe countries&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in which ſt has obtained an eſtabliſhment ; </span><span class="font1">for </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">all theſe</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">reafons we canaot but give it the preference to the ſu-perſtitions of Paganiſm.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The whole reſult of our inquiries under this article, therefore, is, I. That as man, by the conſtitution of&nbsp;his mind, is naturally fitted for acquiring certain no-tions concerning the exiſtence of invifible, ſuperior be-ings, and their influence on human life ; ſo the reli-gious ideas which we find to have in all ages of the&nbsp;world, and in all the different ſtages of the progteſs of&nbsp;ſociety, prevailed among mankind, appear to have originated partly from the natural exertions of the human&nbsp;imagination, underſtanding, and paſſions, in various cir- ~&nbsp;cumſtances, and partly from ſupernatural revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">That though religious opinions, together with the&nbsp;moral precepts, and the rites of worſhip connected with&nbsp;them, may appear to have been in numerous inſtances&nbsp;injurious to the virtue and happinefs of ſociety ; yet<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>as they have often contributed to lead the mind to form&nbsp;moral diſtinctions, when it would otherwiſe in all probability have been an entire ſtranger to ſuch diſtinctions ; and as they lrave always contributed in an effential manner to the eſtabliſhment and the ſupport of&nbsp;civil government—it muſt therefore be acknowledged&nbsp;that they have always, even in their humbleſt ſtate, ∙&nbsp;been more beneficial than hurtful to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when the different ſyſtems of religion that&nbsp;have prevailed in the world are comparatively viewed&nbsp;with reſpect to their influence on the welfare of ſociety,&nbsp;we find reaſon to prefer the polytheiſin of the Greeks&nbsp;and Romans to the ruder, wilder, religious ideas and&nbsp;ceremonies that have prevailed among ſavages ; Mahometaniſm, perhaps in ſorne reſpects, to the pol⅛theifm of&nbsp;the Greeks and Romans ; Judaiſin however to Mahometaniſm ; and Chriſtianity to all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RELIGIOUS, in a general ſenſe, ſomething that relates to religion.—we ſay, a religious life, religious&nbsp;ſociety, &amp;c.—Churches and church-yards^are religious&nbsp;places.—A religious war is alſo called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">croifade.</span><span class="font1"> See ’&nbsp;Croisade.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REMBR ANDT (Van Rhin), a Flemiſh painter and engraver of great eminence, was born in 16c6, in a&nbsp;mill upon the banks of the Rhine, from whence he derived his name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Van Rhin.</span><span class="font1"> This maſter was born -with a creative- genius, which never attained perfection. It was ſaid of him, that he&quot; would have invent&quot;&nbsp;ed painting, if he had not found it already difcovered,&nbsp;without ſtudy, without the aſſiſtance of any maſter,&nbsp;but by his- own inſtinctj he formed rules, and a certain practical method for colouring ; and the mixture&nbsp;produced the defιgκed effect. Nature is not ſet off to&nbsp;the greateſt advantage in his pictures; but there is ſuch.&nbsp;a ſtriking truth and ſimplicity in them,, that his heads,&nbsp;particularly his - portraits, ∙. ſeem animated, and rifing&nbsp;from the canvas.
