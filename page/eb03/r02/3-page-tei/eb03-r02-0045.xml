The action of gravity; and, 2. The mobility of the particles, which makes them aſſume a level in confined veſſels, or determines them to move to that fide where there is a defect of preſſure. When the ſur-face is level, every particle is at reſt, being equally preſ-ſed in all directions ; but if the ſurface 13 not level, not only does a particle on the very ſurface tend by its own weight towards the lower ſide, as a body would Aide along an inclined plane, but there is a force, external to itſelf, ariſing from a ſuperiority of preſſure on the upper -end of the ſurface, which puſhes this ſuperficial particle towards the lower end ; and this is not peculiar to the ſuperficial particles, but affects every particle within the maſs of water. In the veſſel ACHE fſig. 6. ), containing water with an inclined ſurface AE, if <hi rend="italic">we </hi>ſuppoſe all frozen but the extreme columns AKHB, FGLE, and a connecting portion HKCDLG, it is evident, from hydroſtatical laws, that the water on this connecting part will be puſhed in the direction CD ; and if the frozen maſs BHGF were moveable, it would alſo be puſhed along. Giving it fluidity will make no change in this reſpect ; and it is indifferent what is the ſituation and ſhape of the connecting column or columns. The propelling force (MNF being horizontal) is the weight of the column AMNB. The ſame thing will obtain wherever we ſelect the vertical columns. There will always be a force tending to puſh every particle of water in the direction of the declivity. The conſequence will be, that the water will link at one end and riſe at the other, and its ſurface will reſt in the horizontal poſition <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  O <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>  cutting the former in its middle O. This cannot be unleſs there be not only a motion of perpendicular deſcent and aſcent of the vertical columns, but alſo a real motion of tranſlation from K towards L. It perhaps exceeds our mathematical ſlcill to tell what will be the motion of each particle. Newton did not attempt it in his inveſtigation of the motion of waves, nor is it at all neceſſary here. We may, however, acquire a very diſtinct notion of its general effect. Let OPQJre a vertical plane paſſing through the middle point O. It is evident that every particle in PQ, ſuch f,s P, is preſſed in the direction QD, with a force equal to the weight of a ſingle row of particles, whoſe length is the difference between the columns BH and FG. The force acting on the particle Q_is, in like manner, the weight of a row of particles =AC—ED. Now if OQ<hi rend="sub">j</hi>  OA, OE, be divided in the ſame ratio, ſo that all the figures ACDE, BHGF, &amp;c. may beſimilar, we ſee that the force ariſing ſolely from the declivity, and acting on each particle on the plane is proportional to its depth under the ſurface, and that the row of particles ACQDE, BHPGF, &amp;c. which is to be moved by it, is in the ſame proportion. Hence it un-queſtionably follows, that the accelerating force on each particle of the row is the ſame in all. Therefore the whole plane OQ__ tends to advance forward together with the ſame velocity ; and in the inſtant immediately ſucceeding, all theſe particles would be found again in a vertical plane indefinitely near to OQ; and if we ſum up the forces, we ſhallfind them the ſame as if OQ were the opening of a ſluice, having the water on the ſide of D ſtanding level with O, and the water on the other ſide ſtanding at the height AC. This reſult is extremely different from that of the haſty theory of Gugiielmini. He conſiders each particle in OQ as urged by an accelerating force proportional to its depth, ft is true ; but he makes it <hi rend="italic">equal</hi>  to the weight of the row OP, and never recollects that the greateſt part of it is balanced by an oppoſite preſſure, nor perceives that the force which is not balanced muſt be diſtributed among a row of particles which varies in the ſame proportion with itſelf. When theſe two circumſtances are neglected, the reſult muſt be incompatible with obſer-vation. When the balanced forces are taken into the account of preſſure, it is evident that the ſurface may be ſuppoſed horizontal, and that motion ſhould obtain in this caſe as well as in the caſe of a ſloping ſurface : and indeed this is Guglielmini’s profeſſed theory, and what he highly values himſelf on. He announces this diſcovery of a new principle, which he calls the energy of deep waters, as an important addition to hydraulics. It is owing to this, ſays he. that the great rivers are not ſtagnant at their mouths, where they have no perceptible declivity of ſurface, but, on the contrary, have greater energy and velocity than farther up, where they are ſhallower. This principle is the baſis of his improved theory of rivers, and is infiſted on at great length by all the ſubfequent writers. Buffon, in his theory of the earth, makes much uſe of it. We cannot but wonder that it has been allowed a place in the theory of rivers given in the great <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi>  of Paris, and in an article having the ſignature (O-) of D’Alembert. We have been very anxious to ſhow the falſity of this principle, becauſe we conſider it as a mere ſubterfuge of Gugiielmini, by which he was able to patch up the mathematical theory which he had ſo haſtily taken from Newton or Galileo ; and we think that we have ſecu-rεd our readers from being miſled by it, when we ſhow that this energy muſt be equally operative when the ſurface 16 on a dead level. The abſurdity of this is evident. We ſhall ſee by and by, that deep waters, when in actual motion, have an energy not to be found in ſhallow running waters, by which they are enabled to continue that motion : but this is not a moving principle ; and it will be fully explained, as an immediate reſult of principles, not vaguely conceived and indi- . ſtinctly expreſſed, like this of Gugliélmini, but eaſily un-derſtood, and appreciable with the greateſt preciſion. It is an energy common t-o all great bodies. Although they lofe as much momentum in ſurmounting any ob-ſtacle as ſmall ones, they loſe but a ſmall portion of their velocity.
