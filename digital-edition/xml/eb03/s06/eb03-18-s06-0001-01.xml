 in mechanics, is a ſubject of ſo much importance, that in a nation ſo eminent as this for invention and ingenuity in all ſpecies of manufactures, and in particular ſo diſtinguiſhed for its improvements in machinery of every kind, it is ſomewhat singular that no writer has treated it in the detail which its importance and difficulty demands. The man of ſcience who viſits our great manufactures is delighted with the ingenuity which he obſerves in every part, the innumerable inventions which come even from individual artiſans, and the determined purpoſe of improvement and refinement which he ſees in every workſhop. Every cotton mill appears an academy of mechanical ſcience ; and mechanical invention is ſpreading from theſe fountains over the whole kingdom : But the philoſopher is mortified to see this ardent ſpirit ſo cramped by ignorance of principle, and many of theſe original and brilliant thoughts obſcured and clogged with needleſs and even hurtful additions, and a complication of machinery which checks improvement even by its appearance of ingenuity. There is nothing in which this want of ſcientific education, this ignorance of principle, is ſo frequently obſerved as in the injudicious proportion of the parts of machines and other mechanical ſtructures ; proportions and forms of parts in which the ſtrength and poſition are nowiſe regulated by the ſtrains to which they are expoſed, and where repeated failures have been the only lessons.</p><p>It cannot be otherwiſe. We have no means of inſtruction, except two very ſhort and abſtracted treatiſes of the late Mr Emerſon on the ſtrength of materials. We do not recollect a performance in our language from which our artiſts can get information. Treatiſes written expreſsly on different branches of mechanical arts are totally silent on this, which is the basis and <hi rend="italic">only principle</hi> of their performances. Who would imagine that <hi rend="smallcaps">Price’s British Carpenter,</hi> the work of the firſt reputation in this country, and of which the sole aim is to teach the carpenter to erect solid and durable ſtructures, does not contain one proportion or one reaſon by which one form of a thing can be ſhown to be ſtronger or weaker than another ? We doubt very much if one carpenter in an hundred can give a reaſon to convince his own mind that a joiſt is ſtronger when laid on its edge than when laid on its broad side. We ſpeak in this ſtrong manner in hopes of exciting ſome man of ſcience to publiſh a ſyſtem of inſtruction on this ſubject. The limits of our Work will not admit of a detail : but we think it neceſſary to point out the leading principles, and to give the traces of that ſyſtematic connection by which all the knowledge already poſſeſſed of this ſubject may be brought together and properly arranged. This we ſhall now attempt in as brief a manner as we are able.</p><p>T <hi rend="smallcaps">he</hi> ſtrength of materials ariſes immediately of ultimately from the cohesion of the parts of bodies. Our examination of this property of tangible matter has as yet been very partial and imperfect, and by no means enables us to apply mathematical calculations with preciſion and success. The various modifications of cohesion, in its different appearances of perfect ſoftneſs, plaſticity, ductility, elaſticity, hardneſs, have a mighty influence on the ſtrength of bodies, but are hardly ſuſceptible of meaſurement. Their texture also, whether uniform like glaſs and ductile metals, cryſtallized or granulated like other metals and freeſtone, or fibrous like timber, is a circumſtance no leſs important ; yet even here, although we derive ſome advantage from remarking to which of theſe forms of aggregation a ſubſtance belongs, the aid is but ſmall. All we can do in this want of general principles is to make experiments on every claſs of bodies. Accordingly philoſophers have endeavoured to inſtruct the public in this particular. The Royal Society of London at its very firſt inſtitution made many experiments at their meetings, as may be ſeen in the firſt registers of the Society<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* See Birche's History, and Hooke's Mathematical Collections.</p></note> *. Several individuals have added their experiments. The most numerous collection in detail is by Muſchenbroek, profeſſor of natural philoſophy at Leyden. Part of it was publiſhed by himſelf in his Es <hi rend="italic">ſais de Physique,</hi> in 2 vols 4t0 ; but the full collection is to be found in his Syſtem of Natural Philoſophy, publiſhed after his death by Lulofs, in 3 vols 4to. This was tranſlated from the Low Dutch into French by Sigaud de la Fond, and publiſhed at Paris in 1760, and is a prodigious collection of physical knowledge of all kinds, and may almoſt ſuffice for a library of natural philoſophy. But this collection of experiments on the coheſion of bodies is not of that value which one expects. We preſume that they were carefully made and faithfully narrated ; but they were made on ſuch ſmall ſpecimens that the unavoidable natural inequalities of growth or texture produced irregularities in the reſults which bore too great a proportion to the whole quantities obſerved. We may make the same remark on the experiments of Couplet, Pitot, De la Hire, Du Hamel, and others of the French academy. In ſhort, if we except the experiments of Buffon on the ſtrength of timber, made at the public expence on a large ſcale, there is nothing to be met with from which we can obtain abſolute meaſures which may be employed with confidence ; and there is nothing in the Engliſh language except a ſimple list by Emerſen, which is merely a ſet of affirmations, without any narration of circumſtances, to enable us to judge of the validity oſ his conclusions : but the character of Mr Emerſon, as a man of knowledge and of integrity, gives even to theſe aſſertions a conſiderable value.</p><p>But to make uſe of any experiments, there muſt be employed ſome general principle by which we can generalize their reſults. They will otherwiſe be only narrations of detached facts. We muſt have ſome notion of that intermedium, by the intervention of which an external force applied to one part of a lever, joiſt, or pillar, occaſions a ſtrain on a diſtant part. This can be nothing but the coheſion between the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0008.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0002"/>
parts. It is this connecting force which is brought into action, or, as we more ſhortly expreſs it, excited. This action is modified in every part by the laws of mechanics. It is this action which is what we call the st <hi rend="italic">rength</hi> of that part, and its effect is the ſtrain on the adjoining parts ; and thus it is the same force, differently viewed, that conſtitutes both the ſtrain and the ſtrength. When we conſider it in the light of a resiſtance to fracture, we call it st <hi rend="italic">rength.</hi></p><p>We call every thing a <hi rend="italic">force</hi> which we obſerve to be ever accompanied by a change of motion ; or, more ſtrictly ſpeaking, we infer the preſence and agency of a force wherever we obſerve the ſtate of things in reſpect of motion different from what we know to be the reſult of the action of all the forces which we know to act on the body. Thus when we obſerve a rope prevent a body from falling, we infer a moving force inherent in the rope with as much confidence as when we obſerve it drag the body along the ground. The <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> action of this force is undoubtedly exerted between the immediately adjoining parts of the rope. The immediate effect is the keeping the particles of the rope together. They ought to ſeparate by any external force drawing the ends of the rope contrarywiſe ; and we aſcribe their not doing ſo to a mechanical force really oppoſing this external force. When desired to give it a name, we name it from what we conceive to be its effect, and therefore its characteriſtic, and we call it <hi rend="smallcaps">cohesion.</hi> This is merely a name for the fact ; but it is the same thing in all our denominations. We know nothing of the cauſes but in the effects ; and our name for the cauſe is in fact the name of the effect, which is <hi rend="smallcaps">cohesion.</hi> We mean nothing elſe by gravitation or magnetiſm. What do we mean when we say that Newton underſtood thoroughly the nature of gravitation, of the force of gravitation ; or that Franklin underſtood the nature of the electric force? Nothing but this: Newton conſidered with patient ſagacity the general facts of gravitation, and has deſcribed and claſſed them with the utmoſt preciſion. In like manner, we ſhall understand the nature of coheſion when we have diſcovered with equal generality the laws of coheſion, or general facts which are obſerved in the appearances, and when we have deſcribed and claſſed them with equal accuracy.</p><p>Let us therefore attend to the more ſimple and obvious phenomena of coheſion, and mark with care every circumstance of reſemblance by which they may be claſſed. Let us receive these as the laws of coheſion, characteriſtic of its ſuppoſed cauſe, the force of coheſion. We cannot pretend to enter on this vaſt reſearch. The modifications are innumerable ; and it would require the penetration of more than Newton to detect the circumſtance of similarity amidſt millions of diſcriminating circumſtances.Yet this is the only way of diſcovering which are the primary facts characteriſtic of the force, and which are the modifications. The ſtudy is immenſe, but is by no means desperate; and we entertain great hopes that it will ere long be ſucceſsfully proſecuted : but, in our particular predicament, we must content ourſelves with ſelecting ſuch general laws as seem to give us the moſt immediate information of the circumſtances that muſt be attended to by the mechanician in his constructions, that he may unite ſtrength with simplicity, economy, and energy.</p><p>1st,Then, it is a matter of fact that all bodies are in a certain degree perfectly elaſtic ; that is, when their form or bulk is changed by certain moderate compreſſions or diſtractions, it requires the continuance of the changing force to continue the body in this new ſtate ; and when the force is removed, the body recovers its original form. We limit the aſſertion to <hi rend="italic">certain moderate</hi> changes : For inſtance, take a lead wire of 1/15th of an inch in diameter and ten feet long ; fix one end firmly to the ceiling, and let the wire hang perpendicular; affix to the lower end an index like the hand of a watch ; on ſome ſtand immediately below let there be a circle divided into degrees, with its centre correſponding to the lower point of the wire ; now turn this index twice round, and thus twiſt the wire. When the index is let go, it will turn backwards again, by the wire’s untwiſting itſelf, and make almoſt four revolutions before it ſtops ; after which it twiſts and untwiſts many times, the index going backwards and forwards round the circle, diminiſhing however its arch of twiſt each time, till at last it settles preciſely in its original poſition. This may be repeated for ever. Now, in this motion, every part of tire wire partakes equally of the twiſt. The particles are ſtretched, require force to keep them in their ſtate of extenſion, and recover completely their original relative poſitions. Theſe are all the characters of what the mechanician calls <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> elaſticity. This is a quality quite familiar in many cases ; as in glaſs, tempered ſteel, &amp;c. but was thought incompetent to lead, which is generally conſidered as having little or no elaſticity. But we make the aſſertion in the moſt general terms, with the limitation to moderate derangement of form. We have made the same experiment on a thread of pipe-clay, made by forcing ſoft clay through the ſmall hole of a ſyringe by means of a ſcrew ; and we found it more elaſtic than the lead wire : for a thread of 1/20th of an inch diameter and 7 feet long allowed the index to make two turns, and yet completely recovered its firſt poſition.</p><p><hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> But if we turn the index of the lead wire four times round, and let it go again, it untwiſts again in the same manner, but it makes little more than four turns back again ; and after many oſcillations it finally ſtops in a position almoſt two revolutions removed from its original position. It has now acquired a new arrangement of parts, and this new arrangement is permanent like the former ; and, what is of particular moment, it is perfectly elaſtic. This change is familiarly known by the denomination of a <hi rend="smallcaps">set.</hi> The wire is laid to have <hi rend="smallcaps">taken a set.</hi> When we attend minutely to the procedure of nature in this phenomenon, we find that the particles have as it were ſlid on each other, ſtill cohering, and have taken a new poſition, in which their connecting forces are in equilibrio ; and in this change of relative ſituation, it appears that the connecting forces which maintained the particles in their firſt ſituations were not in equilibrio in ſome poſition intermediate between that of the firſt and that of the laſt form. The force required for changing this firſt form augmented with the change, but only to a certain degree ; and during this proceſs the connecting forces always tended to the recovery of this firſt form. But after the change of mutual poſition has pasſed a certain magnitude, the union has been partly deſtroyed, and the particles have been brought into new ſituations ; ſuch, that the forces which now connect each with its neighbour tend, not to the recovery of the firſt arrangement, but to puſh them farther from it, into a new ſituation, to which they now verge, and require force to prevent them from acquiring. The wire is now in fact again perfectly elaſtic ; that is, the forces which now connect the particles with their new neighbours augment to a certain degree as the derangement from this new poſition augments. This is not reaſoning from any theory. It is narrating facts, on which a theory is to be founded. What we have been juſt now laying is evidently a description of that ſenſible form of tangible matter which we call <hi rend="italic">ductility.</hi> It has every gradation of variety, from the ſoftneſs of butter to the firmneſs of gold. All theſe bodies have ſome elaſticity ; but we say they are not perfectly elaſtic, becauſe they do not completely recover their original form when it has been<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0009.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0003"/>
greatly deranged. The whole gradation may be moſt diſtinctly obſerved in a piece of glaſs or hard ſealing wax. In the ordinary form glass is perhaps the moſt completely elaſtic body that we know, and may be bent till juſt ready to ſnap, and yet completely recovers its firſt form, and takes no ſet whatever ; but when heated to ſuch a degree as juſt to be viſible in the dark, it loſes its brittleneſs, and becomes ſo tough that it cannot be broken by any blow ; but it is no longer elaſtic, takes any ſet, and keeps it. When more heated, it becomes as plaſtic as clay : but in this ſtate is remarkably diſtinguiſhed from clay by a quality which we may call VISCIDITY, which is ſomething like elaſticity, of which clay and other bodies purely plaſtic exhibit no appearance. This is the joint operation of ſtrong adheſion and ſoftneſs. When a rod of perfectly soft glaſs is ſuddenly ſtretched a little, it does not at once take the ſhape which it acquires after ſome little time. It is owing to this, that in taking the impreſſion of a ſeal, if we take off the ſeal while the wax is yet very hot, the ſharpneſs of the impreſſion is destroyed immediately. Each part drawing its neighbour, and each part yielding, the prominent parts are pulled down and blunted, and the ſharp hollows are pulled upwards and alſo blunted. The ſeal muſt be kept on till all has become not only ſtiſſ but hard.</p><p>This viſcidity is to be obſerved in all plaſtic bodies which are homogeneous. It is not obſerved in clay, becauſe it is not homogeneous, but conſiſts of hard particles of the argillaceous earth flicking together by their attraction for water. Something like it might be made of finely powdered glaſs and a clammy fluid ſuch as turpentine. Viscidſty has all degrees of ſoftneſs till it degenerates to ropy fluidity like that of olive oil. Perhaps ſomething of it may be found even in the moſt perfect fluid that we are acquainted with, as we obſerved in the experiments for aſcertaining ſpecific gravity.</p><p>There is in a late volume of the Philoſophical Tranſactions a narration of experiments, by which it appears that the thread of the ſpider is an exception to our firſt general law, and that it is perfectly ductile. It is there aſſerted, that a long thread of goſſamer, furniſhed with an index, takes any poſition whatever ; and that though the index be turned round any number of times (even many hundreds), it has no tendency to recover its firſt form. The thread takes completely any ſet whatever. We have not had an opportunity of repeating this experiment, but we have distinctly obſerved a phenomenon totally inconſistent with it. If a fibre of goſſamer about an inch long be held by the end horizontally, it bends downward in a curve like a ſlender slip of whalebone or a hair. If totally devoid of elaſticity, and perfectly indifferent to any ſet, it would hang down perpendicularly without any curvature.</p><p>When ductility and elaſticity are combined in different proportions, an immenſe variety of ſenſible modes of aggregation may be produced. Some degree of both are probably to be obſerved in all bodies of complex conſtitution ; that is, which conſiſt of particles made up of many different kinds of atoms. Such a conſtitution of a body muſt afford many situations permanent, but eaſily deranged.</p><p>In all theſe changes of disposition which take place among the particles of a ductile body, the particles are at ſuch diſtance that they ſtill cohere. The body may be ſtretched a little ; and on removing the extending force, the body shrinks into its firſt form. It alſo reſiſts moderate compreſſions ; and when the compreſſing force is removed, the body ſwells out again. Now the corpuſcular fact here is, that the particles are acted on by attractions and repulſions, which balance each other when no external force is acting on the body, and which augment as the particles are made, by any external cauſe, to recede from this ſituation of mutual inactivity ; for since force is requiſite to produce either the dilatation or the compreſſion, and to maintain it, we are obliged, by the conſtitution of our minds, to infer that it is oppoſed by a force accompanying or inherent in every particle of dilatable or compreſſible matter ; and as this neceſſity of employing force to produce a change indicates the agency of theſe corpuſcular forces, and marks their kind, according as the tendencies of the particles appear to be toward each other in dilatation, or from each other in compreſſion ; ſo it alſo meaſures the degrees of their intensity. Should it require three times the force to produce a double compreſſion, we muſt reckon the mutual repulſions triple when the compreſſion is doubled ; and ſo in other inſtances. We ſee from all this that the phenomena of coheſion indicate ſome relation between the intenſity of the force of coheſion and the diſtance between the centres of the particles. To diſcover this relation is the great problem in corpuſcular mechaniſm, as it was in the Newtonian inveſtigation of the force of gravitation. Could we diſcover this law of action between the corpuſclcs with the ſame certainty and diſtinctneſs, we might with equal confidence say what will be the reſult of any poſition which we give to the particles of bodies ; but this is beyond our hopes. The law of gravitation is ſo simple that the diſcovery or detection of it amid the variety of celeſtial phenomena required but one ſtep ; and in its own nature its poſſible combinations ſtill do not greatly exceed the powers of human reſearch. One is almoſt diſpoſed to ſay that the Supreme Being has exhibited it to our reaſoning powers as sufficient to employ with ſucceſs our utmoſt efforts, but not ſo abſtruſe as to diſcourage us from the noble attempt. It ſeems to be otherwiſe with reſpect to coheſion. Mathematics informs us, that if it deviates ſenſibly from the law of gravitation, the ſimpleſt combinations will make the joint action of ſeveral particles an almoſt impenetrable myſtery. We muſt therefore content ourſelves, for a long while to come, with a careful obſervation of the ſimpleſt cafes that we can propoſe, and with the diſcovery of ſecondary laws of action, in which many particles combine their influence. In pursuance of this plan, we observe,</p><p>3dly, That whatever is the ſituation of the particles of a body with reſpect to each other, when in a quieſcent ſtate, they are kept in theſe ſituations by the balance of oppoſite forces. This cannot be refuſed, nor can we form to ourſelves any other notion of the ſtate of the particles of a body. Whether we suppoſe the ultimate particles to be of certain magnitudes and ſhapes, touching each other in single points of coheſion ; or whether we (with Boſcovich) conſider them as at a diſtance from each other, and acting on each other by attractions and repulſions—we muſt acknowledge, in the firſt place, that the centres of the particles (by whoſe mutual diſtances we muſt eſtimate the diſtance of the particles) may and do vary their diſtances from each other. What else can we say when we obſerve a body increaſe in length, in breadth, and in thickneſs, by heating it, or when we ſee it diminiſh in all theſe dimenſions by an external compreſſion ? A particle, therefore, ſituated in the midſt of many others, and remaining in that ſituation, muſt be conceived as maintained in it by the mutual balancing of all the forces which connect it with its neighbours. It is like a ball kept in its place by the oppoſite action of two ſprings. This illuſtration merits a more particular application. Suppoſe a number of balls ranged on the table in the angles of equilateral triangles, and that each ball is connected with the six which lie around it by means of an elaſtic wire curled like a cork-screw ; ſuppoſe ſuch another ſtratum of balls above this, and parallel to it, and ſo placed that<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0010.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0004"/>
each ball of the upper ſtratum is perpendicularly over the centre of the equilateral triangle below, and let theſe be connected with the balls of the under ſtratum by similar ſpiral wires. Let there be a third and a fourth, and any number of ſuch ſtrata, all connected in the ſame manner. It is plain that this may extend to any ſize and fill any ſpace. — Now let this aſſemblage of balls be firmly contemplated by the imagination, and be ſuppoſed to ſhrink continually in all its demenſions, till the balls, and their diſtances from each other, and the connecting wires, all vaniſh from the ſight as diſcrete individual objects. All this is very conceivable. It will now appear like a ſolid body, having length, breadth, and thickneſs ; it may be compreſſed, and will again reſume its dimenſions ; it may be ſtretched, and will again ſhrink ; it will move away when ſtruck ; in ſhort, it will not differ in its ſenſible appearance from a ſolid elaſtic body. Now when this body is in a ſtate of compreſſion, for inſtance, it is evident that any one of the balls is at rest, in conſequence of the mutual balancing of the actions of all the ſpiral wires which connect it with thoſe around it. It will greatly conduce to the full underſtanding of all that follows to recur to this illuſtration. The analogy or reſemblance between the effects of this conſtitution of things and the effects of the corpuſcular forces is very great; and wherever it obtains, we may ſafely draw concluſions from what we know would be the condition of the balls in particular circumſtances to what will be the condition of a body of common tangible matter. We ſhall just give one inſtructive example, and then have done with this hypothetical body. We can ſuppoſe it of a long ſhape, reſting on one point ; we can ſuppoſe two weights A, B, ſuſpended at the extremities, and the whole in equilibrio. We commonly expreſs this ſtate of things by ſaying that A and B are in equilibrio. This is very inaccurate. A is in fact in equilibrio with the united action of all the ſprings which connect the ball to which it is applied with the adjoining balls. Theſe ſprings are brought into action, and each is in equilibrio with the joint action of all the rest. Thus through the whole extent of the hypothetical body, the ſprings are brought into action in a way and in a degree which mathematics can eaſily inveſtigate. We need not do this ; it is enough for our purpoſe that our imagination readily diſcovers that ſome ſprings are ſtretched, others are compreſſed, and that a preſſure is excited on the middle point of ſupport, and the ſupport exerts a reaction which preciſely balances it ; and the other weight is, in like manner, in immediate equilibrio with the equivalent of the actions of all the ſprings which connect the laſt ball with its neighbours. Now take the analogical or reſembling caſe, an oblong piece of ſolid matter, reſting on a fulcrum, and loaded with two weights in equilibrio. For the actions of the connecting ſprings ſubſtitute the corpuſcular forces, and the reſult will reſemble that of the hypotheſis.</p><p>Now as there is ſomething that is at leaſt analogous to a change of diſtance of the particles, and a concomitant change of the intenſity of the connecting ; forces, we may expreſs this in the ſame way that we are accuſtomed to do in ſimilar caſes. Let A and B (fig. 1.<note anchored="false" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Plate CCCCLXXXIV.</p></note>) repreſent the centres of two particles of a coherent elaſtic body in their quieſcent inactive ſtate, and let us conſider only the mechanical condition of B. The body may be ſtretched. In this caſe the diſtance A B of the particles may become A C. In this ſtate there is ſomething which makes it neceſſary to employ a force to keep the particles at this diſtance. C has a tendency towards A, or we may ſay that A attracts C. We may repreſent the magnitude of this tendency of C <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> A, or this attraction of A, by a line C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> perpendicular to A C. Again, the body may be compreſſed, and the diſtance A B may become A D. Something obliges us to employ force to continue this compreſſion ; and D tends <hi rend="italic">from</hi> A, or A appears to <hi rend="italic">repel</hi> D. The intenſity of this tendency or repulsion may be repreſented by another perpendicular D d; and, to repreſent the different directions of theſe tendencies, or the different nature of theſe actions, we may set D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> on the oppoſite fide of A B. It is in this manner that the Abbé Boſcovich has repreſented the actions of corpuſcular forces in his celebrated Theory of Natural Philoſophy. Newton had ſaid, that, as the great movements of the ſolar ſyſtem were regulated by forces operating at a diſtance and varying with the diſtance, ſo he ſtrongly ſuſpected <hi rend="italic">(valde ſuſpicor)</hi> that all the phenomena of coheſion, with all its modifications in the different ſenſible forms of aggregation, and in the phenomena of chemiſtry and phyſiology, reſulted from the ſimilar agency of forces varying with the diſtance of the particles. The learned Jeſuit purſued this thought ; and has ſhown, that if we ſuppoſe an ultimate atom of matter endowed with powers of attraction and repulſion, varying, both in kind and degree, with the diſtance, and if this force be the ſame in every atom, it may be regulated by ſuch a relation to the diſtance from the neighbouring atom, that a collection of ſuch atoms may have all the ſenſible appearances of bodies in their different forms of ſolids, liquids, and vapours, elaſtic or unelaſtic, and endowed with all the properties which we perceive, by whoſe immediate operation the phenomena of motion by impulſe, and all the phenomena of chemiſtry, and of animal and vegetable economy, may be produced. He ſhows, that not- withſtanding a perfect ſameness, and even a great ſimplicity in this atomical conſtitution, there will reſult from this union all that unſpeakable variety of form and property which diversify and embelliſh the face of nature. We ſhall take another opportunity of giving ſuch an account of this celebrated work as it deferves. We mention it only, by the by, as ſar as a general notion of it will be of ſome ſervice on the preſent occaſion. For this purpoſe, we just obſerve that Boſcovich conceives a particle of any individual species of matter to conſiſt of an unknown number of particles of ſimpler conſtitution ; each of which particles, in their turn, is compounded of particles ſtill more limply conſtituted, and ſo on through an unknown number of orders, till we arrive at the ſimpleſt poſſible conſtitution of a particle of tangible matter, suſceptible of length, breadth, and thickneſs, and neceſſarily conſiſting of four atoms of matter. And he ſhows that the more complex we ſuppoſe the conſtitution of a particle, the more must the ſenſible qualities of the aggregate resemble the obſerved qualities of tangible bodies. In particular, he ſhows how a particle may be ſo conſtituted, that although it act on one other particle of the ſame kind through a conſiderable interval, the interpoſition of a third particle of the ſame kind may render it totally, or almoſt totally, inactive; and therefore an aſſemblage of ſuch particles would form ſuch a fluid as air. All theſe curious inferences are made with uncontrovertible evidence ; and the greateſt encouragement is thus given to the mathematical philoſopher to hope, that by cautious and patient proceeding in this way, we may gradually approach to a knowledge of the laws of coheſion, that will not ſhun a compariſon even with the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> of Newton. No ſtep can be made in this inveſtigation, but by obſerving with care, and generalizing with judgment, the phenomena, which are abundantly numerous, and much more at our command than thoſe of the great and ſenſible motions of bodies. Following this plan, we obſerve,</p><p>4thly, It is matter of fact, that every body has ſome degree of compreſſibility and dilatability ; and when the changes of dimension are ſo moderate that the body completely recovers<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0011.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0005"/>
its original dimenſions on the ceſſation of the changing force, the extensions or compreſſions are ſensibly proportional to the extending or compreſſing forces ; and therefore <hi rend="italic">the connecting forces are proportional to the distances of the particles from their quieſcent, neutral, or inactive positions.</hi> This ſeems to have been firſt viewed as a law of nature by the penetrating eye of Dr Robert Hooke, one of the moſt eminent philoſophers of the laſt century. He publiſhed a cipher, which he ſaid contained the theory of ſpringineis and of the motions of bodies by the action of springs. It was this, <hi rend="italic">cc i i i n o s s s t t u u.—</hi> When explained in his diſſertation, publiſhed ſome years after, it was ut <hi rend="italic">tensio sic vis.</hi> This is preciſely the propoſition juſt now aſſerted as a general fact, a law of nature. This diſſertation is full of curious obſervations of facts in ſupport of his aſſertion. In his application to the motion of bodies he gives his noble diſcovery of the balance-ſpring of a watch, which is founded on this law. The ſpring, as it is more and more coiled up, or unwound, by the motion of the balance, acts on it with a force proportional to the diſtance of the balance from its quieſcent poſition. The balance therefore is acted on by an accelerating force, which varies in the ſame manner as the force of gravity acting on a pendulum ſwinging in a cycloid. Its vibrations therefore muſt be performed in equal time, whether they are wide or narrow. In the ſame diſſertation Hooke mentions all the facts which John Bernoulli afterwards adduced in ſupport of Leibnitz’s whimſical doctrine of the force of bodies in motion, or the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">vires vives;</hi> a doctrine which Hooke might juſtly have claimed as his own, had he not ſeen its futulity.</p><p>Experiments made ſince the time of Hooke ſhow that this law is ſtrictly true in the extent to which we have limited it, viz. in all the changes of form which will be completely undone by the elaſticity of the body. It is nearly true to a much greater extent. James Bernoulli, in his diſſertation on the elaſtic curve, relates ſome experiments of his own, which ſeem to deviate conſiderably from it ; but on cloſe examination they do not. The fineſt experiments are thoſe of Coulomb, publiſhed in ſome late volumes of the memoirs of the Academy of Paris. He ſuſpended balls by wires, and obſerved their motions of oſcillation, which he found accurately correſponding with this law.</p><p>This we ſhall find to be a very important fact in the doctrine of the ſtrength of bodies, and we deſire the reader to make it familiar to his mind. If we apply to this our manner of expreſſing theſe forces by perpendicular ordinates <hi rend="italic">C c, D d</hi> (fig. 1.), we muſt take other ſituations E, F, of the particle B, and draw E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> Ff <hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we muſt have D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>: F f = BD : EF, or C <hi rend="italic">c</hi>: E <hi rend="italic">e =</hi> EC : BE. In ſuch a ſuppoſition F- <hi rend="italic">d</hi> B <hi rend="italic">c e</hi> muſt be a ſtraight line. But we ſhall havg abundant evidence by and by that this cannot be ſtrictly true, and that the line B c <hi rend="italic">e</hi> which limits the ordinates expreſſing the attractive forces becomes concave towards the line ABE, and that the part B <hi rend="italic">d f</hi> is convex towards it. All that can be ſafely concluded from the experiments hitherto made is, that <hi rend="italic">to a certain extent</hi> the forces, both attractive and repulſive, are sensi <hi rend="italic">bly</hi> proportional to the dilatations and compreſſions. For,</p><p><hi rend="italic">5thly,</hi> It is univerſally observed, that when the dilatations have proceeded a certain length, a leſs addition of force is sufficient to increaſe the dilatation in the ſame degree. This is always obſerved when the body has been ſo far ſtretched that it takes a ſet, and does not completely recover its form. The like may be generally obſerved in compreſſions. Moſt perſons will recollect, that in violently ſtretching an elaſtic cord, it becomes ſuddenly weaker, or more eaſily ſtretched. But theſe phenomena do not poſitively prove a diminution of the corpuſcular force acting on one particle ; It more probably ariſes from the diſunion of ſome particles, whoſe action contributed to the whole or ſenſible effect. And in compreſſions we may ſuppoſe ſomething of the ſame kind ; for when we compreſs a body in one direction, it commonly bulges out in another; and in cases of very violent action ſome particles may be diſunited, whoſe tranſverſe action had formerly balanced <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the compreſſing force. For the reader will ſee on reflection, that ſince the compreſſion in one direction causes the body to bulge out in the tranſverſe direction ; and ſince this bulging out is in oppoſition to the tranſverſe forces of attraction, it muſt employ ſome part of the compreſſing force. And the common appearances are in perfect uniformity with this conception of things. When we preſs a bit of dryiſh clay, it ſwells out and cracks tranſverſely. When a pillar of wood is overloaded, it ſwells out, and ſmall crevices appear in the direction of the fibres. After this it will not bear half of the load. This the carpenters call <hi rend="smallcaps">crippling</hi>; and a knowledge of the circumſtances which modify it is of great importance, and enables us to underſtand ſome very paradoxical appearances, as will be ſhown byand by.</p><p>This partial diſuniting of particles formerly cohering is, we imagine, the chief reaſon why the totality of the forces, which really oppoſe an external ſtrain does not increaſe in the proportion of the extenſions and compreſſions. But ſufficient evidence will also be given that the forces which would connect one particle with one other particle do not augment in the accurate proportion of the change of diſtance ; that in extenſions they increaſe more ſlowly, and in compreſſions more rapidly.</p><p>But there is another cauſe of this deviation perhaps equally effectual with the former. Moſt bodies manifeſt ſome degree of ductility. Now what is this ? The fact is, that the parts have taken a new arrangement, in which they again cohere. Therefore, in the passage to this new arrangement, the ſenſible forces, which are the joint reſult of many corpuſcular forces, begin to reſpect this new arrangement inſtead of the former. This muſt change the ſimple law of corpuſcular force, characteriſtic of the particular ſpecies of matter under examination. It does not require much reflection to convince us that the poſſible arrangements which the particles of a body may acquire, without appearing to change their nature, muſt be more numerous according as the particles are of a more complex conſtitution ; and it is reaſonable to suppoſe that the conſtitution even of the moſt ſimple kind of matter that we are acquainted with is exceedingly complex. Our microſcopes ſhow us animals ſo minute, that a heap of them muſt appear to the naked eye an uniform maſs with a grain finer than that of the fineſt marble or razor hone ; and yet each of theſe has not only limbs, but bones, muſcular fibres, blood-vessels, fibres, and a blood consiſting, in all probability, of globules organiſed and complex like, our own. The imagination is here loſt in wonder; and nothing is left us but to adore inconceivable art and wisdom, and to exult in the thought that we are the only ſpectators of this beautiful ſcene who can derive pleaſure from the view. What is trodden under foot with indifference, even by the half-reaſoning elephant, may be made by us the ſource of the pureſt and moſt unmixed pleaſure. But let us proceed, to obſerve,</p><p><hi rend="italic">6thly,</hi> That the forces which connect the particles of tangible bodies change by a change of diſtance, not only in degree, but alſo in kind. The particle B (fig. 1.) is attracted by A when in the situation C or E. It is repelled by it when. at D or F. It is not affected by it when in the ſituation B. The reader is requeſted carefully to remark, that this is not an inference founded on the authority of our mathematical figure. The figure is an expreſſion (to aſſiſt the imagination) of facts in nature. It requires no force to keep the particles of a body in<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0012.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0006"/>
their quieſcent ſituations: but if they are ſeparated by ſtretching the body, they endeavour (pardon the figurative expreſſion) to come together again. If they are brought nearer by compreſſion, they endeavour to recede. This endeavour is manifeſted by the neceſſity of employing force to maintain the extension or condenſation ; and we repreſent this by the different poſition of our lines. But this is not all : the particle B, which is repelled by A when in the ſituation F or D, is neutral when at B, and is attracted when at C or E, may be placed at ſuch a diſtance A G from A greater than AB that it ſhall be again repelled, or at ſuch a diſtance AH that it ſhall again be attracted ; and these alterations may be repeated again and again. This is curious and important, and requires ſomething more than a bare aſſertion for its proof.</p><p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> we mentioned the moſt curious and valuable obſervations of Sir Iſaac Newton, by which it appears that light is thus alternately attracted and repelled by bodies. The rings of colour which appear between the object glaſſes of long teleſcopes ſhowed, that in the ſmall interval of 1/1000th of an inch, there are at leaſt an hundred ſuch changes obſervable, and that it is highly probable that theſe alternations extend to a much greater diſtance. At one of theſe diſtances the light actually converges towards the ſolid matter of the glaſs, which we expreſs ſhortly, by ſaying that it is attracted by it, and that at the next diſtance it declines from the glaſs, or is repelled by it. The ſame thing is more ſimply inferred from the phenomena of light paſſing by the edges of knives and other opaque bodies. We refer the reader to the experiments themſelves, the detail being too long for this place; and we requeſt the reader to conſider them minutely and attentively, and to form diſtinct notions of the inferences drawn from them. And we deſire it to be remarked, that although Sir Iſaac, in his discuſſion, always conſiders light as a ſet of corpuſcles moving in free ſpace, and obeying the actions of external forces like any other matter, the particular concluſion in which we are juſt now intereſted does not at all depend on this notion of the nature of light. Should we, with Des Cartes or Huygens, ſuppoſe light to be the undulation of an elaſtic medium, the concluſion will be the ſame. The undulations at certain diſtances are diſturbed by forces directed towards the body, and at a greater diſtance, the diſturbing forces tend <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the body.</p><p>But the ſame alternations of attraction and repulſion may be obſerved between the particles of common matter. If we take a piece of very flat and well poliſhed glaſs, ſuch as are made for the horizon glaſſes of a good Hadley’s quadrant, and if we wrap round it a fibre of ſilk as it comes from the cocoon, taking care that the fibre nowhere cross another, and then press this pretty hard on ſuch another piece of glaſs, it will lift it up and keep it ſuſpended. The particles therefore of the one do moſt certainly attract thoſe of the other, and this at a diſtance equal to the thickneſs of the ſilk fibre. This is nearly the limit ; and it ſometimes requires a conſiderable preſſure to produce the effect. The preſſure is effectual only by compreſſing the ſilk fibre, and thus diminiſhing the diſtance between the glaſs plates. This adheſion cannot be attributed to the preſſure of the atmosphere, becauſe there is nothing to hinder the air from inſinuating itſelf between the plates, ſince they are ſeparated by the ſilk. Beſides, the experiment ſucceeds equally well under the receiver of an air-pump. This moſt valuable experiment was firſt made by Huygens, who reported it to the Royal Society. It is narrated in the Philoſophical Transactions, n⁰ 86.</p><p>Here then is an attraction acting, like gravity, at a distance. But take away the ſilk fibre, and try to make the glaſſes touch each other, and we ſhall find a very great force neceſſary. By Newton’s experiments it appears, that unleſs the prilmatic colours begin to appear between the glaſſes, they are at leaſt 1/890th of art inch aſunder or more. Now we know that a very conſiderable force is neceſſary for producing theſe colours, and that the more we press the glaſſes together the more rings of colours appear. It alſo appears ſrom Newton’s meaſures, that the difference of diſtance between the glaſſes where each of theſe colours appear is about the 89,000th part oſ an inch. We know farther, that when we have produced the laſt appearance of a greaſy or pearly colour, and then augment the preſſure, making it about a thouſand pounds on the ſquare inch, all colours vaniſh, and the two pieces of glaſs ſeem to make one tranſparent undiſtinguiſhable maſs. They appear now to have no air between them, or to be in mathematical contact. But another fact ſhows this concluſion to be premature. The ſame circles of colours appear in the top of a ſoap bubble ; and as it grows thinner at top, there appears an unreflecting ſpot in the middle. We have the greateſt probability therefore that the perfect tranſparency in the middle of the two glaſſes does not ariſe from their being in contact, but becauſe the thickneſs of air between them is too ſmall in that place for the reflection of light. Nay, Newton expreſsly found no reflection where the thickneſs was 2/5ths or more of the 1/89000th part of an inch.</p><p>All this while the glaſſes are ſtrongly repelling each other, for great preſſure is neceſſary for continuing the appearance of thoſe colours, and they vaniſh in ſucceſion as the preſſure is diminiſhed. This vaniſhing of the colours is a proof that the glaſſes are moving off from each other, or repelling each other. But we can put an end to this repulſion by very ſtrong preſſure, and at the ſame time sliding the glaſſes on each other. We do not pretend to account so this effect of the sliding motion ; but the fact is, that by ſo doing, the glaſſes will cohere with very great force, ſo that we ſhall break them by any attempt to pull them aſunder. It commonly happens (at leaſt it did ſo with us), that in this sliding compreſſion of two ſmooth flat plates of glaſs they ſcratch and mutually deſtroy each other’s ſurface. It is alſo worth remarking, that different kinds of glaſs exhibit different properties in this reſpect. Flint glaſs will attract even though a ſilk fibre lies double between them, and they much more readily cohere by this sliding pressure.</p><p>Here then are two diſtances at which the plates of glaſs attract each other ; namely, when the ſilk fibre is interpoſed, and when they are forced together with this sliding motion. And in any intermediate ſituation they repel each other. We ſee the ſame thing in other ſolid bodies. Two pieces of lead made perfectly clean, may be made to cohere by grinding them together in the ſame manner. It is in this way that pretty ornaments of ſilver are united to iron. The piece is ſcraped clean, and a ſmall bit of ſilver like a fiſh ſcale is laid on. The die which is to ſtrike it into a flower or other ornament is then ſet on it, and we give it a ſmart blow, which forces the metals into contact as firm as if they were ſoldered together. It ſometimes happens that the die adheres to the coin ſo that they cannot be ſeparated : and it is found that this frequently happens, when the engraving is ſuch, that the raiſed figure is not completely ſurrounded with a ſmooth flat ground. The probable cauſe of this is curious. When the coin has a flat ſurface all around, this is produced by the moſt prominent part of the die. This applies to the metal, and completely confines the air which filled the hollow of the die. As the preſſure goes on, the metal is ſqueezed up into the hollow of the die ; but there is ſtill air compressed between them, which cannot eſcape by any paſſage. It is therefore prodigiously<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0013.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0007"/>
condensed, and exerts an elaſticity proportioned to the condenſation. This ſerves to ſeparate the die from the metal when the ſtroke is over. The hollow part of the die has not touched the metal all the while, and we may ſay that the impreſſion was made by air. If this air eſcape by any engraving reaching through the border, they cohere inſeparably.</p><p>We have admitted that the glaſs plates are in contact when they cohere thus firmly. But we are not certain of this : for if we take theſe cohering glaſſes, and touch them with water, it quickly inſinuates itſelf between them. Yet they ſtill cohere, but can now be pretty easily ſeparated.</p><p>It is owing to this repulſion, exerted through its proper ſphere, that certain powders ſwim on the ſurface of water, and are wetted with great difficulty. Certain infects can run about on the ſurface of water. They have bruſhy feet, which occupy a considerable ſurface ; and if their ſteps are viewed with a magnifying glaſs, the ſurface of the water is ſeen depreſſed all around, reſembling the footſteps of a man walking on feather-beds. This is owing to a repulſion between the brush and the water. A common fly cannot walk in this manner on water. Its feet are wetted, becauſe they attract the water inſtead of repelling it. A ſteel needle, wiped very clean, will lie on the ſurface of water, making an impression as a great bar would make on a featherbed ; and its weight is leſs than that of the displaced water. A dew drop lies on the leaves of plants without touching them mathematically, as is plain from the extreme brilliancy of the reflection at the poſterior ſurface ; nay, it may be ſometimes obſerved that the drops of rain lie on the ſurface of water, and roll about on it like balls on a table. Yet all theſe ſubſtances can be wetted ; that is, water can be applied to them at ſuch diſtances that they attract it.</p><p>What we ſaid a little ago of water inſinuating itſelf between the glaſs plates without altogether deſtroying their coheſion, ſhows that this coheſion is not the ſame that obtains between the particles of one of the plates ; that is, the two plates are not in the ſtate of one continued maſs. It is highly probable, therefore, that between theſe two ſtates there is an intermediate ſtate of repulſion, nay, perhaps many ſuch, alternated with attractive ſtates.</p><p>A piece of ice is elaſtſe, for it rebounds and it rings. Its particles, therefore, when compreſſed, resile ; and when ſtretched, contract again. The particles are therefore in the ſtate repreſented by B in figure I. acted on by repulſive forces, if brought nearer ; and by attractive forces, if drawn further aſunder. Ice expands, like all other bodies, by heat. It abſorbs a vaſt quantity of fire ; which, by combining its attractions and repulſions with thoſe of the particles of ice, changes completely the law of action, without making any ſenſible change in the diſtance of the particles, and the ice becomes water. In this new ſtate the particles are again in limits between attractive and repulſive forces ; for water has been ſhown,by the experiments of Canton and Zimmerman, to be elaſtſe or compreſſible. It again expands by heat. It again abſorbs a prodigious quantity of heat, and becomes elaſtſe vapour ; its particles repelling each other at all distances yet obſerved. The diſtance between the particles of one plate of glaſs and thoſe of another which lies on it, and is carried by it, is a diſtance of repulſion ; for the force which ſupports the upper piece is acting in oppoſition to its weight. This diſtance is leſs than that at which it would <hi rend="italic">ſuſpend</hi> it below it with a ſilk fibre interpoſed ; for no priſmatic colours appear between them when the ſilk fibre is interpoſed. But the diſtance at which glaſs attracts water is much leſs than this, for no colours appear when glaſs is wetted with water. This diſtance is left, and not greater, than the other ; for when the glaſſes have water interpoſed between them inſtead of air, it is found, that when any particular colour appears, the thickneſs of the plate of water is to that of the plate of air which would produce the ſame colour nearly as 3 to 4. Now, if a piece of glaſs be wetted, and exhibit no colour, and another piece of glaſs be simply laid on it, no colour will appear ; but if they are ſtrongly preſſed, the colours appear in the ſame manner as if the glaſſes had air between. Alſo, when glaſs is simply wetted, and the film of water is allowed to evaporate, when it is thus reduced to a proper thinneſs, the colours ſhow themſelves in great beauty.</p><p>Theſe are a few of many thouſand facts, by which it is unqueſtionably proved that the particles of tangible matter are connected by forces acting at a diſtance, varying with the diſtance, and alternately attractive and repulſive. If we repreſent theſe forces as we have already done in fig. 1. by the ordinates C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> E e, Ff <hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c. of a curve, it is evident that this curve must croſs the axis at all thoſe diſtances where the forces change from attractive to repulſive, and the curve must have branches alternately above and below the axis.</p><p>All theſe alternations of attraction and repulſion take place at ſmall and inſenſible diſtances. At all ſenſible diſtances the particles are influenced by the attraction of gravitation ; and therefore this part of the curve muſt be a hyperbola whoſe equation is <hi rend="italic">y — a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> <hi rend="italic">/x</hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">.</hi> What is the form of</p><p>the curve correſponding to the ſmalleſt diſtance of the particles ? that is, what is the mutual action between the particles juſt before their coming into abſolute contact? Analogy ſhould lead us to ſuppoſe it to be repulſion : for solidity is the laſt and ſimpleſt form of bodies with which we are acquainted. Fluids are more compounded, containing fire as an eſſential ingredient. We ſhould conclude that this ultimate repulſion is inſuperable, for the hardeſt bodies are the most elaſtic. We are fully entitled to ſay, that this repelling force exceeds all that we have ever yet applied to overcome it ; nay, there are good reaſons for saying that this ultimate repulſion, by which the particles are kept from mathematical contact, is really inſuperable in its own nature, and that it is impoſſible to produce mathematical contact.</p><p>We ſhall juſt mention one of theſe, which we conſider as unanſwerable. Suppoſe two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter A and B. Let A be at reſt, and B move up to it with the velocity 2 ; and let us ſuppoſe that it comes into mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the word). Both move with the velocity I. This is granted by all to be the final reſult of the colliſion. Now the inſtant of time in which this communication happens is no part either of the duration of the ſolitary motion of A, nor of the joint motion of A and B : It is the ſeparation or boundary between them. It is at once the end of the firſt, and the beginning of the ſecond, belonging equally to both. A was moving with the velocity 2. The diſtinguiſhing circumſtance therefore of its mechanical ſtate is, that it has a determination (however incomprehenſible) by which it would move for ever with the velocity 2, if nothing changed it. This it has during the whole of its ſolitary motion, and therefore in the laſt inſtant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole of the joint motion, and therefore in the firſt inſtant of this motion, the atom A has a determination by which it would move for ever with the velocity 1. In one and the ſame inſtant, therefore, the atom A has two incompatible determinations. Whatever notion we can form of this ſtate,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0014.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0008"/>
which we call velocity, as a distinction of condition, the ſame impoſſibility of conception or the ſame abſurdity occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other way than by laying, that this change of A’s motion is brought about by inſenſible gradations ; that is, that A and B influence each other preciſely as they would do if a ſlender ſpring were interpoſed. The reader is delired to look at what we have ſaid in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics, §</hi> 82.</p><p>The two magnets there ſpoken of are good repreſentatives of two atoms endowed with mutual powers of repulſion ; and the communication of motion is accompliſhed in both caſes in preciſely the ſame manner.</p><p>If, therefore, we ſhall ever be ſo fortunate as to diſcover the law of variation of that force which connects one <hi rend="smallcaps">atom</hi> of matter with another atom, and which is therefore characteriſtic of matter, and the ultimate ſource of all its ſenſible qualities, the curve whoſe ordinates repreſent the kind and the intenſity of this atomical force will be ſomething like that ſketched in fig. 2. The firſt branch <hi rend="italic">a n</hi> B will have AK (perpendicular to the axis AH) for its aſſymptote, and the laſt branch l m <hi rend="italic">o</hi> will be to all ſenſe a hyperbola, having A O for its aſſymptote ; and the ordinates <hi rend="italic">l</hi> L, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> M, &amp;c. will be proportional to 1/AL <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, 1/AM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c. expressing the univerſal gravitation of matter. It will have many branches B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C, D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> E, FfG, &amp;c. expreſſing attractions, and alternate repulſive branches C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> D, E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> F, G g H, &amp;c. All theſe will be contained within a diſtance A H, which does not exceed a very minute fraction of an inch.</p><p>The ſimpleſt particle which can be a conſtituent of a body having length, breadth, and thickneſs, muſt conſiſt of four ſuch atoms, all of which combine their influence on each atom of another ſuch particle. It is evident that the curve which expreſſes the forces that connect two ſuch particles muſt be totally different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle. Suppoſing the laſt known, our mathematical knowledge is quite able to diſcover the firſt ; but when we proceed to compoſe a body of particles, each of which conſiſts of four ſuch particles, we may venture to ſay, that the compound force which connects them is almoſt beyond our ſearch, and that the diſcovery of the primary force from an <hi rend="italic">accurate</hi> knowledge of the corpuſcular forces of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> particular matter is abſolutely out of our power.</p><p>All that we can learn is, the poſſibility, nay the certainty, of an innumerable variety of external ſenſible forms and qualities, by which different kinds of matter will be diſtinguiſhed, ariſing from the number, the order of compoſition, and the arrangement of the ſubordinate particles of which a particle of this or that kind of matter is compoſed. All theſe varieties will take place at thoſe ſmall and inſenſible diſtances which are between A and H, and may produce all that variety which we obſerve in the tangible or mechanical forms of bodies, ſuch as elaſticity, ductility, hardneſs, ſoftneſs, fluidity, vapour, and all thoſe unſeen motions or actions which we obſerve in fuſion and congelation, evaporation and condenſation, ſolution and precipitation, crystallization, vegetable and animal aſſimilation and ſecretion, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. while all bodies muſt be, in a certain degree, elaſtic, all muſt gravitate, and all muſt be imcompenetrable.</p><p>This general and ſatisfactory reſemblance between the appearances of tangible matter and the legitimate conſequence of this general hypothetical property of an atom of matter, affords a conſiderable probability that ſuch is the origin of all the phenomena. We earneſtly recommend to our readers a <hi rend="italic">careful</hi> peruſal of Boſcovich’s celebrated treatiſe. A careful peruſal is neceſſary for ſeeing its value ; and nothing will be got by a haſty look at it. The reader will be particularly pleaſed with the facility and evidence with which the ingenious author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the explanation which he has given of fluidity, and his deduction from thence of the laws of hydroſtatics. No part of the treatiſe is more valuable than the doctrine of the propagation of preſſure through ſolid bodies. This, however, is but just touched on in the course of the inveſtigation of the principles of mechanics. We ſhall borrow as much as will ſuffice for our preſent inquiry into the ſtrength of materials ; and we truſt that our readers are not diſpleaſed with this general ſketch of the doctrine (if it may be ſo called) of the coheſion of bodies. It is curious and important in itſelf, and is the foundation of all the knowledge we can acquire of the preſent article. We are ſorry to ſay that it is as yet a new ſubject of ſtudy ; but it is a very promiſing one, and we by no means deſpair of ſeeing the whole of chemiſtry brought by its means within the pale of mechanical ſcience. The great and diſtinguiſhing agent in chemiſtry is heat, or fire the cauſe of heat ; and one of its most singular effects is the converſion of bodies into elaſtic vapour. We have the cleareſt evidence that this is brought about by mechanical forces : for it can be oppoſed or prevented by external pressure, a very familiar mechanical force. We may perhaps find another mechanical force which will prevent fuſion.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Having</hi> now made our readers familiar with the mode of action in which coheſion operates in giving ſtrength to ſolid bodies, we proceed to conſider the ſtrains to which this ſtrength is oppoſed.</p><p>A piece of ſolid matter is expoſed to four kinds of ſtrain, pretty different in the manner of their operation.</p><p>1. It may be torn aſunder, as in the cafe of ropes, ſtretchers, king-posts, tye-beams, &amp;c.</p><p>2. It may be cruſhed, as in the cafe of pillars, poſts, and truſs-beams.</p><p>3. It may be broken acroſs, as happens to a joiſt or lever of any kind.</p><p>4. It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the caſe of the axle of a wheel, the nail of a preſs, &amp;c.</p><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">It may be pulled asunder.</hi></p><p>This is the ſimpleſt of all ſtrains, and the others are indeed modifications of it. To this the force of coheſion is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> oppoſed, with very little modification of its action by any particular circumſtances.</p><p>When a long cylindrical or priſmatic body, ſuch as a rod of wood or metal, or a rope, is drawn by one end, it muſt be refilled at the other, in order to bring its coheſion into action. When it is faſtened at one end, we cannot conceive it any other way than as equally ſtretched in all its parts ; for all our obſervations and experiments on natural bodies concur in ſhowing us that the forces which connect their particles, in any way whatever, are equal and oppoſite. This is called the <hi rend="italic">third law of motion ;</hi> and we admit its univerſality, while we affirm that it is purely experimental (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics).</hi> Yet we have met with dissertations by perſons of eminent knowledge, where propoſitions are maintained inconſiſtent with this. During the diſpute about the communication of motion, ſome of the ableſt writers have ſaid, that a ſpring compreſſed or ſtretched at the two ends was gradually leſs and leſs compreſſed or ſtretched from the extremities towards the middle : but the ſame writers acknowledged the univerſal equality of action and reaction, which is quite incompatible with this ſtate of the ſpring. No ſuch inequality of compreſſion or dilatation has ever been obſer-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0015.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0009"/>
ved ; and a little reflection will ſhow it to be impoſſible, in conſistency with the equality of action and reaction.</p><p>Since all parts are thus equally ſtretched, it follows, that the ſtrain in any tranſverſe lection is the ſame, as alſo in every point of that ſection. If therefore the body be suppoſed of a homogeneous texture, the coheſion of the parts is equable ; and ſince every part is equally ſtretched, the particles are drawn to equal diſtances from their quieſcent poſitions, and the forces which are thus excited, and now exerted in opposition to the ſtraining force, are equal. This external force may be increaſed by degrees, which will gradually ſeparate the part of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting forces increaſe with this increaſe of diſtance, till at laſt the coheſion of ſome particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture, becauſe the remaining forces are now weaker than before.</p><p>It is the united force of coheſion, immediately before the diſunion of the firſt particles, that we call the <hi rend="smallcaps">strength</hi> of the ſection. It may alſo be properly called its <hi rend="smallcaps">absolute strength,</hi> being exerted in the ſimpleſt form, and not modified by any relation to other circumſtances.</p><p>If the external force has not produced any permanent change on the body, and it therefore recovers its former dimenſions when the force is withdrawn, it is plain that this ſtrain may be repeated as often as we pleaſe, and the body which withſtands it once will always withſtand it. It is evident that this ſhould be attended to in all conſtructions, and that in all our inveſtigations on this ſubject this ſhould be kept ſtrictly in view. When we treat a piece of ſoft clay in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed muſt be very ſmall. If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed torn aſunder ; but it has become ſomewhat more ſlender : the number of particles in a croſs ſection is now smaller ; and therefore, although it will again, in this new form, ſuffer, or allow an endleſs repetition of a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> ſtrain without any farther permanent change, this ſtrain is ſmaller than the former.</p><p>Something of the ſame kind happens in all bodies which receive a <hi rend="smallcaps">sett</hi> by the ſtrain to which they are expoſed. All ductile bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile. Such bodies break completely whenever they are ſtretched beyond the limit of their perfect elaſticity. Bodies of a fibrous ſtructure exhibit very great varieties in their coheſion. In ſome the fibres have no lateral coheſion, as in the caſe of a rope. The only way in which all the fibres can be made to unite their ſtrength is, to twiſt them together. This cauſes them to bind each other ſo faſt, that any one of them will break before it can be drawn out of the bundle. In other fibrous bodies, ſuch as timber, the fibres are held together by ſome cement or gluten. This is ſeldom as ſtrong as the fibre. Accordingly timber is much eaſier pulled aſunder in a direction tranſverſe to the fibres. There is, however, every poſſible variety in this particular.</p><p>In ſtretching and breaking fibrous bodies, the viſible extenſion is frequently very conſiderable. This is not solely the increaſing of the diſtance of the particles of the cohering fibre : the greateſt part chiefly ariſes from drawing the crooked fibre ſtraight. In this, too, there is great diverſity ; and it is accompanied with important differences in their power of withſtanding a ſtrain. In ſome woods, ſuch as fir, the fibres on which the ſtrength most depends are very ſtraight. Such woods are commonly very elaſtic, do not take a sett, and break abruptly when overſtrained : others, ſuch as oak and birch, have their reſiſting fibres very undulating and crooked, and ſtretch very senſibly by a ſtrain. They are very liable to take a ſet, and they do not break ſo ſuddenly, but give warning by <hi rend="italic">complaining,</hi> as the carpenters call it ; that is, by giving viſible ſigns of a derangement of texture. Hard bodies of an uniform glaſſy ſtructure, or granulated like ſtones, are elaſtic through the whole extent of their coheſion, and take no ſett, but break at once when overloaded.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the immenſe variety which nature exhibits in the ſtructure and coheſion of bodies, there are certain general facts of which we may now avail ourselves with advantage. In particular,</p><p>The abſolute coheſion is proportional to the area of the ſection. This muſt be the caſe where the texture is perfectly uniform, as we have reaſon to think it is in glaſs and the ductile metals. The coheſion of each particle being alike, the whole coheſion muſt be proportional to their number, that is, to the area of the ſection. The ſame muſt be admitted with reſpect to bodies of a granulated texture, where the granulation is regular and uniform. The ſame muſt be admitted of fibrous bodies, if we ſuppoſe their fibres equally ſtrong, equally dense, and similarly diſpoſed through the whole ſection ; and this we muſt either ſuppoſe, or muſt ſtate the diverſity, and meaſure the cohesion accordingly.</p><p>We may therefore aſſert, as a general propoſition on this ſubject, that the abſolute ſtrength in any part of a body by which it reſiſts being pulled aſunder, or the force which muſt be employed to tear it aſunder <hi rend="italic">in that part,</hi> is proportional to the area of the ſection perpendicular to the extending force.</p><p>Therefore all cylindrical or priſmatical rods are equally ſtrong in every part, and will break alike in any part ; and bodies which have unequal ſections will always break in the ſlendereſt part. The length of the cylinder or priſm has no effect on the ſtrength ; and the vulgar notion, that it is eaſier to break a very long rope than a ſhort one, is a very great miſtake. Alſo the abſolute ſtrengths of bodies which have ſimilar ſections are proportional to the ſquares of their diameters or homologous ſides of the ſection.</p><p>The weight of the body itſelf may be employed to ſtrain it and to break it. It is evident, that a rope may be ſo long as to break by its own weight. When the rope is hanging perpendicularly, although it is equally ſtrong in every part, it will break towards the upper end, becauſe the ſtrain on any part is the weight of all that is below it. Its <hi rend="smallcaps">relative strength</hi> in any part, or power of withſtanding the ſtrain which is actually laid on it, is inverſely as the quantity below that part.</p><p>When the rope is ſtretched horizontally, as in towing a ſhip, the ſtrain ariſing from its weight often bears a very ſenſible proportion to its whole ſtrength.</p><p>Let AEB (fig. 3.) be any portion of ſuch a rope, and AC, BC be tangents to the curve into which its gravity bends it. Complete the parallelogram ACBD It is well known that the curve is a catenaria, and that DC is perpendicular to the horizon ; and that DC is to AC as the weight of the rope AEB to the ſtrain at A.</p><p>In order that a suſpended heavy body may be equally able in every part to carry its own weight, the ſection in that part muſt be proportional to the ſolid contents of all that is below it. Suppoſe it a conoidal ſpindle, formed by the revolution of the curve A <hi rend="italic">a e</hi> (fig. 4.) round the axis CE. We muſt have AC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: ac <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = AEB ſol. : a E <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ſol. This condition requires the logarithmic curve for A <hi rend="italic">a e,</hi> of which C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the axis.</p><p>Theſe are the chief general rules which can be ſafely deduced from our cleareſt notions of the coheſion of bodies. In order to make any practical uſe of them, it is proper to have ſome meaſures of the coheſion of ſuch bodies as arc<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0016.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0010"/>
commonly employed in our mechanics, and other ſtructures where they are exposed to this kind of ſtrain. Theſe muſt be deduced ſolely from experiment. Therefore they muſt be conſidered as no more than general values, or as the averages of many particular trials. The irregularities are very great, becauſe none of the ſubſtances are constant in their texture and firmneſs. Metals differ by a thouſand circumſtances unknown to us, according to their purity, to the heat with which they were melted, to the moulds in which they were caſt, and the treatment they have afterwards received, by forging, wire-drawing, tempering, &amp;c.</p><p>It is a very curious and inexplicable fact, that by forging a metal, or by frequently drawing it through a ſmooth bole in a ſteel plate, its coheſion is greatly increaſed. This operation undoubtedly deranges the natural situation of the particles. They are ſqueezed cloſer together in one direction ; but it is not in the direction in which they refill the fracture. In this direction they are rather ſeparated to a greater diſtance. The general density, however, is augmented in all of them except lead, which grows rather rarer by wire-drawing : but its coheſion may be more than tripled by this operation. Gold, ſilver, and braſs, have their cohesion nearly tripled ; copper and iron have it more than doubled. In this operation they alſo grow much harder. It is proper to heat them to redneſs after drawing a little. This is called <hi rend="italic">nealing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">annealing.</hi> It ſoftens the metal again, and renders it ſusceptible of another drawing without the riſk of cracking in the operation.</p><p>We do not pretend to give any explanation of this remarkable and very important fact, which has ſomething reſembling it in woods and other fibrous bodies, as will be mentioned afterwards.</p><p>The varieties in the coheſion of ſtones and other minerals, and of vegetable and animal ſubſtances, are hardly ſuſceptible of any deſeription or claſſification.</p><p>We ſhall take for the meaſure of coheſion the number of pounds avoirdupois which are juſt sufficient to tear aſunder a rod or bundle of one inch ſquare.

The mixtures of copper and tin are particularly intereſting in the fabric of great guns. We see that, by mixing copper whoſe greateſt ſtrength does not exceed 37,000 with tin which does not exceed 6,000, we produce a metal whoſe tenacity is almoſt double, at the same time that it is harder and more easily wrought. It is, however, more sensible, which is a great inconvenience. We alſo ſee that a very ſmall addition of zinc almoſt doubles the tenacity of tin, and increaſes the tenacity of lead five times ; and a ſmall addition of lead doubles the tenacity of tin. Theſe are economical mixtures. This is a very valuable information to the plumbers for augmenting the ſtrength of waterpipes.</p><p>By having recourſe to theſe tables, the engineer can proportion the thickneſs of his pipes (of whatever metal) to the pressures to which they are expoſed.</p><p>2d, <hi rend="smallcaps">Woods.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> may premiſe to this part of the table the following general obſervations :</p><p>I. The wood immediately ſurrounding the pith or heart of the tree is the weakeſt, and its inferiority is ſo much more remarkable as the tree is older. In this aſſertion, however, we ſpeak with ſome hesitation. Muſchenoroek’s <hi rend="italic">detail</hi> of experiments is decidedly in the affirmative. Mr Buffon, on the other hand, ſays, that his experience has taught him that the heart of a sound tree is the ſtrongeſt ; but he gives no inſtances. We are certain, from many ob-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0017.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0011"/>
ſervations of our own on <hi rend="italic">very large</hi> oaks and firs, that the heart is much weaker than the exterior parts.</p><p>2. The wood next the bark, commonly called the wh <hi rend="italic">ite</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blea,</hi> is alſo weaker than the rest ; and the wood gradually increaſes in ſtrength as we recede from the centre to the blea.</p><p>3. The wood is ſtronger tn the middle of the trunk than at the ſpringing of the branches or at the root ; and the wood of the branches is weaker than that of the trunk.</p><p>4. The wood of the north side of all trees which grow in our European climates is the weakeſt, and that of the south-eaſt side is the ſtrongeſt ; and the difference is moſt remarkable in hedge row trees, and ſuch as grow singly. The heart of a tree is never in its centre, but always nearer to the north side, and the annual coats of wood are thinner on that side. In conformity with this, it is a general opinion of carpenters that timber is ſtronger whoſe annual plates are thicker. The trachea or air-veſſels are weaker than the ſimple ligneous fibres. Theſe air-veſſels are the same in diameter and number of rows in trees of the ſame ſpecies, and they make the viſible ſeparation between the annual plates. Therefore when theſe are thicker, they contain a greater proportion of the ſimple ligneous fibres.</p><p>5. All woods are more tenacious while green, and loſe very conſiderably by drying after the trees are felled.</p><p>The only author who has put it in our power to judge of the propriety of his experiments is Muſchenbroek. He has deſcribed his method of trial minutely, and it ſeems unexceptionable. The woods were all formed into flips fit for his apparatus, and part of the flip was cut away to a parallelopiped of 1/5th of an inch ſquare, and therefore 1/25th of a ſquare inch in ſection.

The numbers of this table correſponding to theſe two timbers may therefore be conſidered as the average of more than 50 trials made of each ; and he ſays that all the others were made with the ſame care. We cannot therefore see any reaſon for not considing in the reſults ; yet they are conſiderably higher than thoſe given by ſome other writers. Mr Pitot says, on the authority of his own experiments, and of thoſe of Mr Parent, that 60 pounds will juſt tear aſunder a ſquare line of sound oak, and that it will bear 50 with ſafety. This gives 8640 for the utmoſt ſtrength of a ſquare inch, which is much inferior to Muſchenbroek’s valuation.</p><p>We may add to theſe,</p><table> <row> <cell>Ivory</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>16,270</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Bone</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>5,250</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Horn</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>8.750</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Whalebone</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>7,500</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Tooth of ſea-calf</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>4,075</cell> </row> </table><p>The reader will surely obſerve, that theſe numbers express ſomething more than the utmoſt coheſion ; for the weights are ſuch as will very quickly, that is, in a minute or two, tear the rods aſunder. It may be laid in general, that two-thirds of theſe weights will ſenſibly impair the ſtrength after a conſiderable while, and that one half is the utmoſt that can remain ſuſpended at them without risk for ever ; and it is this laſt allotment that the enginter ſhould reckon upon in his conſtructions. There is,however, conſiderable difference in this reſpect. Woods of a very ſtraight fibre, ſuch as fir, will be leſs impaired by any load which is not sufficient to break them immediately.</p><p>According to Mr Emerſon, the load which may be ſafely ſuſpended to an inch ſquare is as follows :</p><table> <row> <cell>Iron</cell> <cell>76,400</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Braſs</cell> <cell><hi rend="smallcaps">35,600</hi></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Hempen rope</cell> <cell>19,600</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Ivory</cell> <cell>15,700</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Oak, box, yew, plum-tree</cell> <cell>7,850</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Elm, aſh, beech</cell> <cell>6,070</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Walnut, plum</cell> <cell>5,360</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Red fir, holly, elder, plane, crab</cell> <cell>5,000</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Cherry, hazle</cell> <cell>4,760</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Alder, aſp, birch, willow</cell> <cell>4,290</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Lead</cell> <cell>430</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Freeſtone</cell> <cell>914</cell> </row> </table><p>He gives us a practical rule, that a cylinder whoſe diameter is <hi rend="italic">d</hi> inches, loaded to one-fourth of its abſolute ſtrength, will carry as follows ;</p><table> <row> <cell>Iron</cell> <cell>135</cell> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell><p>Good rope</p><p>Oak</p></cell> <cell><p>22</p><p>14</p></cell> <cell>Cwt.</cell> </row> <row> <cell>Fir</cell> <cell>9</cell> <cell/> </row> </table><p>The rank which the different woods hold in this list of Mr Emerſon’s is very different from what we find in Muschenbroek’s. But preciſe meaſures muſt not be expected in this matter. It is wonderful that in a matter of ſuch unqueſtionable importance the public has not enabled ſome perſons of judgment to make proper trials. They are beyond the abilities of private persons.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bodies may be crushed.</hi></p><p>It is of equal, perhaps greater, importance to know the ſtrain which may be laid on ſolid bodies without danger of cruſhing them. Pillars and poſts of all kinds are expoſed to this ſtrain in its ſimpleſt form ; and there are caſes where the ſtrain is enormous, viz. where it ariſes from the oblique poſition of the parts ; as in the stuts, braces, and trusses, which occur very frequently in our great works.</p><p>It is therefore moſt deſirable to have ſome general knowledge of the principle which determines the ſtrength of bodies in oppoſition to this kind of ſtrain. But unfortunately we are much more at a loſs in this than in the laſt case. The mechaniſm of nature is much more complicated in the preſent cafe. It muſt be in ſome circuitous way that compreſſion can have any tendency to tear aſunder the parts of a ſolid body, and it is very diſſicult to trace the ſteps.</p><p>If we ſuppoſe the particles inſuperably hard and in contact, and diſpoſed in lines which are in the direction of the external preſſures, it does not appear how any pressure can diſunite the particles ; but this is a gratuitous ſuppoſition. There are infinite odds againſt this preciſe arrangement of the lines of particles ; and the compreſſibilſty of all kinds of matter in ſome degree ſhows that the particles are in a ſituation equivalent to diſtance. This being the caſe. and the particles, with their intervals, or what is equivalent to in-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0018.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0012"/>
tervals, being in ſituations that are oblique with reſpect to the preſſures, it muſt follow, that by ſqueezing them together in one direction, they are made to bulge out or ſeparate in other directions. This may proceed ſo far that ſome may be thus puſhed laterally beyond their limits of coheſion. The moment that this happens the reſiſtance to compreſſion is diminiſhed, and the body will now be cruſhed together. We may form ſome notion of this by ſuppoſing a number of ſpherules, like ſmall ſhot, sticking together by means of a cement. Compreſſing this in ſome particular direction cauſes the ſpherules to act among each other like ſo many wedges, each tending to penetrate through between the three which lie below it : and this is the ſimpleſt, and perhaps the only diſtinct, notion we can have of the matter. We have reaſon to think that the conſtitution of very homogeneous bodies, ſuch as glaſs, is not very different from this. The particles are certainly arranged ſymmetrically in the angles of ſome regular ſolids. It is only ſuch an arrangement that is conſiſtent with tranſparency, and with the free paſſage of light in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> direction.</p><p>If this be the conſtitution of bodies, it appears probable that the ſtrength, or the reſiſtance which they are capable of making to an attempt to cruſh them to pieces, is proportional to the area of the ſection whose plane is perpendicular to the external force ; for each particle being ſimilarly and equally acted on and refilled, the whole reſiſtance muſt be as their number ; that is, as the extent of the ſection.</p><p>Accordingly this principle is assumed by the few writers who have conſidered this ſubject ; but we confess that it appears to us very doubtful. Suppoſe a number of brittle or friable balls lying on a table uniformly arranged, but not cohering nor in contact, and that a board is laid over them and loaded with a weight ; we have no heſitation in saying, that the weight neceſſary to cruſh the whole collection is proportional to their number or to the area of the section. But when they are in contact (and still more if they cohere), we imagine that the case is materially altered. Any individual ball is cruſhed only in conſequence of its being bulged outwards in the direction perpendicular to the preſſure employed. If this could be prevented by a hoop put round the ball like an equator, we cannot see how any force can cruſh it. Any thing therefore which makes this bulging outwards more difficult, makes a greater force necessary. Now this effect will be produced by the mere contact of the balls before the pressure is applied ; for the central ball cannot ſwell outward laterally without puſhing away the balls on all sides of it. This is prevented by the friction on the table and upper board, which is at leaſt equal to one third of the preſſure. Thus any interior ball becomes ſtronger by the mere vicinity of the others ; and if we farther ſuppoſe them to cohere laterally, we think that its ſtrength will be ſtill more increaſed.</p><p>The analogy between theſe balls and the cohering particles of a friable body is very perfect. We ſhould therefore expect that the ſtrength by which it reſiſts being cruſhed will increase in a greater ratio than that of the ſection, or the ſquare of the diameter of ſimilar ſections ; and that a ſquare inch of any matter will bear a greater weight in proportion as it makes a part of a greater ſection. Accordingly this appears in many experiments, as will be noticed afterwards. Muſchenbroek, Euler, and ſome others, have ſupposed the ſtrength of columns to be as the biquadrates of their diameters. But Euler deduced this from formulae which occurred to him in the courſe of his algebraic analyſis ; and he boldly adopts it as a principle, without looking for its foundation in the phyſical aſſumptions which he had made in the beginning of his inveſtigation. But ſome of his original aſſumptions were as paradoxical, or at leaſt as gratuitous, as theſe reſults : and thoſe, in particular, from which this proportion of the ſtrength of columns was deduced, were almoſt foreign to the case ; and therefore the inference was of no value. Yet it was received as a principle by Muſchenbroek and by the academicians of St Peterſburgh. We make theſe very few obſervations, becauſe the ſubject is of great practical importance ; and it is a great obſtacle to improvements when deference to a great name, joined to incapacity or indolence, cauſes authors to adopt his careleſs reveries as principles from which they are afterwards to draw important conſequences. It muſt be acknowledged that we have not as yet eſtabliſhed the relation between the dimenſions and the ſtrength of a pillar on ſolid mechanical principles. Experience plainly contradicts the general opinion, that the ſtrength is proportional to the area of the ſection ; but it is ſtill more inconſiſtent with the opinion, that it is in the quadruplicate ratio of the diameters of ſimilar ſections. It would ſeem that the ratio depends much on the internal ſtructure of the body ; and experiment ſeems the only method for aſcertaining its general laws.</p><p>If we ſuppoſe the body to be of a fibrous texture, having the fibres situated in the direction of the preſſure, and ſlightly adhering to each other by ſome kind of cement, ſuch a body will fail only by the bending of the fibres, by which they will break the cement and be detached from each other. Something like this may be ſuppoſed in wooden pillars. In ſuch. caſes, too, it would appear that the reſiſtance muſt be as the number of equally reſiſting fibres, and as their mutual ſupport, jointly ; and, therefore, as ſome function of the area of the ſection. The ſame thing muſt happen if the fibres are naturally crooked or undulated, as is obſerved in many woods, &amp;c. provided we suppoſe ſome similarity in their form. Similarity of ſome kind muſt always be ſuppoſed, otherwiſe we need never aim at any general inferences.</p><p>In all caſes therefore we can hardly refuſe admitting that the ſtrength in opposition to compreſſion is proportional to a function of the area of the ſection.</p><p>As the whole length of a cylinder or priſm is equally preſſed, it does not appear that the ſtrength of a pillar is at all affected by its length. If indeed it be ſuppoſed to bend under the preſſure, the caſe is greatly changed, becauſe it is then expoſed to a tranſverſe ſtrain ; and this increaſes with the length of the pillar. But this will be conſidered with due attention under the next claſs of ſtrains.</p><p>Few experiments have been made on this ſpecies of ſtrength and ſtrain. Mr Petit ſays, that his experiments, and thoſe of Mr Parent, ſhow that the force neceſſary for cruſhing a body is nearly equal to that which will tear it aſunder. He ſays that it requires ſomething more than 60 pounds on every ſquare line to cruſh a piece of ſound oak. But the rule is by no means general : Glaſs, for inſtance, will carry a hundred times as much as oak in this way, that is, reſting on if; but will not <hi rend="italic">ſuſpend,</hi> above four or five times as much. Oak will ſulpend a great deal more than fir ; but fir will carry twice as much as a pillar. Woods of a ſoft texture, although confiding of very tenacious fibres, are more easily cruſhed by their load. This ſoftneſs of texture is chiefly owing to their fibres not being ſtraight but undulated, and there being conſiderable vacuities between them, ſo that they are easily bent laterally and cruſhed. When a poll is overſtrained by its load, it is obſerved to ſwell. ſensibly in diameter. Increasing the load cauſes longitudinal cracks or ſhivers to appear, and it preſently after gives way. This is called <hi rend="italic">crippling.</hi></p><p>In all caſes where the fibres lie oblique to the ſtrain the ſtrength is greatly diminiſhed, because the parts can then be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0019.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0013"/>
made to slide on each other, when the coheſion of the cementing matter is overcome.</p><p>Muſchenbroek has given ſome experiments on this ſubject; but they are cases of long pillars, and therefore do not belong to this place. They will be conſidered afterwards.</p><p>The only experiments of which we have ſeen any detail (and it is uſeless to inſert mere aſſertions) are thoſe of Mr Gauthey, in the 4th volume of Rozier’s <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique.</hi> This engineer expoſed to great preſſures ſmall rectangular parallelopipeds, cut from a great variety of ſtones, and noted the weights which cruſhed them. The following table exhibits the medium reſults of many trials on two very uniform kinds of freeſtone, one of them among the hardeſt and the other among the ſofteſt uſed in building.</p><p>Column 1st expreſſes the length AB of the ſection in French lines or 13ths of an inch ; column 2d expreſſes the breadth BC ; column 3d is the area of the ſection in ſquare lines ; column 4th is the number of ounces required to cruſh the piece ; column 5th is the weight which was then borne by each ſquare line of the ſection ; and column 6th is the round numbers to which Mr Gauthey imagines that thoſe in column 5th approximate.</p><table> <row> <cell/> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>Hard Stone.</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>AB</cell> <cell>BC</cell> <cell>AB×BC</cell> <cell>Weight</cell> <cell>Force</cell> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell>I</cell> <cell>8</cell> <cell>8</cell> <cell>64</cell> <cell>736</cell> <cell>11,5</cell> <cell>12</cell> </row> <row> <cell>2</cell> <cell>8</cell> <cell>I 2</cell> <cell>96</cell> <cell>2625</cell> <cell>27,3</cell> <cell>24</cell> </row> <row> <cell>3</cell> <cell>8</cell> <cell>16</cell> <cell>128</cell> <cell>4496</cell> <cell>35,1</cell> <cell>36</cell> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell/> <cell/> <cell>Soft Stone.</cell> <cell/> <cell/> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell>4</cell> <cell>9</cell> <cell>16</cell> <cell>144</cell> <cell>560</cell> <cell>3’9</cell> <cell>4</cell> </row> <row> <cell>5</cell> <cell>9</cell> <cell>18</cell> <cell>162</cell> <cell>848</cell> <cell>5’3</cell> <cell>4,5</cell> </row> <row> <cell>6</cell> <cell>18</cell> <cell>18</cell> <cell>324</cell> <cell>2928</cell> <cell>9</cell> <cell>9</cell> </row> <row> <cell>7</cell> <cell>18</cell> <cell>24</cell> <cell>432</cell> <cell>5296</cell> <cell>12,2</cell> <cell>12</cell> </row> </table><p>Little can be deduced from theſe experiments: The 1st and 3d, compared with the 5th and 6th, ſhould furniſh ſimilar reſults; for the lſt and 5th are reſpectively half of the 3d and 6th : but the 3d is three times ſtronger (that is, a line of the 3d) than the first, whereas the 6th is only twice as strong as the 5th.</p><p>It is evident, however, that the ſtrength increaſes much faster than the area of the ſection, and that a ſquare line can carry more and more weight, according as it makes a part of a larger and larger ſection. In the ſeries of experiments on the ſoft ſtone, the individual ſtrength of a ſquare line ſeems to increaſe nearly in the proportion of the ſection of which it makes a part.</p><p>Mr Gauthey deduces, from the whole of his numerous experiments, that a pillar of hard ſtone of Givry, whoſe ſection is a ſquare foot, will bear with perfect ſafety 664,000 pounds, and that its extreme ſtrength is 871,000, and the ſmallest strength obſerved in any of his experiments was 460,000. The ſoft bed of Givry ſtone had for its ſmalleſt ſtrength 187,000, for its greateſt 311,000, and for its ſafe load 249,000. Good brick will carry with ſafety 320,00s ; chalk will carry only 9000. The boldeſt piece of architecture in this reſpect which he has ſeen is a pillar in the church of All-Saints at Angers. It is 24 feet long and 11 inches ſquare, and is loaded with 60,000, which is not 1/7th of what is neceſſary for cruſhing it.</p><p>We may obſerve here by the way, that Mr Gauthey’s measure of the suspending ſtrength of ſtone is vaſtly ſmall in proportion to its power of ſupporting a load laid above it. He finds that a priſm of the hard bed of Givry, of a foot ſection, is torn aſunder by 4600 pounds ; and if it be firmly fixed horizontally in a wall, it will be broken by a weight of 56,000 suſpended a foot from the wall. If it reſt on two props at a foot diſtance, it will be broken by 206,000 laid on its middle. Theſe experiments agree so ill with each other, that little use can be made of them. The ſubject is of great importance, and well deferves the attention of the patriotic philosopher.</p><p>A ſet of good experiments would be very valuable, becauſe it is againſt this kind of ſtrain that we muſt guard by judicious conſtruction in the moſt delicate and difficult problems which come through the hands of the civil and military engineer. The conſtruction of ſtone arches, and the conſtruction of great wooden bridges, and particularly the conſtruction of the frames of carpentry called <hi rend="italic">centres</hi> in the erection of ſtone bridges, are the moſt difficult jobs that occur. In the centres on which the arches of the bridge of Orleans were built ſome of the pieces of oak were carrying upwards of two tons on every square inch of their ſcantling. All who ſaw it ſaid that it was not able to carry the fourth part of the intended load. But the engineer underſtood the principles of his art, and ran the riſk : and the reſult completely juſtified his confidence ; for the centre did not complain in any part, only it was found too ſupple ; ſo that it went out of ſhape while the haunches only of the arch were laid on it. The engineer corrected this by loading it at the crown, and thus kept it completely in ſhape during the progreſs of the work.</p><p>In the Memoirs (old) of the Academy of Peterſburgh for 1778, there is a diſſertation by Euler on this ſubject, but particularly limited to the ſtrain on columns, in which the bending is taken into the account. Mr Fuſs has treated the same ſubject with relation to carpentry in a ſubſequent volume. But there is little in theſe papers beſides a dry mathematical disquiſition, proceeding on aſſumptions which (to ſpeak favourably) are extremely gratuitous. The moſt important consequence of the compreſſion is wholly overlooked, as we ſhall preſently ſee. Our knowledge of the mechaniſm of coheſion is as yet far too imperfect to entitle us to a confident application of mathematics. Experiments ſhould be multiplied.</p><p>The only way we can hope to make theſe experiments uſeful is to pay a careful attention to the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> in which the fracture is produced. By diſcovering the general reſemblances in this particular, we advance a ſtep in our power of introducing mathematical meaſurement. Thus, when a cubical piece of chalk is ſlowly cruſhed between the chaps of a vice, we see it uniformly ſplit in a ſurface oblique to the preſſure, and the two parts then slide along the ſurface of fracture. This ſhould lead us to examine mathematically what relation there is between this ſurface of fracture and the neceſſary force ; then we ſhould endeavour to determine experimentally the poſition of this ſurface. Having diſcovered ſome general law or reſemblance in this circumstance, we ſhould try what mathematical hypotheſis will agree with this. Having found one, we may then apply our ſimpleſt notions of coheſion, and compare the reſult of our computations with experiment. We are authorised to ſay, that a ſeries of experiments have been made in this way, and that their reſults have been very uniform, and therefore ſatisfactory, and that they will ſoon be laid before the public as the foundations of succeſsful practice in the conſtruction of arches.</p><p>III. A <hi rend="smallcaps">Body may be broken across.</hi></p><p>The moſt usual, and the greateſt ſtrain, to which materials are expoſed, is that which tends to break them tranſeverſely. It is ſeldom, however, that this is done in a manner perfectly ſimple ; for when a beam projects horizontally from a wall, and a weight is ſuſpended from its extremity, the beam is commonly broken near the wall, and the intermediate part has performed the functions of a lever. It ſometimes, though rarely, happens that the pin in the joint of a pair of pincers or ſcissars is cut through by the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0020.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0014"/>
ſtrain ; and this is almoſt the only case of a simple transverſe fracture. Being ſo rare, we may content ourſelves with saying, that in this caſe the ſtrength of the piece is proportional to the area of the ſection.</p><p>Experiments were made for discovering the reſiſtances made by bodies to this kind of ſtrain in the following manner : Two iron bars were diſpoſed horizontally at an inch diſtance; a third hung perpendicularly between them, being supported by a pin made of the ſubſtance to be examined. This pin was made of a priſmatic form, ſo as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars, which were made very exact, and of the ſame ſize and ſhape. A ſcale was ſuſpended at the lower end of the perpendicular bar, and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin which filled the middle hole. This weight was evidently the meaſure of the lateral coheſion of two ſections. The side-bars were made to graſp the middle bar pretty strongly between them, that there might be no diſtance impoſed between the oppoſite preſſures. This would have combined the energy of a lever with the purely tranſverſe presſure. For the ſame reaſon it was neceſsary that the internal parts or the holes ſhould be no ſmaller than the edges. Great irregularities occurred in our firſt experiments from this cauſe, becauſe the pins were ſomewhat tighter within than at the edges ; but when this was corrected they were extremely regular. We employed three ſets of holes, viz. a circle, a ſquare (which was occaſionally made a rectangle whoſe length was twice its breadth), and an equilateral triangle. We found in all our experiments the ſtrength exactly proportional to the area of the ſection, and quite independent of its figure or poſition, and we found it conſiderably above the direct coheſion ; that is, it took considerably more than twice the force to tear out this middle piece than to tear the pin aſunder by a direct pull. A piece of fine freeſtone required 205 pounds to pull it directly aſunder, and 575 to break it in this way. The difference was very confiant in any one ſubſtance, but varied from 4/3ds to 6/3ds in different kinds of matter, being ſmalleſt in bodies of a fibrous texture. But indeed we could not make the trial on any bodies of conſiderable coheſion, becauſe they required ſuch forces as our apparatus could not ſupport. Chalk, clay baked in the ſun, baked ſugar, brick, and freeſtone, were the ſtrongeſt that we could examine.</p><p>But the more common caſe, where the energy of a lever intervenes, demands a minute examination.</p><p>Let DABC (fig. 5. n⁰ 1.) be a vertical ſection of a priſmatic ſolid (that is, of equal ſize throughout), projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed ; and let a weight P be hung on it at B, or let any power P act at B in a direction perpendicular to AB. Suppoſe the body of inſuperable ſtrength in every part except in the vertical ſection DA, perpendicular to its length. It muſt break in this ſection only. Let the coheſion be uniform over the whole of this ſection ; that is, let each of the adjoining particles of the two parts cohere with an equal force <hi rend="italic">f.</hi></p><p>There are two ways in which it may break. The part ABCD may ſimply slide down along the ſurface of fracture, provided that the power acting at B is equal to the accumulated force which is exerted by every particle of the ſection in the direction AD.</p><p>But ſuppoſe this effectually prevented by ſomething that ſupports the point A. The action at P tends to make the body turn round A (or round a horizontal line paſſing thro’ A at right angles to AB) as round a joint. This it cannot do without ſeparating at the line DA. In this caſe the adjoining particles at D or at E will be ſeparated horizontally. But their coheſion reſiſts this ſeparation. In order, therefore, that the fracture may happen, the energy or momentum of the power P, acting by means of the lever AB, muſt be ſuperior to the accumulated energies of the particles. The energy of each depends not only on its coheſive force, but alſo on its ſituation ; for the ſupposed inſuperable firmneſs of the reſt of the body makes it a lever turning round the fulcrum A, and the coheſion of each particle, ſuch as D or E, acts by means of the arm DA or EA. The energy of each particle will therefore be had by multiplying the force exerted by it in the inſtant of fracture by the arm of the lever by which it acts.</p><p>Let us therefore firſt ſuppoſe, that in the inſtant of fracture every particle is exerting an equal force f <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The energy of D will be f × DA, and that of E will be f ×EA, and that of the whole will be the ſum of all theſe products. Let the depth DA of the ſection be called d, and let any undetermined part of it EA be called x <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and then the ſpace occupied by any particle will be <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The coheſion of this ſpace may be repreſented by f <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and that of the whole by f <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The energy by which each element <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of the line DA, or d <hi rend="italic">,</hi> reſiſts the fracture, will be <hi rend="italic">fxx</hi>, and the whole accucumulated energies will be <hi rend="italic">f</hi> × <hi rend="italic">fxx.</hi> This we know to be <hi rend="italic">f</hi> × 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">,</hi> or fd <hi rend="italic">× 1/2 d.</hi> It is the ſame therefore as if the coheſion <hi rend="italic">fd</hi> of the whole ſection had been acting at the point G, which is in the middle of DA.</p><p>The reader who is not familiarly acquainted with this fluxionary calculus may arrive at the ſame conclusion in another way. Suppoſe the beam, inſtead of projecting horizontally from a wall, to be hanging from the ceiling, in which it is firmly fixed. Let us conſider how the equal coheſion of every part operates in hindering the lower part from ſeparating from the upper by opening round the joint A. The equal coheſion operates juſt as equal gravity would do, but in the oppoſite direction. Now we know, by the moſt elementary mechanics, that the effect of this will be the ſame as if the whole weight were concentrated in the centre of gravity G of the line DA, and that this point G is in the middle of DA. Now the number of fibres being as the length <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the line, and the coheſion of each fibre being = f <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the coheſion of the whole line is <hi rend="italic">f × d</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fd.</hi></p><p>The accumulated energy therefore of the coheſion in the inſtant of fracture is f <hi rend="italic">d</hi> × 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Now this muſt be equal or juſt inferior to the energy of the power employed to break it. Let the length AB be called l ; then P × <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is the correſponding energy of the power. This gives us f <hi rend="italic">d1/2 d = pl for</hi> the equation of equilibrium correſponding to the vertical ſection ADCB.</p><p>Suppoſe now that the fracture is not permitted at DA, but at another ſection ςα more remote from B. The body being priſmatic, all the vertical ſections are equal; and therefore fd½ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the ſame as before. But the energy of the power is by this means increaſed, being now = P × Bα, inſtead of P × BA : Hence we ſee that when the priſmatic body is not insuperably ſtrong in all its parts, but equally ſtrong throughout, it muſt break cloſe at the wall, where the ſtrain or energy of the power is greateſt. We ſee, too, that a power which is juſt able to break it at the wall is unable to break it anywhere elſe ; alſo an abſolute coheſion f <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which can withſtand the power p in the ſection DA, will not withſtand it in the ſection ςα, and will withſtand more in the ſection <hi rend="italic">d' a'.</hi></p><p>This teaches us to diſtinguiſh between abſolute and relative ſtrength. The relative ſtrength of a ſection has a reference to the ſtrain actually exerted on that ſection. This relative ſtrength is properly meaſured by the power which is juſt able to balance or overcome it, when applied at its<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0021.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0015"/>
proper place. Now since we nad fd1/2d = pl, we have p = (fd1/2d)/l for the meaſure of the ſtrength of the ſection DA, in relation to the power applied at B.</p><p>If the ſolid is a rectangular beam, whoſe breadth is <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> it is plain that all the vertical ſections are equal, and that AG or 1/2d is the same in all. Therefore the equation expreſſmg the equilibrium between the momentum of the external force and the accumulated momenta of coheſion will be <hi rend="italic">pl = fdb</hi> × 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p><p>The product <hi rend="italic">db</hi> evidently expreſſes the area of the ſection of fracture, which we may call s <hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> and we may expreſs the equilibrium thus, <hi rend="italic">pl = fs1/2d,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">2l : d = fs : p.</hi></p><p>Now f <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is a proper expreſſion of the abſolute coheſion of the ſection of fracture, and p is a proper meaſure of its ſtrength in relation to a power applied at B. We may therefore ſay, that <hi rend="italic">twice the length of a rectangular beam is to the depth as the abſolute coheſion to the relative strength.</hi></p><p>Since the action of equable coheſion is ſimilar to the action of equal gravity, it follows, that whatever is the figure of the ſection, the relative ſtrength will be the ſame as if the abſolute coheſion of all the fibres were acting at the centre of gravity of the ſection. Let <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be the diſtance between the centre of gravity of the ſection and the axis of fracture, we ſhall have <hi rend="italic">pl = fsg,</hi> and l : <hi rend="italic">g = fs : p.</hi> It will be very uſeful to recollect this analogy in words : “ <hi rend="italic">The length of a prſmatic beam of any ſhape is to the height of the centre of gravity above the lower ſide, as the abſolute coheſion to the strength relative to this length.”</hi></p><p>Becauſe the relative ſtrength of a rectangular beam is (fdb1/2d)/l or fdb <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /2l, it follows that the relative ſtrengths of different beams are proportional to the abſolute coheſion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the ſquare of the depth directly, and to the length inverſely ; alſo in priſms whole ſections are ſimilar, the ſtrengths are as the cubes of the diameters.</p><p>Such are the more general reſults of the mechaniſm of this tranſverſe ſtrain, in the hypotheſis that all the particles are exerting equal forces in the inſtant of fracture. We are indebted for this doctrine to the celebrated Galileo ; and it was one of the firſt ſpecimens of the application of mathematics to the ſcience of nature.</p><p>We have not included in the preceding inveſtigation that action of the external force by which the ſolid is drawn ſidewiſe, or tends to slide along the ſurface of fracture. We have ſupposed a particle E to be pulled only in the direction E e?, perpendicular to the ſection of fracture, by the action of the crooked lever BAE. But it is alſo pulled in the direction EA; and its reaction is in fame direction ε E, compounded of ε <hi rend="italic">f</hi> by which it reſiſts being pulled outwards ; and εe, by which it reſiſts being pulled downwards. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the force εe, and only know that their accumulated ſum is equal to the force p.· but in all important caaes which occur in practice, it is unneceſſary to attend to this force ; becauſe it is ſo small in companion of the forces in the direction E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as we eaſily conclude from the uſual ſmallneſs of AD in compariſon of AB.</p><p>The hypotheſis of equal coheſion, exerted by all the particles in the inſtant of fracture, is not conformable to nature: for we know, that when a force is applied tranſverſely at B, the beam is bent downwards, becoming convex on the upper side ; that side is therefore on the ſtretch. The particles at D are farther removed ſrom each other than thoſe at E, and are therefore <hi rend="italic">actually exerting</hi> greater cohesive forces, We cannot ſay with certainty and preciſion in what proportion each fibre is extended. It ſeems most probable that the extenſions are proportional to the diſtances from A. We ſhall ſuppoſe this to be really the case. Now recollect the general law which we formerly ſaid was <hi rend="italic">obſerved</hi> in all moderate extenſions, viz. that the attractive forces exerted by the dilated particles were proportional to their dilatations. Suppoſe now that the beam is so much bent that the particles at D are exerting their utmoſt force, and that this fibre is juſt ready to break or actually breaks. It is plain that a total fracture must immediately enſue ; becauſe the force which was ſuperior to the full coheſion of the particle at D, and a certain portion of the coheſion of all the reſt, will be more than superior to the full coheſion of the particle next within D, and a ſmaller portion of the coheſion of the remainder.</p><p>Now let F repreſent, as before, the full force of the exterior fibre D, which is exerted by it in the inſtant of its breaking, and then the force exerted at the ſame inſtant by the fibre E will be had by this analogy AD : AE, or d : x = f : fx/d <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the force really exerted by the fibre E is f × x/d.</p><p>The force exerted by a fibre whoſe thickneſs is <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is therefore fxx/d, but this force reſiſts the ſtrain by acting</p><p>by means of the lever EA or <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Its energy or momentum is therefore fx <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x/d, and the accumulated momenta of all the fibres in the line AE will be f × sum of x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x/d.</p><p>This, when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is taken equal to <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> will expreſs the momentum of the whole fibres in the line AD. This, therefore, is f(1/3d <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> /d), or f×1/3d <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or fd × 1/3d. Now f <hi rend="italic">d</hi> expreſſes the abſolute coheſion of the whole line AD. The accumulated momentum is therefore the ſame as if the abſolute coheſion of the whole line were exerted at 1/3d of AD from A.</p><p>From these premiſes it follows that the equation expreſsing the equilibrium of the ſtrain and coheſion is <hi rend="italic">pl = fd</hi> × 1/3 <hi rend="italic">d ;</hi> and hence we deduce the analogy, “ As <hi rend="italic">thrice the length is to the depth, ſo is the abſolute coheſion to the relative strength."</hi></p><p>This equation and this proportion will equally apply to rectangular beams whoſe breadth <hi rend="italic">is b ;</hi> for we ſhall then have pl = fbd × 1/3d.</p><p>We alſo ſee that the relative ſtrength is proportional to the abſolute coheſion of the partcles, to the breadth, and to the ſquare of the depth directly, and to the length inverſely : for p is the meaſure of the force with which it is reſiſted, and <hi rend="italic">p = (fbd1/3d)/l, = fbd</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">/3l.</hi> In this reſpect therefore this hypotheſis agrees with the Galilean; but it aſſigns to every beam a ſmaller proportion of the absolute coheſions of the ſection of fracture, in the proportion of 3 to 2. In the Galilean hypotheſis this ſection has a momentum equal to 1/2 of its abſolute ſtrength, but in the other hypotheſis it is only 1/3d. In beams of a different form the proportion may be different.</p><p>As this is a moſt important propoſition, and the foundation of many practical maxims, we are anxious to have it clearly comprehended, and its evidence perceived by all. Our better informed readers will therefore indulge us while we endeavour to preſent it in another point of view, where it will be better ſeen by thoſe who are not familiarly acquainted with the fluxionary calculus,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0022.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0016"/>

It is evident that D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is to E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as AD to AE; and therefore ſince the forces exerted by the different fibres are as their extenſion, and their extension as their diſtances from the axis of fracture) E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> will repreſent the force actually exerted by the fibre in E, while D is exerting its full force D <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> In like manner, the plane F F f f expreſſes the coheſion exerted by all the fibres in the line F F, and ſo on through the whole ſurface. Therefore the pyramid <hi rend="italic">d a a</hi> D expreſſes the accumulated exertion of the whole ſurface of fracture.</p><p>Farther, suppoſe the beam to be held perpendicular to the horizon with the end B uppermoſt, and that the weight of the priſm contained between the two ſections <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a' d a'</hi> (now horizontal) is just able to overcome the full coheſion of the ſection of fracture. The weight of the pyramid d D <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> will alſo be juſt able to overcome the coheſions actu <hi rend="italic">ally exerted</hi> by the different fibres in the inſtant of fracture, becauſe the weight of each fibre, ſuch as E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> is juſt ſuperior to the coheſion actually exerted at E.</p><p>Let o be the centre of gravity of the pyramidal ſolid, and draw <hi rend="italic">o</hi> O perpendicular to the plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The whole weight of the ſolid <hi rend="italic">d</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> may be conceived as accumulated in the point o, and as acting on the point O, and it will have the ſame tendency to ſeparate the two cohering ſurfaces as when each fibre is hanging by its respective point. For this reaſon the point O may be called the <hi rend="italic">centre of actual effort</hi> of the unequal forces of coheſion. The momentum therefore, or energy by which the cohering ſurfaces are ſeparated, will be properly meaſured by the weight of the ſolid d D <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> multiplied by OA ; and this product is equal to the product of the weight <hi rend="italic">f</hi> multiplied by BA, or by l. Thus ſuppoſe that the coheſion along the line AD only is conſidered. The whole coheſion will be repreſented by a triangle. A D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> D d repreſents <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and AD is <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and AD is <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Therefore A D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is 1/2f <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The centre of gravity o of the triangle A D J is in the interſection of a line drawn from A to the middle of D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> with a line drawn from <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to the middle of AD ; and therefore the line <hi rend="italic">o O</hi> will make AO <hi rend="underline">—</hi> 2/3 of A D. Therefore the actual momentum of coheſion is f × 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d × 2/3d, = f × d × 1/3d, = fd × 1/3d,</hi> or equal to the abſolute coheſion acting by means of the lever d/3. If the ſection of fracture is a rectangle, as in a common joiſt, whoſe breadth <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> is = <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> it is plain that all the vertical lines will be equal to AD, and their coheſions will be repreſented by triangles like A D <hi rend="italic">d ;</hi> and the whole actual coheſion will be repreſented by a wedge whoſe baſes are vertical planes, and which is equal to half of the parallelopiped AD ×D <hi rend="italic">d × a a,</hi> and will therefore be = 1/2fbd and the diſtance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line A A' will be 2/3 of A D, The momentum of coheſion of a joiſt will therefore be 1/2f <hi rend="italic">bd</hi> × 2/3 <hi rend="italic">d, or fbd</hi> × <hi rend="italic">1/3d,</hi> as we have determined in the other way.</p><p>The beam repreſented in the figure is a triangular priſm. The pyramid D <hi rend="italic">a a d</hi> is 1/3 of the priſm <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">d a' a'.</hi> If we make s repreſent the ſurface of the triangle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the pyramid is 1/3 of f <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> The diſtance AO of its centre of gravity from the horizontal line A A' is 1/2 of A D, or 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Therefore the momentum of actual coheſion is 1/3fs <hi rend="italic">× 1/2d, = fs</hi> × 1/6 <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> that is, it is the ſame as if the full coheſion of all, the fibres were accumulated at a point I whoſe diſtance from A is 1/6th of AD or d, or (that we may ſee its value in every point of view) it is 1/6th of the momentum of the full coheſion of all the fibres when accumulated at the point D, or acting at the diſtance <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = A D.</p><p>This is a very convenient way of conceiving the momentum of actual coheſion, by comparing it with the momentum of abſolute coheſion applied at the diſtance AD from the axis of fracture. The momentum of the abſolute coheſion applied at D is to the momentum of actual coheſion in the inſtant of fracture as AD to AI. Therefore the length of AI, or its proportion to AD, is a sort of index of the strength of the beam. We ſhall call it the <hi rend="smallcaps">Index,</hi> and expreſs it by the ſymbol <hi rend="italic">i.</hi></p><p>Its value is eaſily obtained. The product of the abſolute coheſion by AI must be equal to that of the actual coheſion by AO. Therefore ſay, “ as the priſmatic ſolid <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">d d a'</hi> is to the pyramidal ſolid <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> so is AO to A I.” We are aſſiſted in this determination by a very convenient circumſtance. In this hypotheſis of the actual coheſions being as the diſtances of the fibres from A, the point O is the centre of oſcillation or percuſſion of the ſurface D <hi rend="italic">a a</hi> turning round the axis <hi rend="italic">a a:</hi> for the momentum of coheſion of the line FF is FF × Ff × EA = FF×E A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, becauſe Ff is equal to E A. Now AO, by the nature of the centre of gravity, is equal to the ſum of all theſe momenta divided by the pyramid a <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; that is, by the ſum of all the FF × Ff that is, by the ſum of all the FF×E A. Therefore AO = (ſum of FF × E A <hi rend="superscript"> 2)</hi> /(sum of FF × EA), which is just the value of the diſtance of the centre of percuſſion of the triangle <hi rend="italic">a a D</hi> from A: (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotation).</hi> Moreover, if G be the centre of gravity of the triangle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we ſhall have D A to G A as the abſolute coheſion to the ſum of the coheſions actually exerted in the inſtant of fracture ; for, by the nature of this centre of gravity, A G is equal to (ſum of FF × EA), and the sum of FF × AG is equal to the ſum of FF × EA. But the ſum of all the lines F F is the triangle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the ſum of all the F F × E A is the ſum of all the rectangles F ff that is, the pyramid <hi rend="italic">d</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a a.</hi> Therefore a priſm whoſe baſe is the triangle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and whoſe height is AG, is equal to the pyramid, or will expreſs the ſum of the actual coheſions ; and a priſm, whoſe baſe is the ſame triangle, and whoſe height is D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> or D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> expreſſes the abſolute coheſion. Therefore D A is to G A as the abſolute coheſion to the ſum of the actual coheſions.</p><p>Therefore we have DA:GA = OA:IA.</p><p>Therefore, whatever be the form of the beam, that is, whatever be the figure of its ſection, find the centre of oſcillation O, and the centre of gravity G of this ſection.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0023.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0017"/>
Call their diſtances from the axis of fracture <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Then AI or i = og/d, and the momentum of coheſion is f <hi rend="italic">s × og/d</hi>, where s is the area of fracture.</p><p>This index is eaſily determined in all the cases which generally occur in practice. In a rectangular beam AI is 1/3d of AD ; in a cylinder (circular or elliptic) AI is 5/10ths of AD, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><p>In this hypotheſis, that the coheſion actually exerted by each fibre is as its extension, and that the extenſions of the fibres are as their diſtances from A (fig. 5. n⁰ 1.), it is plain that the forces exerted by the fibres D, E, &amp;c. will be repreſented by the ordinates D d <hi rend="italic">,</hi> E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> &amp;c. to a ſtraight line A <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> And we learn from the principles of <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotation</hi> that the centre of percuſſion O is in the ordinate which paſſes through the centre of gravity of the triangle A D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> or (if we conſider the whole ſection having breadth as well as depth) through the centre of gravity of the ſolid bounded by the planes DA, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> A ; and we found that this point O was the centre of effort of the coheſions <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> exerted in the inſtant of fracture, and that I was the centre of an <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> momentum, which would be produced if all the fibres were accumulated there and exerted their f <hi rend="italic">ull</hi> coheſion.</p><p>This conſideration enables us to determine, with equal facility and neatneſs, the ſtrength of a beam in any hypothesis of forces. The above hypotheſis was introduced with a cautious limitation to moderate ſtrains, which produced no permanent change of form, or no ſett as the artiſts call it : and this ſuffices for all purpoſes of practice, seeing that it would be imprudent to expoſe materials to more violent strains. But when we compare this theory with experiments in which the pieces are really broken, conſiderable deviations may be expected, becauſe it is very probable that in the vicinity of rupture the forces are no longer proportional to the extenſions.</p><p>That no doubt may remain as to the juſtneſs and completeneſs of the theory, we muſt ſhow how the relative ſtrength may be determined in any other hypotheſis. Therefore ſuppoſe that it has been eſtabliſhed by experiment on any kind of ſolid matter, that the forces actually exerted in the inſtant of fracture by the fibres at D, E, &amp;c. are as the ordinates D <hi rend="italic">d',</hi> E <hi rend="italic">e, &amp;c.</hi> of any curve line A <hi rend="italic">e' d'.</hi> We are suppoſed to know the form of this curve, and that of the solid which is bounded by the vertical plane through AD, and by the ſurface which paſſes through this curve A <hi rend="italic">e' d'</hi> perpendicularly to the length of the beam. We know the place of the centre of gravity of this curve ſurface or ſolid, and can draw a line through it parallel to AB, and cutting the ſurface of fracture in ſome point O. This point is alſo the centre of effort of all the coheſions actually exerted ; and the product of AO and of the ſolid which expresses the actual coheſions will give the momentum of coheſion equivalent to the former <hi rend="italic">fs</hi> og/d. Or we may find an index A I, by making AI a fourth proportional to the full coheſion of the ſurface of fracture, to the accumulated actual coheſions, and to AO ; and then f <hi rend="italic">s × i</hi> (=AI) will be the momentum of coheſion ; and we ſhall ſtill have I for the point in which all the fibres may be fuppoſed to exert their full coheſion f <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and to produce a momentum of coheſion equal to the real momentum of the coheſions actually exerted, and the relative ſtrength of the beam will ſtill be p = fsi/l or fsgo/dl.</p><p>Thus, if the forces be as the ſquares of the extensions (ſtill ſuppoſed to be as the diſtances from A), the curve A e' d' will be a common parabola, having AB for its axis and AD for the tangent at its vertex. The area AD <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> will be 1/3d AD × D <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> and in the caſe of a rectangular beam, AO will be 3/4ths AD, and AI will be 1/4th of AD.</p><p>We may obſerve here in general, that if the forces actually exerted in the inſtant of fracture be as any power q AD of the diſtance from A, the index AI will be = AD/q+2 for a rectangular beam, and the momentum of coheſion will always be (ca <hi rend="italic">eteris paribus)</hi> as the breadth and as the ſquare of the depth ; nay, this will be the caſe whenever the action of the fibres D and E is expreſſed by any <hi rend="italic">ſimilar functions</hi> of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> This is evident to every reader acquainted with the fluxionary calculus.</p><p>As far as we can judge from experience, no ſimple algebraic power of the diſtance will expreſs the actual coheſions of the fibres. No curve which has either AD or AB for its tangent will suit. The obſervations which we made in the beginning ſhow, that although the curve of fig. 2. muſt be ſenſibly ſtraight in the vicinity of the points of interſection with the axis, in order to agree with our obſervations which ſhow the moderate extenſions to be as the extending forces, the curve must be concave towards the axis in all its attractive branches, becauſe it cuts it again. Therefore the curve A <hi rend="italic">e' d'</hi> of fig. 5. (n⁰ I.) muſt make a finite angle with AD or AB, and it muſt, in all probability, be alſo concave towards AD in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">d'.</hi> It may however be convex in ſome part of the intermediate arch. We have made experiments on the extenſions of different bodies, and find great diverſities in this reſpect : But in all, the moderate extenſions were as the forces, and this with great accuracy till the body took a ſett, and remained longer than formerly when the extending force was removed.</p><p>We muſt now remark, that this correction of the Galilean hypotheſis of equal forces was ſuggeſted by the bending’ which is obſerved in all bodies which are ſtrained tranſverſely. Becauſe they are bent, the fibres on the convex side have been extended. We cannot say in what proportion this obtains in the different fibres. Our moſt diſtinct notions of the internal equilibrium between the particles render it highly probable that their extenſion is proportional to their diſtance from that fibre which retains its former dimensions. But by whatever law this is regulated, we ſee plainly that the actions of the ſtretched fibres muſt follow the proportions of ſome function of this diſtance, and that therefore the relative ſtrength of a beam is in all caſes ſuſceptible of mathematical determination.</p><p>We alſo ſee an intimate connection between the ſtrain and the curvature. This ſuggeſted to the celebrated James Bernoulli the problem of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Elastic Curve;,</hi> <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the curve into which an extenſible rigid body will be bent by a tranſverſe ſtrain. His ſolution in the Acta <hi rend="italic">Lipsiae</hi> 1694 and 1695 is a very beautiful ſpecimen of mathematical diſcuſſion ; and we recommend <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to the peruſal of the curious reader. He will find <hi rend="italic">it</hi> very perſpicuouſly treated in the firſt volume of his works, publiſhed after his death, where the wide ſteps which he had taken in his inveſtigation are explained so as to be eaſily comprehended. His nephew Dan. Bernoulli has given an elegant abridgment in the Peterſburg Memoirs for 1729. The problem is too intricate to be fully diſcuſſed in a work like ours ; but it is alſo too intimately connected with our preſent ſubject to be entirely omitted. We muſt content ourſelves with ſhowing the leading mechanical property of this curve, from which the mathematician may deduce all its geometrical properties.</p><p>When a bar of uniform depth and breadth, and of a given length, is bent into an arch of a circle, the extenſion of the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0024.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0018"/>
outer fibres is proportional to the curvature ; for, becauſe the curves formed by the inner and outer ſides of the beam are ſimilar, the circumferences are as the radii, and the radius of the inner circle is to the difference of the radii as the length of the inner circumference is to the difference of the circumferences. The difference of the radii is the depth of the beam, the difference of the circumferences is the extenſion of the outer fibres, and the inner circumference is ſuppoſed to be the primitive length of the beam. Now the ſecond and third quantities of the above analogy, viz. the depth and length of the beam, are constant quantities, as is alſo their product. Therefore the product of the inner radius and the extenſion of the outer fibre is alſo a conſtant quantity, and the whole extenſion of the outer fibre is inverſely as the radius of curvature, or is directly as the curvature of the beam.</p><p>The mathematical reader will readily see, that into whatever curve the elaſtic bar is bent, the whole extenſion of the outer fibre is equal to the length of a ſimilar curve, having the ſame proportion to the thickneſs of the beam that the length of the beam has to the radius of curvature.</p><p>Now let ADCB (fig. 5. n⁰ 3.) be ſuch a rod, of uniform breadth and thickneſs, firmly fixed in a vertical position, and bent into a curve AEFB by a weight W ſuſpended at B, and of ſuch magnitude that the extremity B has its tangent perpendicular to the action of the weight, or parallel to the horizon. Suppoſe too that the extenſions are proportional to the extending forces. From any two points E and F draw the horizontal ordinates EG, FH. It is evident that the exterior fibres of the ſections E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and Ff are ſtretched by forces which are in the proportion of EG to FH (theſe being the long arms of the levers, and the equal thickneſſes E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> Ff being the ſhort arms). Therefore (by the hypotheſis) their extenſions are in the ſame proportion. But becauſe the extenſions are proportional to ſome ſimilar functions of the diſtance from the axes of fracture E and F, the extenſion of any fibre in the ſection E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is to the contemporaneous extenſion of the ſimilarly ſituated fibre in the ſection Ff, as the extenſion of the exterior fibre in the ſection E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is to the extenſion of the exterior fibre in the ſection Ff: therefore the whole extenſion of E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is to the whole extenſion of Ff as EG to FH, and EG is to FH as the curvature in E to the curvature in F.</p><p>Here let it be remarked, that this proportionality of the curvature to the extenſion of the fibres is not limited to the hypotheſis of the proportionality of the extenſions to the extending forces. It follows from the extenſion in the different ſections being as ſome ſimilar function of the diſtance from the axis of fracture ; an assumption which cannot be refuſed.</p><p>This then is the fundamental property of the elaſtic curve, from which its equation, or relation between the abſciſſa and ordinate, may be deduced in the uſual forms, and all its other geometrical properties. Theſe are foreign to our purpoſe ; and we ſhall notice only ſuch properties as have an immediate relation to the ſtrain and ſtrength of the different parts of a flexible body, and which in particular ſerve to explain ſome difficulties in the valuable experiments of Mr Buffon on the Strength of Beams.</p><p>We obſerve, in the firſt place, that the elaſtic curve cannot be a circle, but is gradually more incurvated as it recedes from the point of application B of the ſtraining forces. At B it has no curvature ; and if the bar were extended beyond B there would be no curvature there. In like manner, when a beam is ſupported at the ends and loaded in the middle, the curvature is greateſt in the middle ; but at the props, or beyond them, if the beam extend farther, there is no curvature. Therefore when a beam projecting 20 feet from a wall is bent to a certain curvature at the wall by a weight ſuſpended at the end, and a beam of the ſame ſize projecting 20 feet is bent to the very ſame curvature at the wall by a greater weight at 10 feet diſtance, the figure and the mechanical ſtate of the beam in the vicinity of the wall is different in theſe two caſes, though the curvature at the very wall is the ſame in both. In the firſt caſe every part of the beam is incurvated ; in the ſecond, all beyond the 10 feet is without curvature. In the firſt experiment the curvature at the diſtance of five feet from the wall is 3/4ths of the curvature at the wall ; in the ſecond, the curvature at the ſame place is but 1/2 of that at the wall. This muſt weaken the long beam in this whole interval of five feet, becauſe the greater curvature is the reſult of a greater extenſion of the fibres.</p><p>In the next place, we may remark, that there is a certain determinate curvature for every beam which cannot be exceeded without breaking it ; for there is a certain ſeparation of two adjoining particles that puts an end to their coheſion. A fibre can therefore be extended only a certain proportion of its length. The ultimate extenſion of the outer fibres muſt bear a certain determinate proportion to its length, and this proportion is the ſame with that of the thickneſs (or what we have hitherto called the depth) to the radius of ultimate curvature, which is therefore determinate.</p><p>A beam of uniform breadth and depth is therefore most incuryated where the ſtrain is greateſt, and will break in the moſt incurvated part. But by changing its form, so as to make the ſtrength of its different ſections in the ratio of the ſtrain, it is evident that the curvature may be the ſame throughout, or may be made to vary according to any law. This is a remark worthy of the attention of the watchmaker. The moſt delicate problem in practical mechanics is ſo to taper the balance-ſpring of a watch that its wide and narrow vibrations may be isochronous. Hooke’s principle <hi rend="italic">ut tenſio sic vis</hi> is not sufficient when we take the <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi> and motion of the ſpring itſelf into the account. The figure into which it bends and unbends has alſo an influence. Our readers will take notice that the artiſt aims at an accuracy which will not admit an error of 1/86400th, and that Harriſon and Arnold have actually attained it in ſeveral inſtances. The taper of a ſpring is at preſent a noſtrum in the hands of each artiſt, and he is careful not to impart his ſecret.</p><p>Again, ſince the depth of the beam is thus proportional to the radius of ultimate curvature, this ultimate or breaking curvature is inverſely as the depth. It may be expressed by 1/d.</p><p>When a weight is hung on the end of a priſmatic beam, the curvature is nearly as the weight and the length directly, and as the breadth and the cube of the depth inverſely ; for the ſtrength is = f(bd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /3l). Let us ſuppoſe that this produces the ultimate curvature 1/d. Now let the beam be loaded with a ſmaller weight w, and let the curvature produced be C, we have this analogy f(bd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /3l) : w = 1/d : C, and C = 3lw/fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. evident that this is alſo true of a beam ſupported at the ends and loaded between the props ; and we ſee how to determine the curvature in its different parts, whether ariſing from the load, or from its own weight, or from both.</p><p>When beam is thus loaded at the end or middle, the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0025.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0019"/>
loaded point is pulled down, and the ſpace through which it is drawn may be called the <hi rend="smallcaps">deflection.</hi> This may be conſidered as the ſubtenſe of the angle of contact, or as the verſed sine of the arch into which the beam is bent, and is therefore as the curvature when the length of the arches is given (the flexure being moderate), and as the ſquare of the length of the arch when the curvature is given. The deflection therefore is as the curvature and as the ſquare of</p><p><hi rend="italic">3lιυ</hi> the length of the arch jointly ; that is, as 3lw/fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> <hi rend="italic">× l</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">,</hi> or as 3l <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> w/fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. The deflection from the primitive ſhape is therefore as the bending weight and the cube of the length directly, and as the breadth and cube of the depth inverſely.</p><p>In beams juſt ready to break, the curvature is as the depth inverſely, and the deflection is as the ſquare of the length divided by the depth ; for the ultimate curvature at the breaking part is the ſame whatever is the length ; and in this caſe the deflection is as the ſquare of the length.</p><p>We have been the more particular in our conſideration of this ſubject, becauſe the reſulting theorems afford us the fineſt methods of examining the laws of corpuſcular action, that is, for diſcovering the variation of the force of cohesion by a change of distance. It is true it is not the atomical law, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hylarchic Principle</hi> as it may justly be called, which is thus made acceſſible, but the ſpecific law of the particles of the ſubſtance or kind of matter under examination. But even this is a very great point ; and coincidences in this reſpect among the different kinds of matter are of great moment. We may thus learn the nature of the corpuſcular action of different ſubſtances, and perhaps approach to a diſcovery of the <hi rend="italic">mechaniſm</hi> of chemical affinities. For that chemical actions are inſenſible caſes of local motion is undeniable, and local motion is the province of mechanical diſcuſſion ; nay, we see that theſe hidden changes are produced by mechanical forces in many important caſes, for we see them promoted or prevented by means purely mechanical. The converſion of bodies into elastic vapour by heat can at all times be prevented by a <hi rend="italic">ſufficient</hi> external preſſure. A ſtrong ſolution of Glauber’s ſalt will congeal in an inſtant by agitation, giving out its latent beat ; and it will remain fluid for ever, and return its latent heat in a cloſe veſſel which it completely fills. Even water will by ſuch treatment freeze in an inſtant by agitation, or remain fluid for ever by confinement. We know that heat is produced or extricated by friction, that certain compounds of gold or ſilver with ſaline matters explode with irreſiſtible violence by the ſmalleſt preſſure or agitation. Such facts ſhould rouſe the mathematical philosopher, and excite him to follow out the conjectures of the illuſtrious Newton, encouraged by the ingenious attempts of Boſcovich ; and the proper beginning of this ſtudy is to attend to the laws of attraction and repulſion exerted by the particles of cohering bodies, diſcoverable by experiments made on their actual extensions and compreſſions. The experiments of ſimple extenſions and compreſſions are quite inſufficient, becauſe the total ſtretching of a wire is ſo small a quantity, that the miſtake of the 1000th part of an inch occasions an irregularity which deranges any progreſſion ſo as to make it uſeleſs. But by the bending of bodies, a diſtenſion of 1/100th of an inch may be easily magnified in the deflection of the ſpring ten thouſand times. We know that the inveſtigation is intricate and difficult, but not beyond the reach of our preſent mathematical attainments ; and it will give very fine opportunities of employing all the addreſs of analyſis. In the laſt century and the beginning of the preſent this was a sufficient excitement to the firſt geniuſes of Europe. The cycloid, the tenana, the elaſtic curve, the velaria, the cauſtics, were reckoned an abundant recompenſe for much ſtudy ; and James Bernoulli requeſted, as an honourable monument, that the logarithmic ſpiral might be inſcribed on his tombſtone. The reward for the ſtudy to which we now preſume to incite the mathematicians is the almoſt unlimited extenſion of natural ſcience, important in every particular branch. To go no further than our preſent ſubject, a great deal of important practical knowledge reſpecting the ſtrength of bodies is derived from the single obſervation, that in the moderate extenſions which happen before the parts are overſtrained the forces are neatly in the proportion of the extenſions or ſeparations of the particles. To return to our ſubject.</p><p>James Bernoulli in his ſecound dissertation on the elaſtic curve, calls in queſtion this law, and accommodates his inveſtigation to any hypothesis concerning the relation of the forces and extenſions. He relates ſome experiments of lute ſtrings where the relation was considerably different. Strings of three feet long,</p><p>Stretched by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 pds.</p><p>Were lengthened 9, 17, 23, 27, 30 lines.</p><p>But this is a moſt exceptionable form of the experiment. The ſtrings were twiſted, and the mechaniſm of the extenſions is here exceedingly complicated, combined with compreſſions and with tranſverſe twiſts, &amp;c. We made experiments on fine slips of the gum caoutchouc, and on the juice of the berries of the white bryony, of which a single grain will draw to a thread of two feet long, and again return into a perfectly round ſphere. We meaſured the diameter of the thread by a microſcope with a micrometer, and thus could tell in every ſtate of extenſion the proportional number of particles in the ſections. We found, that though the whole range in which the diſtance of the particles was changed in the proportion of 13 to I, the extenſions did not <hi rend="italic">ſenſibly</hi> deviate from the proportion of the forces. The ſame thing was obſerved in the caoutchouc as long as it perfectly recovered its firſt dimensions. And it is on the authority of theſe experiments that we preſume to announce this as a law of nature.</p><p>Dr Robert Hooke was undoubtedly the firſt who attended to this ſubject, and affirmed this as a law of nature. Mariotte indeed was the firſt who expreſsly uſed it for determining the ſtrength of beams : this he did about the 1679, correcting the ſimple theory of Galileo. Leibnitz indeed, in his diſſertation in the <hi rend="italic">Aeta Eruditorum</hi> 1684 <hi rend="italic">de Resistentia Solidorum,</hi> introduces this conſideration, and wiſhes to be conſidered as the diſcoverer ; and he is always acknowledged as ſuch by the Bernoullis and others who adhered to his peculiar doctrines. But Marriottè had publiſhed the doctrine in the moſt expreſs terms long before ; and Bulfinger, in the <hi rend="italic">Comment. Petropol.</hi> 1729, completely vindicates his claim. But Hooke was unqueſtionably the diſcoverer of this law. It made the foundation of his theory of springs, announced to the Royal Society about the year 1661, and read in 1666. On this occasion he mentions many things on the ſtrength of bodies as quite familiar to his thoughts, which are immediate deductions from this principle ; and among theſe <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the facts which John Bernoulli ſo vauntingly adduces in ſupport of Leibnitz’s finical dogmas about the force of bodies in motion ; a doctrine which Hooke might have claimed as his own, had he not perceived its frivolous inanity.</p><p>But even with this firſt correction of Marriotte, the mechaniſm of tranſverſe ſtrain is not fully nor juſtly explained. The force acting in the direction BP (fig. 4. n⁰ 1.), and bending the body ABCD, not only ſtretches the fibres on the wide oppoſite to the axis of fracture, but compreſſes the side AB, which becomes concave by the ſtrain. Indeed it cannot do the one without doing the other: For in order.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0026.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0020"/>
to ſtretch the fibres at D, there muſt be some fulcrum, ſome ſupport, on which the virtual lever BAD may preſs, that it may tear aſunder the ſtretched fibres. This fulcrum muſt ſuſtain both the preſſure ariſing from the coheſion of the diſtended fibres, and alſo the action of the external force, which immediately tends to cauſe the prominent part of the beam to slide along the ſection DA. Let BAD (fig. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> n⁰ 1.) be conſidered as a crooked lever, of which A is the fulcrum. Let an external force be applied at B in the direction BP, and let a force equal to the accumulated coheſion of AD be applied at O in the direction oppoſite to AB, that is, perpendicular to AO ; and let theſe two forces be ſuppoſed to balance each other by the intervention of the lever. In the firſt place, the force at O muſt be to the force at B as AB to AO : Therefore, if we make AK equal and oppoſite to AO, and AL equal and oppoſite to AB, the common principles of mechanics inform us that the fulcrum A is affected in the ſame manner as if the two forces AK and AL were immediately applied to it, the force AK being equal to the weight P, and AL equal to the accumulated coheſion actually exerted in the inſtant of fracture. The fulcrum is therefore really preſſed in the direction AM, the diagonal of the parallelogram, and it muſt reſiſt in the direction and with the force MA ; and this power of reſiſtance, this ſupport, muſt be furniſhed by the repulſive forces exerted by <hi rend="italic">thoſe particles only</hi> which are in a ſtate of actual compreſſion. The force AK, which is equal to the external force P, muſt be refilled in the direction KA by the lateral coheſion of the whole particles between D and A (the particle D is not only drawn forward but downward). This prevents the part CDAB from sliding down along the ſection DA.</p><p>This is fully verified by experiment. If we attempt to break a long slip of cork, or any ſuch very compreſſible body, we always obſerve it to bulge out on the concave side before it cracks on the other side. If it is a body of fibrous or foliated texture, it ſeldom fails ſplintering off on the Concave side ; and in many cases this ſplintering is very deep, even reaching half way through the piece. In hard and granulated bodies, ſuch as a piece of freeſtone, chalk, dry clay, ſugar, and the like, we generally ſee a considerable ſplinter or ſhiver fly off from the hollow side. If the fracture be ſlowly made by a force at B gradually augmented, the formation of the ſplinter is very diſtinctly ſeen. It forms a triangular piece like aI <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which generally breaks in the middle. We doubt not but that attentive obſervation would ſhow that the direction of the crack on each side of I is not very different from the direction AM and its correſpondent on the other side; This is by no means a circumſtance of idle curioſity, but intimately connected with the mechaniſm of coheſion.</p><p>Let us ſee what conſequences reſult from this ſtate of the caſe reſpecting the ſtrength of bodies. Let D∆KC (fig. 6.) repreſent a vertical ſection of a priſm of compreſſible materials, ſuch as a piece of timber. Suppoſe it loaded with a weight P hung at its extremity. Suppoſe it of ſuch a constitution that all the fibres in AD are in a ſtate of dilatation, while thoſe in A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> are in a ſtate of compreſſion. In the inſtant of fracture the particles at D and E are withheld by forces D d, E e, and the particles at <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> and E repel, resiſt, or ſupport, with forces <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> δ, Eε.</p><p>Some line, ſuch as <hi rend="italic">deAεδ</hi> will limit all theſe ordinates, which repreſent the forces actually exerted in the inſtant of fracture. If the forces are as the extenſions and compreſsions, as we have great reason to believe, <hi rend="italic">de</hi> A and Aεδ will be two ſtraight lines. They will form <hi rend="italic">one</hi> ſtraight line <hi rend="italic">d</hi> Aδ, if the forces which reſiſt a certain dilatation are equal to the forces which reſiſt an equal compreſſion. But this is quite accidental, and is not ſtrictly true in any body. In moſt bodies which have any considerable firmneſs, the compreſſions made by any external force are not ſo great as the dilatations which the ſame force would produce ; that is, the repulſions which are excited by any ſuppoſed degree of compreſſion are greater than the attractions excited by the ſame degree of dilatation. Hence it will generally follow, that the angle d AD is leſs than the angle δA <hi rend="smallcaps">δ,</hi> and the ordinates D d, E e, &amp;c. are leſs than the correſponding ordinates <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> δ, Eε, &amp;c.</p><p>But whatever be the nature of the line <hi rend="italic">d</hi> Aδ, we are certain of this, that the whole area AD <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is equal to the whole area A∆δ <hi rend="subscript"> :</hi> for as the force at B is gradually increaſed, and the parts between A and D are more extended, and greater coheſive forces are excited, there is always ſuch a degree of repulſive forces excited in the particles between A and Δ that the one ſet preciſely balances the other. The force at B, acting perpendicularly to AB, has no tendency to puſh the whole piece cloſer on the part next the wall or to pull it away. The ſum of the attractive and repulſive forces actually excited muſt therefore be equal. Theſe ſums are repreſented by the two triangular areas, which are therefore equal.</p><p>The greater we ſuppoſe the repulſive forces correſponding to any degree of compreſſion, in companion with the attractive forces correſponding to the ſame degree of extenſion, the ſmaller will A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> be in compariſon of AD. In a piece of cork or ſponge, A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> may chance to be equal to AD, or even to exceed it ; but in a piece of marble, A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> will perhaps be very ſmall in compariſon of AD.</p><p>Now it is evident that the repulſive forces excited between A and <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> have no ſhare in preventing the fracture. They rather contribute to it, by furniſhing a fulcrum to the lever, by whoſe energy the coheſion of the particles in AD is overcome. Hence we ſee an important conſequence of the compreſſibility of the body. Its power of refilling this tranſverſe strain is diminiſhed by it, and ſo much the more diminiſhed as the stuff is more compreſſible.</p><p>This is fully verified by ſome very curious experiments made by Du Hamel. He took 16 bars of willow 2 feet long and 1/2 an inch ſquare, and ſupporting them by props under the ends, he broke them by weights hung on the middle. He broke 4 of them by weights of 40, 41, 47, and 52 pounds : the mean is 45. He then cut 4 of them 1/3d through on the upper side, and filled up the cut with a thin piece of harder wood ſtuck in pretty tight. Theſe were broken by 48, 54, 50, and 52 pounds ; the mean of which is 51. He cut other four 1/2 through, and they were broken by 47, 49, 50, 46; the mean of which is 48. The remaining four were cut 2/3ds and their mean ſtrength was 42.</p><p>A nother ſet of his experiments in ſtill more remarkable.</p><p>Six battens of willow 36 inches long and 1½ ſquare were broken by 525 pounds at a medium.</p><p>Six bars were cut 1/3d through, and the cut filled with a wedge of hard wood ſtuck in with a little force: theſe broke with 551.</p><p>Six bars were cut half through, and the cut was filled in the ſame manner : they broke with 542.</p><p>Six bars were cut 3/4ths through : theſe broke with 530.</p><p>A batten cut 3/4ths through, and loaded till nearly broken, was unloaded, and the wedge taken out of the cut. A thicker wedge was put in tight, ſo as to make the batten ſtraight again by filling up the ſpace left by the compresſion of the wood : this batten broke with 577 pounds.</p><p>From this it is plain that more than 2/3ds of the thickneſs (perhaps nearly, 3/4ths) contributed nothing to the ſtrength.</p><p>The point A is the centre of fracture in this caſe ; and</p><p>in order to eſtimate the ſtrength of the piece, we may ſup-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0027.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0021"/>
poſe that the crooked lever virtually concerned in the ſtrain is DAB. We muſt find the point I, which is the centre of effort of all the attractive forces, or that point where the full coheſion of AD muſt be applied, ſo as to have a momentum equal to the accumulated momenta of all the variable forces. We muſt in like manner find the centre of effort <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of the repulſive or ſupporting forces exerted by the fibres lying between A and <hi rend="smallcaps">δ.</hi></p><p>It is plain, and the remark is important, that this laſt centre of effort is the real fulcrum of the lever, although A is the point where there is neither extenſion nor contraction ; for the lever is ſupported in the ſame manner as it the repulsions of the whole line A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> were exerted at that point. Therefore let S repreſent the ſurface of fracture from l to D, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> repreſent the abſolute coheſion of a fibre at D in the inſtant of fracture. We ſhall have fS × I + i = pl, or l : I + i = fS : p, that is, the length AB is to the diſtance between the two centres of effort I and z, as the abſolute cohesion of the ſection between A and D is to the relative ſtrength of the ſection.</p><p>It would be perhaps more accurate to make AI and A <hi rend="italic">i</hi> equal to the diſtances of A from the horizontal lines paſſing through the centres of gravity of the triangles <hi rend="italic">d</hi> AD and δA <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi>. It is only in this conſtruction that the points I and i are the centres of real effort of the accumulated attractions and repulsions. But I and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> determined as we have done, are the points where the full, equal, actions may be all applied, ſo as to produce the ſame momenta. The final reſults are the ſame in both caſes. The attentive and duly informed reader will see that Mr Bulfinger, in a very elaborate diſſertation on the ſtrength of beams in the <hi rend="italic">Comment. Petropolitan.</hi> 1729, has committed ſeveral miſtakes in his eſtimation of the actions of the fibres. We mention this becauſe his reaſonings are quoted and appealed to as authorities by Muſchenbroek and other authors of note. The ſubject has been conſidered by many authors on the continent. We recommend to the reader’s peruſal the very minute diſcuſſions in the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris for 1702 by Varignon, the Memoirs for 1708 by Parent, and particularly that of Coulomb in the Mem. <hi rend="italic">par les Scavans Etrangers,</hi> tom. vii.</p><p>It is evident, from what has been ſaid above, that if S and s repreſent the ſurfaces of the ſections above and below A, and if G and g are the diſtances of their centres of gravity from A, and O and o the diſtances of their centres of oſcillation, and D and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> their whole depths, the momentum of coheſion will be (fS × G × O)/D + (fs × g × o)/d = pl.</p><p>If (as is moſt likely) the forces are proportional to the extenſions and compreſſions, the diſtances AI and Ai, which are reſpectively = (G × O)/D and (g × o)/d, are reſpectively = 1/3DA, and 1/3∆A ; and when taken together are = 1/3D∆. If, moreover, the extenſions are equal to the compreſſions in the inſtant of fracture, and the body is a rectangular priſm like a common joiſt or beam, then DA and ∆A are alſo equal ; and therefore the momentum of coheſion is fb × 1/2d × 1/3d, = fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /6, fbd × 1/6d = pl. Hence we obtain this analogy, “ Six times the length is to the depth as the abſolute coheſion of the ſection is to its relative ſtrength.”</p><p>Thus we ſee that the compreſſibility of bodies has a very great influence on their power of withſtanding a tranſverſe ſtrain. We ſee that in this moſt favourable ſuppoſition of equal dilatations and compreſſions, the ſtrength is reduced to one half of the value of what it would have been had the body been incompressible. This is by no means obvious ; for it does not readily appear how compreſſibility, which does not diminiſh the coheſion of a ſingle fibre, ſhould impair the ſtrength of the whole. The reaſon, however, is ſufficiently convincing when pointed out. In the inſtant of fracture a ſmaller portion of the ſection is actually exerting coheſive forces, while a part of it is only ſerving as a fulcrum to the lever, by whoſe means the ſtrain on the ſection is produced. We ſee too that this diminution of ſtrength does not ſo much depend on the ſenſible compreſſibility, as on its proportion to the dilatability by equal forces. When this proportion is ſmall, A∆ is ſmall in compariſon of AD, and a greater portion of the whole fibre is exerting attractive forces. The experiments already mentioned of Du Hamel de Monceau on battens of willow ſhow that its compreſſibiiity is nearly equal to its dilatability. But the caſe is not very different in tempered ſteel. The famous Harriſon, in the delicate experiments which he made while occupied in making his longitude watch, diſcovered that a rod of tempered ſteel was nearly as much diminished in its length as it was augmented by the ſame external force. But it is not by any means certain that this is the proportion of dilatation and compreſſion which obtains in the very inſtant of fracture. We rather imagine that it is not. The forces are nearly as the dilatations till very near breaking ; but we think that they diminiſh when the body is just going to break. But it ſeems certain that the forces which reſiſt compreſſion increaſe faſter than the compreſſions, even before fracture. We know inconteſtably that the ultimate reſiſtances to compreſſion are inſuperable by any force which we can employ. The repulſive forces therefore (in their whole extent) increaſe faſter than the compreſſions, and are expreſſed by an aſſymptotic branch of the Boſcovician curve formerly explained. It is therefore probable, especially in the more ſimple substances, that they increaſe faſter, even in ſuch compreſſions as frequently obtain in the breaking of hard bodies. We are diſpoſed to think that this is always the caſe in ſuch bodies as do not fly off in ſplinters on the concave side ; but this muſt be understood with the exception of the permanent changes which may be made by compreſſion, when the bodies are crippled by it. This always mcreaſes the compreſſion itself, and cauſes the neutral point to ſhift ſtill more towards D. The effect of this is ſometimes very great and fatal.</p><p>Experiment alone can help us to diſcover the proportion between the dilatability and compreſſibility of bodies. The ſtrain now under conſideration ſeems the beſt calculated for this reſearch. Thus if we find that a piece of wood an inch ſquare requires 12,000 pounds to tear it aſunder by a direct pull, and that 200 pounds will break it tranſverſely by acting 10 inches from the ſection of fracture, we muſt conclude that the neutral point A is in the middle of the depth, and that the attractive and repulſive forces are equal. Any notions that we can form of the conſtitution of ſuch fibrous bodies as timber, make us imagine that the <hi rend="italic">ſenſible</hi> compressions, including what ariſes from the bending up of the compreſſed fibres, is much greater than the real corpuſcular extenſions. One may get a general conviction of this unexpected proposition by reflecting on what muſt happen during the fracture. An undulated fibre can only be drawn ſtraight, and then the corpuſcular extenſion begins ; but it may be bent up by compreſſion to any degree, the corpuſcular compreſſion being little affected all the while. This obſervation is very important ; and though the forces of corpuſcular repulsion may be almost inſuperable by any compreſſion that we can employ, a s <hi rend="italic">ensible</hi> compreſſion may be produced by forces not enormous, sufficient to cripple the beam. Of this we ſhall ſee very important inſtances afterwards.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0028.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0022"/>
It deferves to be noticed, that although the relative ſtrength oſ a prismatic ſolid is extremely different in the three hypotheſes now considered, yet the proportional ſtrengths of different pieces follow the ſame ratio ; namely, the direct: ratio of the breadth, the direct ratio of the ſquare of the depth, and the inverſe ratio of the length. In the firſt hypotheſis (of equal forces) the ſtrength of a rectangular beam was fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /2l ; in the ſecond (of attractive forces proportional to the extenſions) it was fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /3l ; and in the third (equal attractions and repulſions proportional to the extenſions and compreſſions) it was fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /6l, or more generally fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /ml, where <hi rend="italic">m</hi> expreſſes the unknown proportion between the attractions and repulſions correſponding to an equal extension and compreſſion.</p><p>Hence we derive a piece of uſeful information, which is confirmed by unexcepted experience, that the ſtrength of a piece depends chiefly on its depth, that is, on that dimenſion which is in the direction of the ſtrain. A bar of timber of one inch in breadth and two inches in depth is four times as ſtrong as a bar of only one inch deep, and it is twice as ſtrong as a bar two inches broad and one deep ; that is, a joiſt or lever is always ſtrongeſt when laid on its edge.</p><p>There is therefore a choice in the manner in which the coheſion is oppoſed to the ſtrain. The general aim muſt be to put the centre of effort I as far from the fulcrum or the neutral point A as poſſible, ſo as to give the greateſt energy or momentum to the coheſion. Thus if a triangular bar projecting from a wall is loaded with a weight at its extremity, it will bear thrice as much when one of the ſides is uppermoſt as when it is undermoſt. The bar of fig. 5. n⁰ 2. would be three times as ſtrong if the side AB were uppermoſt and the edge DC undermoſt.</p><p>Hence it follows that the ſtrongeſt joiſt that can be cut out of a round tree is not the one which has the greateſt quantity of timber in it, but ſuch that the product of its breadth by the ſquare of its depth ſhall be the greateſt poſſible. Let ABCD (fig. 7.) be the lection of this joiſt inſcribed in the circle, AB being the breadth and AD the depth. Since it is a rectangular ſection, the diagonal BD is a diameter of the circle, and BAD is a right angled triangle. Let BD be called <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and BA be called <hi rend="italic">x</hi>; then AD is = V <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> z</hi> <hi rend="italic">—x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Now we muſt have AB × AD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or x × <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">—</hi> x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">x — x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> <hi rend="italic">, a</hi> maximum. Its fluxion a <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x <hi rend="italic">—3x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">x</hi> muſt be made = o, or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">=</hi> 3x <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">= a</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">/3.</hi> If therefore we make DE = 1/3DB, and draw EC perpendicular to BD, it will cut the circumference in the point C, which determines the depth BC and the breadth CD.</p><p>Becauſe BD : BC = CD : CE, we have the area of the ſection BC × CD = BD × CE. Therefore the different sections having the ſame diagonal BD are proportional to their heights CE. Therefore the ſection BCDA is leſs than the ſection B <hi rend="italic">c</hi> Da, whoſe four ſides are equal. The joiſt ſo ſhaped, therefore, is both ſtronger, lighter, and cheaper.</p><p>The ſtrength of ABCD is to that of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> B <hi rend="italic">e</hi> D as 10,000 to 9186, and the weight and expence as 10,000 to 10,607; ſo that ABCD is preferable to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> B <hi rend="italic">c</hi> D in the proportion of 10,607 to 9186, or nearly 115 to 100.</p><p>From the ſame principles it follows that a hollow tube is ſtronger than a ſolid rod containing the same quantity of matter. Let fig. 8. repreſent the ſection of a cylindric tube, of which AF and BE are the exterior and interior diameters and C the centre. Draw BD perpendicular to BC, and join DC. Then, becauſe BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = CD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — CB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, BD is the radius of a circle containing the ſame quantity of matter with the ring. If we eſtimate the ſtrength by the firſt hypotheſis, it is evident that the ſtrength of the tube will be to that of the ſolid cylinder, whoſe radius is BD, as BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × AC to BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × BD ; that is, as AC to BD : for BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> expreſſes the coheſion of the ring or the circle, and AC and BD are equal to the distances of the centres of effort (the ſame with the centres of gravity) of the ring and circle from the axis of fracture.</p><p>The proportion of theſe ſtrengths will be different in the other hypotheſes, and is not eaſily expreſſed by a general formula ; but in both it is ſtill more in favour of the ring or hollow tube.</p><p>The following very simple ſolution will be readily underſtood by the intelligent reader. Let O be the centre of oſcillation of the exterior circle, <hi rend="italic">o</hi> the centre of oſcillation of the inner circle, and w the centre of oſcillation of the ring included between them. Let M be the quantity of ſurface of the exterior circle, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> that of the inner circle, and <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> that of the ring. We have (Fw = M × FO - m × FO)/μ, = (5FC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + EC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)/4FC, and the ſtrength of the ring = (fμ × FW)/2, and the ſtrength of the ſame quantity of matter in the form of a ſolid cylinder is fμ × 5/8BD ; ſo that the ſtrength of the ring is to that of the ſolid rod of equal weight as F to 5/4BD, or nearly as FC to BD. This will eaſily appear by recollecting that FO is = (sum of p × r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)/(m × FC) (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotation),</hi> and that the momentum of coheſion is (fm × FC × Fa)/(2FC) = (fm × Fo)/2 for the inner circle, &amp;c.</p><p>Emerſon has given a very inaccurate approximation to this value in his <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> 4to.</p><p>This property of hollow tubes is accompanied alſo with greater ſtiffneſs ; and the ſuperiority in ſtrength and ſtiffness is ſo much the greater as the ſurrounding ſhell is thinner in proportion to its diameter.</p><p>Here we see the admirable wiſdom of the Author of nature in forming the bones of animal limbs hollow. The bones of the arms and legs have to perform the office of levers, and are thus oppoſed to very great tranſverſe ſtrains. By this form they become incomparably ſtronger and ſtiffer, and give more room for the inſertion of muſcles, while they are lighter and therefore more agile ; and the ſame Wisdom has made uſe of this hollow for other valuable purposes of the animal economy. In like manner the quills in the wings of birds acquire by their thinneſs the very great ſtrength which is necessary, while they are ſo light as to give ſufficient buoyancy to the animal in the rare medium in which it mult live and fly about. The ſtalks of many plants, ſuch as all the graſſes, and many reeds, are in like manner hollow, and. thus posseſs an extraordinary ſtrength. Our beſt engineers now begin to imitate nature by making many parts of their machines hollow, ſuch as their axles of cast iron, &amp;c. ; and the ingenious Mr Ramſden now makes the axes and framings of his great aſtronomical inſtruments in the ſame manner.</p><p>In the ſupposition of homogeneous texture, it is plain that the fracture happens as ſoon as the particles at D are ſeparated beyond their utmoſt limit of coheſion. This is a determined quantity, and the piece bends till this degree of extenſion is produced in the outermoſt fibre. It follows, that the ſmaller we ſuppoſe the diſtance between A and D,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0029.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0023"/>
the greater will be the curvature which the beam will acquire before it breaks. Greater depth therefore makes a beam not only ſtronger but alſo ſtiffer. But if the parallel fibres can slide on each other, both the ſtrength and the ſtiffneſs will be diminiſhed. Therefore if, inſtead of one beam D∆KC, we ſuppoſe two, DABC and A∆KB, not cohering, each of them will bend, and the extenſion of the fibres AB of the under beam will not hinder the compreſſion of the adjoining fibres AB of the upper beam. The two together therefore will not be more than twice as ſtrong as one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them (ſuppoſing DA = A∆) inſtead of being four times as ſtrong ; and they will bend as much as either of them alone would bend by half the load. This may be prevented, if it were poſſible to unite the two beams all along the ſeam AB, ſo that the one ſhall not slide on the other. This may be done in ſmall works, by gluing them together with a cement as ſtrong as the natural lateral coheſion of the fibres. If this cannot be done (as it cannot in large works), the sliding is prevented by <hi rend="smallcaps">joggling</hi> the beams together ; that is, by cutting down ſeveral rectangular notches in the upper side of the lower beam, and making ſimilar notches in the under side of the upper beam, and filling up the ſquare ſpaces with pieces of very hard wood firmly driven in, as repreſented in fig. 9. Some employ iron bolts by way of joggles. But when the joggle is much harder than the wood into which it is driven, it is very apt to work loose, by widening the hole into which it is lodged. The ſame thing is ſometimes done by ſcarfing the one upon the other, as repreſented in fig. 9. (n⁰ 2.); but this waſtes more timber, and is not ſo ſtrong, becauſe the mutual hooks which this method forms on each beam are very apt to tear each other up. By one or other of theſe methods, or ſomething ſimilar, may a compound beam be formed, of any depth, which will be almoſt as ſtiff and ſtrong as an entire piece.</p><p>On the other hand, we may combine ſtrength with pliableneſs, by compoſing our beam of ſeveral thin planks laid on each other, till they make a proper depth, and leaving them at full liberty to slide on each other. It is in this manner that coach-springs are formed, as is repreſented in fig. 10. In this assemblage there muſt be no joggles nor bolts of any kind put through the planks or plates ; for this would hinder their mutual sliding. They muſt be kept together by ſtraps which ſurround them, or by ſomething equivalent.</p><p>The preceding obſervations ſhow the propriety of ſome maxims of conſtruction, which the artiſts have derived from long experience.</p><p>Thus, if a mortiſe is to be cut out of a piece which is expoſed to a croſs ſtrain, it ſhould be cut out from that side which becomes concave by the ſtrain, as in fig. 11. but by no means as in fig. 12.</p><p>If a piece is to be ſtrengthened by the addition of another, the added piece muſt be joined to the side which grows convex by the ſtrain, as in fig. 13. and 14.</p><p>Before we go any farther, it will be convenient to recal the reader’s attention to the analogy between the ſtrain on a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and a beam ſupported at both ends and loaded in ſome intermediate point. It is ſufficient on this occasion to read attentively what is delivered in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof,</hi> n⁰ 19. We learn there that the ſtrain on the middle point C (fig. 14. of the preſent article) of a rectangular beam AB, supported on props at A and B, is the ſame as if the part CA projected from a wall, and were loaded with the half of the weight W ſuſpended at A. The momentum of the ſtrain pl is therefore 1/2W × 1/2AB, = W × 1/4AB = p1/4l, or pl/4.</p><p>The momentum of coheſion muſt be equal to this in every hypotheſis.</p><p>Having now conſidered in ſufficient detail the circumſtances which affect the ſtrength of any ſection of a ſolid body that is strained tranſverſely, it is neceſſary to take notice of ſome of the chief modifications of the ſtrain itſelf. We ſhall conſider only thoſe that occur moſt frequently in our conſtructions.</p><p>The ſtrain depends on the external force, and alſo on the lever by which it acts.</p><p>It is evidently of importance, that ſince the ſtrain is exerted in any ſection by means of the coheſion of the parts intervening between the ſection under conſideration and the point of application of the external force, the body muſt be able in all theſe intervening parts to propagate or excite the ſtrain in the remote ſection. In every part it muſt be able to reſiſt the ſtrain excited in that part. It ſhould therefore be equally ſtrong; and it is uſeleſs to have any part ſtronger, becauſe the piece will nevertheleſs break where it is not ſtronger throughout ; and it is uſeleſs to make it ſtronger (relatively to its ſtrain) in any part, for it will nevertheleſs equally fail in the part that is too weak.</p><p>Suppoſe then, in the firſt place, that the ſtrain ariſes from a weight ſuſpended at one extremity, while the other end is firmly fixed in a wall. Supposing alſo the croſs ſections to be all rectangular, there are ſeveral ways of ſhaping the beam ſo that it ſhall be equally ſtrong throughout. Thus it may be equally deep in every part, the upper and under ſurfaces being horizontal planes. The condition will be fulfilled by making all the horizontal ſections triangles, as in fig. 15. The two sides are vertical planes meeting in an edge at the extremity L. For the equation expreſſing the balance of ſtrain and ſtrength is pl = fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Therefore since <hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> is the ſame throughout, and also p, we muſt have fb <hi rend="italic">= l,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (the breadth AD of any ſection ABCD) muſt be proportional to l (or AL), which it evidently is.</p><p>Or, if the beam be of uniform breadth, we muſt have <hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> everywhere proportional to l. This will be obtained by making the depths the ordinates of a common parabola, of which L is the vertex and the length is the axis. The upper or under side may be a ſtraight line, as in fig. 16. or the middle line may be ſtraight, and then both upper and under ſurfaces will be curved. It is almoſt indifferent what is the ſhape of the upper and under ſurfaces, provided the diſtances between them in every part be as the ordinates of a common parabola.</p><p>Or, if the ſections are all ſimilar, ſuch as circles, squares, or any other ſimilar polygons, we muſt have <hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> Or <hi rend="italic">b</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> proportional to l, and the depths or breadths muſt be as the ordinates of a cubical parabola.</p><p>It is evident that theſe are alſo the proper forms for a lever moveable round a fulcrum, and acted on by a force at the extremity. The force comes in the place of the weight ſuſpended in the cases already conſidered ; and as ſuch levers always are connected with another arm, we readily see that both arms ſhould be faſhioned in the ſame manner. Thus in fig. 15. the piece of timber may be supposed a kind of steelyard, moveable round a horizontal axis. OP, in the front of the wall, and having the two weights P and π in equilibrio. The ſtrain occaſioned by each at the ſection in which the axis OP is placed muſt be the ſame, and each arm OL and Ολ muſt be equally ſtrong in all its parts. The longitudinal ſections of each arm muſt be a triangle, a common parabola, or a cubic parabola, according to the conditions previouſly given.</p><p>And, moreover, all theſe forms are equally ſtrong : For any one of them is equally ſtrong in all its parts, and they are all ſuppoſed to have the ſame ſection at the front of the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0030.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0024"/>
wall or at the fulcrum. They are not, however, equally ſtiff. The firſt, repreſented in fig. 15. will bend leaſt upon the whole, and the one formed by the cubic parabola will bend moſt. But their curvature at the very fulcrum will be the ſame in all.</p><p>It is also plain, that if the lever is of the ſecond or third kind, that is, having the fulcrum at one extremity, it muſt ſtill be of the ſame ſhape ; for in abſtract mechanics it is indifferent which of the three points is conſidered as the axis of motion. In every lever the two forces at the extremities act in one direction, and the force in the middle acts in the oppoſite direction, and the great ſtrain is always at that point. Therefore a lever ſuch as fig. 15. moveable round an axis paſſing horizontally through λ, and acting againſt an obſtacle at OP, is equally able in all its parts to refill the strains excited in thoſe parts.</p><p>The ſame principles and the ſame conſtruction will apply to beams, ſuch as joiſts, ſupported at the ends L and λ (fig. 15.), and loaded at ſome intermediate part OP. This will appear evident by merely inverting the directions of the forces at theſe three points, or by recurring to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs,</hi> n⁰ 19.</p><p>Hitherto we have ſuppoſed the external ſtraining force as acting only in one point of the beam. But it may be uniformly diſtributed all over the beam. To make a beam in ſuch circumſtances equally ſtrong in all its parts, the ſhape muſt be conſiderably different from the former.</p><p>Thus ſuppoſe the beam to project from a wall.</p><p>If it be of equal breadth throughout, its sides being vertical planes parallel to each other and to the length, the vertical ſection in the direction of its length muſt be a triangle inſtead of a common parabola ; for the weight uniformly diſtributed over the part lying beyond any ſection, is as the length beyond that ſection : and ſince it may all be conceived as collected at its centre of gravity, which is the middle of that length, the lever by which this load acts or ſtrains the ſection is alſo proportional to the ſame length. The ſtrain on the ſection (or momentum of the load) is as the ſquare of that length. The ſection muſt have ſtrength in the ſame proportion. Its ſtrength being as the breadth and the ſquare of the depth, and the breadth being conſtant, the ſquare of the depth of any ſection muſt be as the ſquare of its diſtance from the end, and the depth muſt be as that diſtance ; and therefore the longitudinal vertical ſection muſt be a triangle.</p><p>But if all the tranſverſe ſections are circles, ſquares, or any other ſimilar figures, the ſtrength of every ſection, or the cube of the diameter, muſt be as the ſquare of the lengths beyond that ſection, or the ſquare of its diſtance from the end ; and the sides of the beam muſt be a semicubical parabola.</p><p>If the upper and under ſurfaces are horizontal planes, it is evident that the breadth muſt be as the ſquare of the diſtance from the end, and the horizontal sections may be formed by arches of the common parabola, having the length for their tangent at the vertex.</p><p>By recurring to the analogy ſo often quoted between a projecting beam and a joiſt, we may determine the proper form of joiſts which are uniformly loaded through their whole length.</p><p>This is a frequent and important case, being the office of joiſts, rafters, &amp;c. and there are ſome circumſtances which muſt be particularly noticed, becauſe they are not so obvious, and have been miſunderſtood. When a beam AB (fig. 17.) is ſupported at the ends, and a weight is laid on any point P, a ſtrain is excited in every part of the beam. The load on P causes the beam to press on A and B, and the props react with forces equal and oppoſite to theſe preſſures. The load at P is to the preſſures at A and B as AB to PB and PA, and the preſſures at A is to that at B as PB to PA ; the beam therefore is in the ſame ſtate, with reſpect to ſtrain in every part of it, as if it were reſting on a prop at P, and were loaded at the ends with weights equal to the two preſsures on the props : and obſerve, theſe preſſures are ſuch as will balance each other, being inversely as their diſtances from P. Let P repreſent the weight or load at P. The preſſure on the prop P muſt PA</p><p>be P × PA/AB. This is therefore the reaction of the prop B, and is the weight which we may ſuppoſe ſuſpended at B, when we conceive the beam reſting on a prop at P, and carrying the balancing weights at A and B.</p><p>The ſtrain occaſioned at any other point C, by the lead P at P, is the ſame with the ſtrain at C, by the weight PA</p><p>P × PA/AB hanging at B, when the beam reſts on P, in the manner now ſuppoſed ; and it is the ſame if the beam, inſtead of being balanced on a prop at P, had its part AP fixed in a wall. This is evident. Now we have ſhown at PA</p><p>length that the ſtrain at C, by the weight P × PA/AB hanging at B, is P × PA/AB × BC. We deſire it to be particularly remarked that the preſſure at A has no influence on the ſtrain at C, ariſing from the action of any load between A and C ; for it is indifferent how the part AP of the projecting beam PB is ſupported. The weight at A juſt performs the ſame office with the wall in which we ſuppoſe the beam to be fixed. We are thus particular, becauſe we have ſeen even perſons not unaccuſtomed to diſcussions of this kind puzzled in their conceptions of this ſtrain.</p><p>Now let the load P be laid on ſome point p between C and B. The ſame reaſoning ſhows us that the point is (with reſpect to ſtrain) in the same ſtate as if the beam were fixed in a wall, embracing tire part pB, and a weight = P × pB/AB were hung on at A, and the ſtrain at C is P × pB/AB × AC.</p><p>In general, therefore, the ſtrain on any point C, ariſing from a load P laid on another point P, is proportional to the rectangle of the diſtances of P and C from the ends neareſt to each. It is P × (PA × CB)/AB, or P ×(pB × CA)/AB,</p><p>according as the load lies between C and A or between C and B.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 1. The ſtrains which a load on any point P occaſions on the points C, c, lying on the ſame side of P, are as the diſtances of theſe points from the end B. In like manner the ſtrains on E and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are as EA and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> A.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 2. The ſtrain which a load occaſions in the part on which it reſts is as the rectangle of the parts on each side.

It is therefore greateſt in the middle.</p><p>Let us now conſider the ſtrain on any point C ariſing from a load uniformly diſtributed along the beam. Let AP be repreſented by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and Pp by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and the whole weight on the beam by <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Then</p><p>The weight on P <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is = a(x/AB),</p><p>Preſſure on B by the weight on Pp = a(x/AB) × a/AB.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0031.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0025"/>

It is there ſaid, that the pressure at B from a weight uniformly diffuſed along AB is the ſame as if it were collected at its centre of gravity, which would be the middle of AB ; and then the ſtrain at C is ſaid to be this preſſure at B multiplied by BC. But ſurely it is not difficult to ſee the difference of theſe ſtrains. It is plain that the pressure of gravity downwards on any point between the end A and the point C has no tendency to diminiſh the ſtrain at C, arising from the upward reaction of the prop B ; whereas the pressure of gravity between C and B is almoſt in direct opposition to it, and muſt diminiſh it. We may however avoid the fluxionary calculus with ſafety by the conſideration of the centre of gravity, by ſuppoſing the weights of AC and BC to be collected at their reſpective centres of gravity ; and the reſult of this computation will be the ſame as above : and we may uſe either method, although the weight is not uniformly diſtributed, provided only that we know in what manner it is diſtributed.</p><p>This inveſtigation is evidently of importance in the practice of the engineer and architect, informing them what ſupport is necessary in the different parts of their conſtructions. We conſidered ſome caſes of this kind in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs.</hi></p><p>It is now eaſy to form a joiſt, ſo that it ſhall have the ſame relative ſtrength in all its parts.</p><p>I. To make it equally able in all its parts to carry a given weight laid on any point C taken at random, or uniformly diffuſed over the whole length, the ſtrength of the ſection at the point C muſt be as AC × CB. Therefore</p><p>1. If the ſides are parallel vertical planes, the ſquare of the depth (which is the only variable dimension) or CD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, muſt be as AC × CB, and the depths muſt be ordinates of an ellipſe.</p><p>2. If the tranſverſe ſections are ſimilar, we muſt make CD <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> as AC × CB.</p><p>3. If the upper and under ſurfaces are parallel, the breadth muſt be as AC × CB.</p><p>II. If the beam is neceſſarily loaded at ſome given point C, and we would have the beam equally able in all its parts to refill the ſtrain arising from the weight at C, we muſt make the ſtrength of every tranſverſe ſection between C and either end as its diſtance from that end. Therefore</p><p>1. If the ſides are parallel vertical planes, we muſt make CD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: EF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = AC : AE.</p><p>2. If the ſections are ſimilar, then CD <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>: EF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = AC : AE.</p><p>3. If the upper and under surfaces are parallel, then, breadth at C ; breadth at E = AC : AE.</p><p>The ſame principles enable us to determine the ſtrain and ſtrength of ſquare or circular plates, of different extent, but equal thickness. This may be comprehended in this general propoſition.</p><p>Similar plates of equal thickneſs ſupported all round will carry the ſame abſolute weight, uniformly diſtributed, or reſting on ſimilar points, whatever is their extent.</p><p>Suppoſe two ſimilar oblong plates of equal thickneſs, and let their lengths and breadths be L, l, and B, <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Let their ſtrength or momentum of coheſion be C, <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and the strains from the weights W, w, be S, s <hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi></p><p>Suppoſe the plates ſupported at the ends only, and reſiſting fracture tranſverſely. The ſtrains, being as the weights and lengths, are as WL and w <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> but their coheſion are as the breadths ; and ſince they are of equal relative ſtrength, we have WL : wl = B : <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and WLb = <hi rend="italic">wl</hi> B and L : <hi rend="italic">l = w</hi> B : W <hi rend="italic">b</hi>: but ſince they are of ſimilar ſhapes L : l = B : <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and therefore w = W.</p><p>The ſame reaſoning holds again when they are alſo ſupported along the ſides, and therefore holds when they are ſupported all round (in which caſe the ſtrength is doubled).</p><p>And if the plates are of any other figure, ſuch as circles or ellipſes, we need only conceive ſimilar rectangles inſcribed in them. Theſe are ſupported all round by the continuity of the plates, and therefore will ſuſtain equal weights ; and the ſame may be ſaid of the ſegments which lie without them, becauſe the ſtrengths of any ſimilar ſegments are equal, their lengths being as their breadths.</p><p>Therefore the thickneſs of the bottoms of vessels holding heavy liquors or grains ſhould be as their diameters, and as the ſquare root of their depths jointly.</p><p>Alſo the weight which a ſquare plate will bear is to that which a bar of the ſame matter and thickneſs will bear as twice the length of the bar to its breadth.</p><p>There is yet another modification of the ſtrain which tends to break a body tranſverſely, which is of very frequent occurrence, and in some caſes muſt be very carefully attended to, viz. the ſtrain arising from its own weight.</p><p>When a beam projects from a wall, every ſection is ſtrained by the weight of all that projects beyond it. This may be conſidered as all collected at its centre of gravity. Therefore the ſtrain on any ſection is in the joint ratio of the weight of what projects beyond it, and the diſtance of its centre of gravity from the ſection.</p><p>The determination of this ſtrain and of the ſtrength necessary for withſtanding it muſt be more complicated than the former, becauſe the form of the piece which reſults from this adjuſtment of ſtrain and ſtrength influences the ſtrain. The general principle muſt evidently be, that the ſtrength or momentum of coheſion of every ſection muſt be as the product of the weight beyond it multiplied by the diſtance of its centre of gravity. For example :</p><p>Suppoſe the beam DLA (fig. 18.) to project from the wall, and that its ſides are parallel vertical planes, ſo that the depth is the only variable dimenſion. Let LB = x and B <hi rend="italic">b = y.</hi> The element B <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> C is <hi rend="italic">— yx.</hi> Let G be the centre of gravity of the part lying without B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and g be its diſtance from the extremity L. Then <hi rend="italic">x—g</hi> is the arm of the lever by which the ſtrain is excited in the ſection B <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Let B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y</hi> be as ſome power m of LB ; that is, let y = x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>. Then the contents of LB <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is (x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> + I)/(m + I). The momentum of gravity round a horizontal axis at L <hi rend="italic">is yxx = x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> m + 1</hi> <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and the whole momentum round the axis is (<hi rend="italic">x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> <hi rend="italic">+ 2)/(m + 2)</hi>. The diſtance of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0032.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0026"/>
the centre of gravity from L is had by dividing this momentum by the whole weight, which is (x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> + 2)/(m + 1).</p><p>The quotient or <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is (x × (m + 1))/(m + 2). And the diſtance of the centre of gravity from the ſection B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is x - (x × m + 1)/(m + 2), = ((x + (m + 2) - x × (m + 1))/(m + 2), = x/(m + 2). Therefore the ſtrain on the ſection B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is had by multiplying (x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> + 1)/(m + 1) by x/(m + 2). The product is (x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> + 2)/((m + 2) × (m + 1)). This muſt be as the ſquare of the depth, or as y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. But y is as x <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>, and y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> as <hi rend="italic">x</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2m</hi> <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Therefore we have m + 2 = 2m <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and m = 2 ; that is, the depth muſt be as the ſquare of the diſtance from the extremity, and the curve L <hi rend="italic">b</hi> A is a parabola touching the horizontal line in L.</p><p>It is eaſy to ſee that a conoid formed by the rotation of this figure round DL will alſo be equally able in every ſection to bear its own weight.</p><p>We need not proſecute this farther. When the figure of the piece is given, there is no difficulty in finding the ſtrain ; and the circumſtance of equal ſtrength to resiſt this ſtrain is chiefly a matter of curiosity.</p><p>It is evident, from what has been already ſaid, that a projecting beam becomes leſs able to bear its own weight, as it projects farther. Whatever may be the ſtrength of the ſection DA, the length may be ſuch that it will break by its own weight. If we ſuppoſe two beams A and B of the ſame ſubſtance and ſimilar ſhapes, that is, having their lengths and diameters in the ſame proportion; and farther ſuppoſe that the ſhorter can just bear its own weight ; then the longer beam will not be able to do the ſame : For the ſtrengths of the ſections are as the cubes of the diameters, while the ſtrains are as the biquadrates of the diameters ; becauſe the weights are as the cubes, and the levers by which theſe weights act in producing the ſtrain are as the lengths or as the diameters.</p><p>Theſe conſiderations show us, that in all caſes where the ſtrain is affected by the weight of the parts of the machine or ſtructure of any kind, the ſmaller bodies are more able to withſtand it than the greater ; and there ſeems to be bounds ſet by nature to the ſize of machines conſtructed of any given materials. Even when the weight of the parts of the machine is not taken into the account, we cannot enlarge them in the ſame proportion in all their parts. Thus a steam-engine cannot be doubled in all its parts, ſo as to be ſtill efficient. The pressure on the piſton is quadrupled. If the lift of the pump be alſo doubled in height while it is doubled in diameter, the load will be increaſed eight times, and will therefore exceed the power. The depth of lift, therefore, muſt remain unchanged; and in this caſe the machine will be of the ſame relative ſtrength as before, independent of its own weight. For the beam being doubled in all its dimenſions, its momentum of coheſion is eight times greater, which is again a balance for a quadruple load acting by a double lever.—But if we now conider the increaſe of the weight of the machine itſelf, which muſt be ſupported, and which muſt be put in motion by the intervention of its coheſion, we ſee that the large machine is weaker and leſs efficient than the ſmall one.</p><p>There is a ſimilar limit ſet by nature to the size of plants and animals formed of the ſame matter. The coheſion of an herb could not ſupport it if it were increaſed to the ſize of a tree, nor could an oak ſupport itſelf if 40 or 50 times bigger, nor could an animal of the make of a long-legged ſpider be increaſed to the ſize of a man ; the articulations of its legs could not ſupport it.</p><p>Hence may be underſtood the prodigious ſuperiority of the ſmall animals both in ſtrength and agility. A man by falling twice his own height may break his firmeſt bones. A mouſe may fall 20 times its height without risk ; and even the tender mite or wood-louſe may fall unhurt from the top of a ſteeple. But their greateſt ſuperiority is in reſpect of nimbleneſs and agility. A flea can leap above 500 times its own length, while the ſtrength of the human muſcles could not raiſe the trunk from the ground on limbs of the ſame conſtruction.</p><p>The angular motions of ſmall animals (in which conſiſts their nimbſeneſs or agility) muſt be greater than thoſe of large animals, ſuppoſing the force of the mucſular fibre to be the ſame in both. For ſuppoſing them ſimilar, the number of equal fibres will be as the ſquare of their linear dimenſions ; and the levers by which they act are as their linear dimenſions. The energy therefore of the moving force is as the cube of theſe dimenſions. But the momentum of inertia, or Sp. r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> is as the 4th power : Therefore the angular velocity of the greater animals is ſmaller. The number of ſtrokes which a fly makes with its wings in a ſecond is aſtonishingly great ; yet, being voluntary, they are the effects of its agility.</p><p>We have hitherto confined our attention to the ſimpleſt form in which this tranſverſe ſtrain can be produced. This was quite ſufficient for showing us the mechaniſm of nature by which the ſtrain is resiſted ; and a very slight attention is ſufficient for enabling us to reduce to this every other way in which the ſtrain can be produced. We ſhall not take up the reader’s time with the application of the ſame principles to other caſes of this ſtrain, but refer him to what has been ſaid in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs.</hi> In that article we have shown the analogy between the ſtrain on the ſection of a beam projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and the ſtrain on the ſame ſection of a beam ſimply reſting on ſupports at the ends, and loaded at ſome intermediate point or points. The ſtrain on the middle C of a beam AB (fig. 19.) ſo ſupported, arising from a weight laid on there, is the ſame with the ſtrain which half that weight hanging at B would produce on the ſame ſection C if the other end of the beam were fixed in a wall. If therefore 1000 pounds hung on the end of a beam projecting 10 feet from a wall will just break it at the wall, it will require 4000 pounds on its middle to break the ſame beam reſting on two props 10 feet aſunder. We have alſo ſhown in that article the additional ſtrength which will be given to this beam by extending both ends beyond the props, and there framing it firmly into other pillars or ſupports. We can hardly add any thing to what has been ſaid in that article, except a few obſervations on the effects of the obliquity of the external force. We have hitherto ſuppoſed it to act in the direction BP (fig. 6.) perpendicular to the length of the beam. Suppoſe it to act in the direction BP, oblique to BA. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof</hi> we ſuppoſed the ſtrain to be the ſame as if the force <hi rend="italic">p</hi> acted at the diſtance AB', but ſtill perpendidicular to AB : ſo it is. But the ſtrength of the ſection <hi rend="smallcaps">A</hi> ∆ is not the ſame in both caſes ; for by the obliquity of the action the piece <hi rend="smallcaps">DCKδ</hi> is pressed to the other. We are not ſufficiently acquainted with the corpuſcular forces to ſay preciſely what will be the effect of the pressure arising from this obliquity ; but we can clearly see, in general, that the point A, which in the inſtant of fracture is neither ſtretched nor compressed muſt now be farther up, or nearer<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0033.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0027"/>
to D ; and therefore the number of particles which are exerting coheſive forces is ſmaller, and therefore the ſtrength is diminiſhed. Therefore, when we endeavour to proportion the ſtrength of a beam to the ſtrain ariſing from an external force acting obliquely, we make too liberal allowance by increaſing this external force in the ratio of AB to AB. We acknowledge our inability to aſſign the proper correction. But this circumſtance is of very great influence. In many machines, and many framings of carpentry, this oblique action of the ſtraining force is unavoidable ; and the moſt enormous ſtrains to which materials are expoſed are generally of this kind. In the frames ſet up for carrying the ring- stones of arches, it is hardly poſſible to avoid them : for although the judicious engineer diſpoſes his beams ſo as to ſuſtain only preſſures in the direction of their lengths, tending either to cruſh them or to tear them aſunder, it frequently happens that, by the settling of the work, the pieces come to check and bear on each other tranſverſely, tending to break each other acroſs. This we have remarked upon in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs,</hi> with reſpect to a truſs by Mr Price (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs,</hi> n⁰ 40, 41, 45). Now when a croſs ſtrain is thus combined with an enormous preſſure in the direction of the length of the bream, it is in the utmoſt danger of ſnapping ſuddenly acroſs. This is one great cauſe of the carrying away of masts. They are compreſſed in the direction of their length by the united force of the ſhrouds, and in this ſtate the tranſverſe action of the wind ſoon completes the fracture.</p><p>When conſidering the compreſſing ſtrains to which materials are expoſed, we deferred the diſcuſſion of the ſtrain on columns, obſerving that it was not, in the cases which uſually occur, a simple compreſſion, but was combined with a tranſverſe ſtrain, ariſing from the bending of the column. When the column ACB (fig. 20.) reſting on the ground at B, and loaded at top with a weight A, acting in the vertical direction AB, is bent into a curve ACB, ſo that the tangent at C is perpendicular to the horizon, its condition ſomewhat reſembles that of a beam firmly fixed between B and C, and strongly pulled by the end A, ſo as to bend it between C and A. Although we cannot conceive how a force acting on a straight column AB in the direction AB can bend it, we may ſuppoſe that the force acted firſt in the horizontal direction A <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> till it was bent to this degree, and that the rope was then gradually removed from the direction A <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to the direction AB, increaſing the force as much as is neceſſary for preſerving the ſame quantity of flexure.</p><p>The firſt author (we belieye) who conſidered this important ſubject with ſcrupulous attention was the celebrated Euler, who publiſhed in the Berlin Memoirs for 1757 his Theory of the Strength of Columns. The general propoſition establiſhed by this theory is, that the ſtrength of priſmatical columns is in the direct quadruplicate ratio of their diameters and the inverſe duplicate ratio of their lengths. He proſecuted this ſubject in the Peterſburgh Commentaries for 1778, confirming his former theory. We do not find that any other author has beſtowed much attention on it, all ſeeming to acquieſce in the determinations of Euler, and to conſider the ſubject as of very great difficulty, requiring the application of the moſt refined mathematics. Muſchenbroek has compared the theory with experiment ; but the compariſon has been very unſatisfactory, the difference from the theory being ſo enormous as to afford no argument for its juſtneſs. But the experiments do not contradict it, for they are so anomalous as to afford no conclusion or general rule whatever.</p><p>To ſay the truth, the theory can be conſidered in no other light than as a ſpecimen of ingenious and very artful algebraic analyſis. Euler was unqueſtionably the firſt analyſt</p><p>in Europe for reſource and addreſs. He knew this, and enjoyed his ſuperiority, and without ſcruple admitted any phyſical assumptions which gave him an opportunity of diſplaying his skill. The inconsiſtency of his aſſumptions with the known laws of mechaniſm gave him no concern ; and when his algebraic proceſſes led him to any concluſion which would make his readers ſtare, being contrary to all our uſual notions, he frankly owned the paradox, but went on in his analyſis, saying, “ <hi rend="italic">Sed analysi magis fidendum. "</hi> Mr Robins has given ſome very risible inſtances of this confidence in his analyſis, or rather of his confidence in the indolent ſubmiſſion of his readers. Nay, ſo fond was he of this kind of amuſement, that after having publiſhed an untenable Theory of Light and Colours, he publiſhed ſeveral Memoirs, explaining the aberration of the heavenly bodies, and deducing ſome very wonderful conſequences, fully confirmed by experience, from the Newtonian principles, which were oppoſite and totally inconſiſtent with his own theory, merely becauſe the Newtonian theory gave him “ <hi rend="italic">occasionem analyſeos promovendae."</hi> We are thus ſevere in our obſervations, becauſe his theory of the ſtrength of columns is one of the ſtrongeſt inſtances of this wanton kind of proceeding, and becauſe his followers in the Academy of St Peterſburgh, ſuch as Mr Fuſs, Lexill, and others, adopt his conclusions, and merely echo his words. Since the death of Dan. Bernoulli no member of that academy has controverted any thing advanced by their <hi rend="italic">Professor ſublimis geometriae,</hi> to whom they had been indebted for their places and for all their knowledge, having been (moſt of them) his amanuenſes, employed by this wonderful man during his blindneſs to make his computations and carry on his algebraic inveſtigations. We are not a little ſurpriſed to ſee Mr Emerſon, a conſiderable mathematician, and a man of very independent ſpirit, haſtily adopting the ſame theory, of which we doubt not but our readers will eaſily ſee the falſity.</p><p>Euler conſiders the column ACB as in a condition preciſely ſimilar to that of an elaſtic rod bent into the curve by a cord AB connecting its extremities.—In this he is not miſtaken.—But he then draws CD perpendicular to AB, and conſiders the ſtrain on the ſection C as equal to the momentum or mechanical energy of the weight A acting in the direction DB upon the lever xcD, moveable round the fulcrum c, and tending to tear aſunder the particle which cohere along the ſection cCx. This is the ſame principle (as Euler admits) employed by James Bernoulli in his inveſtigation of the elaſtic curve ACB. Euler conſiders the ſtrain on the ſection <hi rend="italic">c</hi> x as the ſame with what it would ſuſtain if the ſame power acted in the horizontal direction EF on a point E as far removed from C as the point D is. We reaſoned in the ſame manner (as has been obſerved) in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roofs,</hi> where the obliquity of action was inconſiderable. But in the preſent caſe, this ſubſtitution leads to the greateſt miſtakes, and has rendered the whole of this theory falſe and uſeleſs. It would be juſt if the column were of materials which are incompressible. But it is evident, by what has been ſaid above, that by the compreſſion of the parts the real fulcrum of the lever ſhifts away from the point c, ſo much the more as the compreſſion is greater. In the great compreſſions of loaded columns, and the almoſt unmeaſurable compreſſions of the truſs beams in the centres of bridges, and other cases of chief importance, the fulcrum is ſhifted far over towards x, ſo that very few fibres reſiſt the fracture by their coheſion ; and theſe few have a very feeble energy or momentum, on account of the ſhort arm of the lever by which they act. This is a moſt important conſideration in carpentry, yet makes no element of Euler’s theory. The conſequence of this is, that a very ſmall degree of curvature is ſufficient to cauſe the co-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0034.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0028"/>
lumn or ſtrutt to ſnap in an inſtant, as is well known to every experienced carpenter. The experiment by Muschenbroek, which Euler makes uſe of in order to obtain a meaſure of ſtrength in a particular inſtance, from which he might deduce all others by his theorem, is an inconteſtable proof of this. The force which broke the column is not the twentieth part of what is neceſſary for breaking it by acting at E in the direction EF. Euler takes no notice of this immenſe diſcrepancy, becauſe it muſt have cauſed him to abandon the ſpeculation with which he was then amuſing himſelf.</p><p>The limits of this Work do not afford room to enter minutely upon the refutation of this theory ; but we can eaſily ſhow its uſeleſsneſs, by its total inconſiſtency with common obſervation. It reſults legitimately from this theory, that if CD have no magnitude, the weight A can have no momentum, and the column cannot be broken — True, it cannot be broken in this way, ſnapped by a tranſverſe fracture, if it do not bend ; but we know very well that it can be cruſhed or crippled, and we ſee this frequently happen. This circumſtance or event does not enter into Euler’s inveſtigation, and therefore the theory is imperfect at leaſt and uſeleſs. Had this crippling been introduced in the form of a phyſicial affumption, every topic of reasoning employed in the proceſs muſt have been laid aſide, as the intelligent reader will eaſily ſee. But the theory is not only imperfect, but falſe. The ordinary reader will be convinced of this by another legitimate conſequence of it. Fig. <hi rend="italic">20.</hi> n⁰ 2. is the ſame with fig. 106 of <hi rend="italic">Emerson's Mechanics,</hi> where this ſubject is treated on Euler’s principles, and repreſents a crooked piece of matter resting on the ground at F, and loaded at A with a weight acting in the vertical direction AF. It reſults from Euler’s theory that the ſtrains at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> B, D, E, &amp;c. are as <hi rend="italic">b c,</hi> BC, DI, EK, &amp;c. Therefore the ſtrains at G and H are nothing ; and this is asserted by Emerſon and Euler as a ſerious truth ; and the piece may be thinned <hi rend="italic">ad infnitum</hi> in theſe two places, or even cut through, without any diminution of its ſtrength. The abſurdity of this aſſertion strikes at firſt hearing. Euler aſſerts the ſame thing with reſpect to a point of contrary flexure. Farther diſcuſſion is (we apprehend) needleſs.</p><p>This theory muſt therefore be given up. Yet theſe diſſertations of Euler in the Peterſburgh Commentaries deſerve a peruſal, both as very ingenious ſpecimens of analysis, and becauſe they contain maxims of practice which are important. Although they give an erroneous meaſure of the comparative ſtrength of columns, they ſhow the immenſe importance of preventing all bendings, and point out with accuracy where the tendencies to bend are greateſt, and how this may be prevented by very ſmall forces, and what a prodigious accession of force this gives the column. There is a valuable paper in the ſame volume by Fuſs <hi rend="italic">on the Strains on framed Carpentry,</hi> which may alſo be read with advantage.</p><p>It will now be aſked, what ſhall be ſubſtituted in place of this erroneous theory ? what is the true proportion of the ſtrength of columns ? We acknowledge our inability to give a satisfactory anſwer. Such can be obtained only by a previous knowledge of the proportion between the extensions and compressions produced by equal forces, by the knowledge of the abſolute compreſſions producible by a given force, and by a knowledge of the degree of that derangement of parts which is termed crippling. Theſe circumſtances are but imperfectly known to us, and there lies before us a wide field of experimental inquiry. Fortunately the force requiſite for crippling a beam is prodigious, and a very ſmall lateral ſupport is sufficient to prevent that bending which puts the beam in imminent danger. A judicious engineer will always employ tranſverſe bridles, as they are called, to stay the middle of long beams, which are employed as pillars, ſtrutta, or truſs beams, and are expoſed, by their poſition, to enormous preſſures in the direction of their lengths. Such ſtays may be obſerved, diſpoſed with great judgment and economy, in the centres employed by Mr Perronet in the erection of his great ſtone arches. He was obliged to correct this omission made by his ingenious predecessor in the beautiful centres of the bridge of Orleans, which we have no heſitation in affirming to be the fineſt piece of carpentry in the world.</p><p>It only remains on this head to compare theſe theoretical deductions with experiment.</p><p>Experiments on the tranſverſe ſtrength of bodies are eaſily made, and accordingly are very numerous, eſpecially thoſe made on timber, which is the caſe moſt common and moſt intereſting. But in this great number of experiments there are very few from which we can draw much practical information. The experiments have in general been made on ſuch ſmall scantlings, that the unavoidable natural inequalities bear too great a proportion to the ſtrength of the whole piece. Accordingly, when we compare the experiments of different authors, we find them differ enormously, and even the experiments by the ſame author are very anomalous. The completeſt series that we have yet seen is that detailed by Belidor in his <hi rend="italic">Science des Ingenieurs.</hi> They are contained in the following table.

The theory gives the proportion of 2 to 4. But a difference in the manner of fixing may produce this deviation from the theory, which only ſuppoſed them to be held down at places beyond the props, as when a joiſt is held in the walls, and also reſts on two pillars between the walls. ( See what is ſaid on this ſubject in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof,</hi> 19.) ; where note, that there is a miſtake, when it is ſaid that a beam ſupported at both ends and loaded in the middle will carry twice as much as if one end were fixed in the wall and the weight ſuſpended at the other end. The reaſoning employed there ſhows that it will carry four times as much.</p><p>The chief ſource of irregularity in ſuch experiments is the fibrous, or rather plated texture of timber. It conſiſts of annual additions, whoſe coheſion with each other is vaſtly weaker than that of their own fibres. Let fig. 21. repreſent the ſection of a tree, and ABCD, <hi rend="italic">abcd</hi> the ſection of two battens that are to be cut out of it for experiment, and let AD and <hi rend="italic">a d</hi> be the depths, and DC, <hi rend="italic">d c</hi> the breadths. The batten A BCD will be the ſtrongest, for the ſame reaſon that an aſſemblage of planks ſet edgewise will form a ſtronger joiſt than planks laid above each other like the plates of a coach-ſpring. Mr Buffon found by many trials that the ſtrength of ABCD was to that of <hi rend="italic">abcd</hi> (in oak) nearly as 8 to 7. The authors of the different experiments were not careful that their battens had their plates all diſpoſed ſimilarly with reſpect to the ſtrain.· But even with this precaution they would not have afforded sure grounds of computation for large works ; for great beams occupy much, if not the whole, of the ſection of the tree ; and from this it has happened that their ſtrength is leſs than in proportion to that of a ſmall lath or batten. In ſhort, we can truſt no experiments but ſuch as have been made on large beams. Theſe muſt be very rare, for they are moſt expenſive and laborious, and exceed the abilities of moſt of thoſe who are diſpoſed to ſtudy this matter.</p><p>But we are not wholly without ſuch authority. Mr Buffon and Mr Du Hamel, two of the firſt philoſophers and mechanicians of the age, were directed by government to make experiments on this ſubject, and were ſupplied with ample funds and apparatus. The relation of their experiments is to be found in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1740, 1741, 1742, 1768; as alſo in Du Hamel’s valuable performances s <hi rend="italic">ur l'Exploitation des Arbres, et ſur la Conſervation et le Tranſport de Bois.</hi> We earneſtly recommend theſe diſſertations to the peruſal of our readers, as containing much uſeful information relative to the ſtrength of timber, and the beſt methods of employing it. We ſhall here give an abſtract of Mr Buffon’s experiments.</p><p>He relates a great number which he had proſecuted during two years on ſmall battens. He found that the odds of a single layer, or part of a layer, more or leſs, or even a different diſpoſition of them, had ſuch influence that he was obliged to abandon this method, and to have recourſe to the largeſt beams that he was able to break. The following table exhibits one ſeries of experiments on bars of ſound-oak, clear of knots, and four inches ſquare. This is a ſpecimen of all the rest.</p><p>Column 1ſt is the length of the bar in feet clear between the ſupports.</p><p>Column 2d is the weight of the bar (the 2d day after it was felled) in pounds. Two bars were tried of each length. Each of the firſt three pairs conſiſted of two cuts of the ſame tree. The one next the root was always found the heavieſt, ſtiffeſt, and ſtrongeſt. Indeed Mr Buffon ſays that this was invariably true, that the heavieſt was always the ſtrongeſt ; and he recommends it as a certain (or ſure) rule for the choice of timber. He finds that this is always the caſe when the timber has grown vigorouſly, forming very thick annual layers. But he also obſerves that this is only during the advances of the tree to maturity ; for the ſtrength of the different circles approaches gradually to equality during the tree’s healthy growth, and then it decays in theſe parts in a contrary order. Our tool-makers assert the ſame thing with reſpect to beech : yet a contrary opinion is very prevalent ; and wood with a fine, that is, a ſmall grain, is frequently preferred. Perhaps no person has ever made the trial with ſuch minuteneſs as Mr Buffon, and we think that much deference is due to his opinion.</p><p>Column 3d is the number of pounds neceſſary for breaking the tree in the courſe of a few minutes.</p><p>Column 4th is the inches which it bent down before breaking.</p><p>Column 5th is the time at which it broke.</p><table> <row> <cell>1</cell> <cell><hi rend="italic">2</hi></cell> <cell>3</cell> <cell>4</cell> <cell>5</cell> </row> <row> <cell>7</cell> <cell>60</cell> <cell>5350</cell> <cell>3,5</cell> <cell>29'</cell> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>56</cell> <cell>5275</cell> <cell>4,5</cell> <cell>22</cell> </row> <row> <cell>8</cell> <cell>68</cell> <cell>4600</cell> <cell>3,75</cell> <cell>15</cell> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>63</cell> <cell>4500</cell> <cell>4,7</cell> <cell><hi rend="smallcaps">13</hi></cell> </row> <row> <cell>9</cell> <cell>77</cell> <cell>4100</cell> <cell>4,85</cell> <cell>14</cell> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>71</cell> <cell>3950</cell> <cell>5,5</cell> <cell>12</cell> </row> <row> <cell>10</cell> <cell>84</cell> <cell>3625</cell> <cell>5,83</cell> <cell><hi rend="italic">15</hi></cell> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>82</cell> <cell>3600</cell> <cell>6,5</cell> <cell>15</cell> </row> <row> <cell>12</cell> <cell>100</cell> <cell>3050</cell> <cell>7,</cell> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell/> <cell>98</cell> <cell>2925</cell> <cell>8,</cell> <cell/> </row> </table><p>The experiments on other ſizes were made in the same way.

Trying them in this green state gave him an opportunity of obſerving a very curious and unaccountable phenomenon. When the weights were laid briſkly on, nearly ſufficient to break the log, a very senſible ſmoke was obſerved to iſſue from the two ends with a sharp hiſſing noiſe. This continued all the while the tree was bending and cracking. This ſhows that the log is affected or ſtrained through its whole length ; indeed this muſt be inferred from its bending through its whole length. It alſo ſhows us the great effects of the compreſſion. It is a pity Mr Buffon did not take notice whether this ſmoke iſſued from the upper or compreſſed half of the ſection only, or whether it came from the whole.</p><p>We muſt now make ſome obſervations on theſe experiments, in order to compare them with the theory which we have endeavoured to eſtabliſh.</p><p>Mr Buffon conſiders the experiments with the 5-inch bars as the ſtandard of companion, having both extended theſe to greater lengths, and having tried more pieces of each length.</p><p>Our theory determines the relative ſtrength of bars of the same ſection to be inverſely as their lengths. But (if we except the five experiments in the firſt column) we find a very great deviation from this rule. Thus the 5-inch bar of 28 feet long ſhould have half the ſtrength of that of 14 feet, or 2650; whereas it is but 1775. The bar oſ 14 feet ſhould have half the ſtrength of that of 7 feet, or 5762 ; whereas it is but 5300. In like manner, the fourth of 11525 is 2881 ; but the real ſtrength of the 28-feet bar is 1775. We have added a column A, which exhibits the ſtrength which each of the 5-inch bars ought to have by the theory. This deviation is moſt diſtinctly ſeen in fig. 22. where BK is the ſcale of lengths, B being at the point 7 of the ſcale and K at 28. The ordinate CB is = 11525, and the other ordinates DE, GK, &amp;c. are reſpectively = 7CB/Length. The lines DF, GH, &amp;c. are made = 4350, 1775, &amp;c. expressing the ſtrengths given by experiment. The 10-feet bar and the 24-feet bar are remarkably anomalous. But all are deficient, and the defect has an evident progreſſion from the firſt to the laſt. The ſame thing may be ſhown of the other columns, and even of the firſt, though it is very ſmall in that column. It may alſo be obſerved in the experiments of Belidor, and in all that we have ſeen. We cannot doubt therefore of its being a law of nature, depending on the true principles of coheſion and the laws of mechanics.</p><p>But it is very puzzling, and we cannot pretend to give a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty. The only effect which we can conceive the length of a beam to have, is to increaſe the ſtrain at the ſection of fracture by employing the intervening beam as a lever. But we do not diſtinctly ſee what change this can produce in the mode of action of the fibres in this ſection, ſo as either to change their coheſion or the place of its centre of effort; yet ſomething of this kind muſt happen.</p><p>We ſee indeed ſome circumſtances which muſt contribute to make a ſmaller weight ſufficient, in Mr Buffon’s experiments, to break a long beam than in the exact inverſe proportion of its length.</p><p>In the firſt place, the weight of the beam itſelf augments the ſtrain as much as if half of it were added in form of a weight. Mr Buffon has given the weights of every beam on which he made experiments, which is very nearly 74 pounds <hi rend="italic">per</hi> cubic foot. But they are much too ſmall to account for the deviation from the theory. The half weights of the 5-inch beams of 7, 14, and 28 feet length are only 45, 92, and 182 pounds; which makes the real ſtrains in the experiments 11560, 5390, and 1956; which are far from having the proportions oſ 4, 2, and 1.</p><p>Buffon ſays that healthy trees are univerſally ſtrongeſt at the root end ; therefore, when we uſe a longer beam, ita middle point, where it is broken in the experiment, is in a weaker part of the tree. But the trials of the 4-inch beams ſhow that the difference from this cauſe is almost inſenſible.</p><p>The length muſt have ſome mechanical influence which the theory we have adopted has not yet explained. It may not however be inadequate to the taſk. The very ingenious inveſtigation of the elaſtic curve by James Bernoulli and other celebrated mathematicians is perhaps as refined an application of mathematical analysis as we know. Yet in this inveſtigation it was neceſſary, in order to avoid almoſt inſuperable difficulties, to take the ſimpleſt poſſible caſe, viz. where the thickneſs is exceedingly ſmall in compariſon with the length. If the thickneſs be conſiderable, the quantities neglected in the calculus are too great to permit the conclusion to be accurate, or very nearly ſo. Without being able to define the form into which an elaſtic body of conſiderable thickneſs will be bent, we can ſay with confidence, that in an extreme caſe, where the compreſſion in the concave side is very great, the curvature differs conſiderably from the Bernoullian curve. But as our inveſtigation is incomplete and very long, we do not offer it to the reader. The following more familiar conſiderations will, we apprehend, render it highly probable that the relative ſtrength of beams decreaſes faſter than in the inverſe ratio of their length. The curious obſervation by Mr Buffon of the vapour which iſſued with a hiſſing noiſe from the ends of a beam of green oak, while it was breaking by the load on its middle, ſhows that the whole length of the piece was affected : indeed it muſt be, ſince it is bent throughout. We have ſhown above, that a certain definite curvature of a beam of a given form is always accompanied by rupture. Now ſuppoſe the beam A of 10 feet long, and the beam B of 20 feet long, bent to the ſame degree, at the place of their fixure in the wall ; the weight which hangs on A is nearly double of that which muſt hang on B. The form of any portion, ſuppoſe 5 feet, of theſe two beams, immediately adjoining to the wall, is conſiderably different. At the diſtance of 5 feet the curvature of A is 1/2 of its curvature at the wall. The curvature of B in the correſponding point is 3/4ths of the ſame curvature at the wall. Through the whole of the intermediate 5 feet, therefore, the curvature of B is greater than that of A. This muſt make it weaker throughout. It muſt occaſion the fibres to slide more on each other (that it may acquire t <hi rend="italic">his</hi> greater curvature), and thus affect their lateral<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0037.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0031"/>
union ; and therefore thoſe which are ſtronger will not aſſiſt their weaker neighbours. To this we must add, that in the ſhorter beams the force with which the fibres are preſſed laterally on each other is double. This must impede the mutual sliding of the fibres which we mentioned a little ago; nay, this lateral compreſſion may change the law of longitudinal coheſion (as will readily appear to the reader who is acquainted with Boſcovich’s doctrines), and increaſe the strength of the very ſurface of fracture, in the ſame way (however inexplicable) as it does in metals when they are hammered or drawn into wire.</p><p>The reader must judge how far theſe remarks are worthy of his attention. The engineer will carefully keep in mind the important fact, that a beam of quadruple length, instead of having 1/4th of the strength, has only about 1/6th ; and the philoſopher ſhould endeavour to diſcover the cauſe of this diminution, that he may give the artist a more accurate rule of computation.</p><p>Our ignorance of the law by which the coheſion of the particles changes by a change of distance, hinders us from diſcovering the preciſe relation between the curvature and the momentum of coheſion ; and all we can do is to multiply experiments, upon which we may establiſh ſome <hi rend="italic">empirical</hi> rules for calculating the strength of ſolids. Thoſe from which we must reaſon at preſent are few and too anomalous to be the foundation of ſuch an empirical formula. We may, however, obſerve, that Mr Buffon’s experiments give us considerable aſſistance in this particular : For if to each of the numbers of the column for the 5-inch beams, corrected by adding half the weight of the beam, we add the constant number 1245, we ſhall have a ſet of numbers which are very nearly reciprocals of the lengths. Let 1245 be called c <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and let the weight which is known by experiment to be neceſſary for breaking the 5-inch beam of the length <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be called P. We ſhall have ((P + c) <hi rend="italic">× a)/l - c = p.</hi> Thus the weight neceſſary for breaking the 7-foot bar is 11560. This added to 1245, and the ſum multiplied by 7, gives (P + <hi rend="italic">c) × a ≡ 89635.</hi> Let l be 18 ; then 89635/18 - 1245 = 3725, = p, which differs not more than 1/40th from what experiment gives us. This rule holds equally well in all the other lengths except the 10 and 24 foot beams, which are very anomalous. Such a formula is abundantly exact for practice, and will anſwer through a much greater variety of length, though it cannot be admitted as a true one ; becauſe, in a certain very great length, the strength will be nothing. For other ſizes the constant number must change in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi>, or perhaps of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p><p>The next companion which we have to make with the theory is the relation between the strength and the ſquare of the depth of the ſection. This is made by comparing with each other the numbers in any horizontal line of the table. In making this compariſon we find the numbers of the five-inch bars uniformly greater than the rest. We imagine that there is ſomething peculiar to theſe bars : They are in general heavier than in the proportion of their ſection, but not ſo much ſo as to account for all their ſuperiority. We imagine that this ſet of experiments, intended as a standard for the rest, has been made at one time, and that the ſeaſon has had a conſiderable influence. The fact however is, that if this column be kept out; or uniformly diminiſhed about 1/16th in their strength, the different ſizes will deviate very little from the ratio of the ſquare of the depth, as determined by theory. There is however a ſmall deficiency in the bigger beams.</p><p>We have been thus anxious in the examination of theſe experiments, becauſe they are the only ones which have been related in sufficient detail, and made on a proper ſcale for giving us data from which we can deduce confidential maxims for practice. They are ſo troublesome and expenſive that we have little hopes of ſeeing their number greatly increaſed ; yet ſurely our navy board would do an unſpeakable ſervice to the public by appropriating a fund for ſuch experiments under the management of ſome man of ſcience.</p><p>There remains another compariſon which is of chief importance, namely, the proportion between the <hi rend="smallcaps">absolute cohesion</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">relative strength.</hi> It may be guessed, from the very nature of the thing, that this must be very uncertain. Experiments on the abſolute strength must be confined to very ſmall pieces, by reaſon of the very great forces which are required for tearing them aſunder. The values therefore deduced from them must be ſubject to great inequalities. Unfortunately we have got no detail of any experiments ; all that we have to depend on is two paſſages of Muſchenbroek’s <hi rend="italic">Eſſais de Phyſique ;</hi> in one of which he lays that a piece of sound oak 27/100ths of an inch square is torn aſunder by 1150 pounds ; and in the other, that an oak plank 12 inches broad and 1 thick will juſt ſuſpend 189163 pounds. Theſe give for the coheſion of an inch ſquare 15,755 and 15,763 pounds. Bouguer, in his <hi rend="italic">Traité du Navire,</hi> ſays that it is very well known that a rod of sound oak 1/4th of an inch ſquare will be torn aſunder by 1000 pounds. This gives 16000 for the coheſion of a ſquare inch. We ſhall take this as a round number, eaſily uſed in our computations. Let us compare this with Mr Buffon’s trials of beams four inches ſquare.</p><p>The abſolute coheſion of this ſection is 16,000 × 16 = 256,000. Did every fibre exert its whole force in the instant of fracture, the momentum of coheſion would be the ſame as if it had all acted at the centre of gravity of the ſection at 2 inches from the axis of fracture, and is therefore 512000. The 4-inch beam, 7 feet long, was broken by 5312 pounds hung on its middle. The half of this, or 2656 pounds, would have broken it, if ſuſpended at its extremity, projecting 3 1/2 ſect or 42 inches from a wall. The momentum of this strain is therefore 2656 × 42, = 111552. Now this is in equilibrio with the actual momentum of cohesion, which is therefore 111552, instead of 512000. The strength is therefore diminiſhed in the proportion of 512000 to 111552, or very nearly of 4,59 to 1.</p><p>As we are quite uncertain as to the place of the centre of effort, it is needleſs to conſider the full coheſion as acting at the centre of gravity, and producing the momentum 512,000 ; and we may convert the whole into a simple multiplyer <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of the length, and say, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> m <hi rend="italic">times the length is to the depth, ſo is the abſolute coheſion of the ſection to the relative strength.</hi> Therefore let the abſolute coheſion of a ſquare inch be called f <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the breadth <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the depth <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the length <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (all in inches), the relative strength, or the external force <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which balances it, is fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /9,181,or in round numbers fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /9l; for m = 2 <hi rend="italic">× 4,59.</hi></p><p>This great diminution of strength cannot be wholly accounted for by the inequality of the coheſive forces exerted in the inſtant of fracture ; for in this caſe we know that the centre of effort is at 1/3d of the height in a rectangular section (becauſe the forces really exerted are as the extenſions of the fibres). The relative strength would be fbd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /3l, and p would have been 8127 instead of 2656.</p><p>We must aſcribe this diminution (which is three times greater than that produced by the inequality of the cohe-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0038.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0032"/>
sive forces) to the compreſſion of the under part of the beam ; and we muſt endeavour to explain in what manner this compreſſion produces an effect which ſeems ſo little explicable by ſuch means.</p><p>As we have repeatedly obſerved, it is a matter of nearly univerſal experience that the forces <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> exerted by the particles of bodies, when ſtretched or compreſſed, are very nearly in the proportion of the diſtances to which the particles are drawn from their natural poſitions. Now, altho’ we are certain that, in enormous compreſſions, the forces increaſe faſter than in this proportion, this makes no ſenſible change in the preſent queſtion, becauſe the body is broken before the compreſſions have gone ſo far ; nay, we imagine that the compreſſed parts are crippled in moſt caſes even before the extended parts are torn aſunder. Muſchenbroek aſſerts this with great confidence with reſpect to oak, on the authority of his own experiments. He ſays, that although oak will ſuſpend half as much again as fir, it will not ſupport, as a pillar, two-thirds of the load which fir will ſupport in that form.</p><p>We imagine therefore that the mechaniſm in the <hi rend="italic">preſent</hi> case is nearly as follows ;</p><p>Let the beam DCK∆ (fig. 23.) be loaded at its extremity with the weight P, acting in the direction KP perpendicular to DC. Let D∆ be the ſection of fracture. Let DA be about 1/3d of D∆. A will be the particle or fibre which is neither extended nor compreſſed. Make ∆δ; Dd = DA : A <hi rend="smallcaps">δ.</hi> The triangles DA <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> Aδ, will repreſent the accumulated attracting and repelling forces. Make AI and Ai ≡ 1/3DA and 1/3 <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> A. The point I will be that to which the full coheſion D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> or <hi rend="italic">f</hi> of the particles in AD muſt be applied, ſo as to produce the ſame momentum which the variable forces at I, D, &amp;c. really produce at their ſeveral points of application. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is the centre of ſimilar effort of the repulsive forces excited by the compreſſion between A and ∆, and it is the real fulcrum of a bended lever I <hi rend="italic">i</hi> K, by which the whole effect is produced. The effect is the ſame as if the full coheſion of the ſtretched fibres in AD were accumulated in I, and the full repulsion of all the compreſſed fibres in A∆ were accumulated in <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The forces which are balanced in the operation are the weight P, acting by the arm <hi rend="italic">ki,</hi> and the full coheſion of AD acting by the arm I <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The forces exerted by the compreſſed fibres between A and ∆ only ſerve to give ſupport to the lever, that it may exert its ſtrain.</p><p>We imagine that this does not differ much from the real procedure of nature. The position of the point A may be different from what we have deduced from Mr Buffon’s experiments, compared with Muſchenbroek’s value of the absolute cohesion of a ſquare inch. If this laſt ſhould be only 12000, DA muſt be greater than we have here made it, in the proportion of 12000 to 16000. For I <hi rend="italic">i</hi> muſt ſtill be made = 1/3A∆, ſupposing the forces to be proportional to the extensions and compreſſions. There can be no doubt that a part only of the coheſion of D∆ operates in refilling the fracture in all ſubſtances which have any compreſſibility ; and it is confirmed by the experiments of Mr Du Hamel on willow, and the inferences are by no means confined to that ſpecies of timber. We ſay therefore, that when the beam is broken, the coheſion of AD alone is exerted, and that each fibre exerts a force proportional to its extension ; and the accumulated momentum is the ſame as if the full coheſion of AD were acting by the lever I <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ≡ 1/3d of D <hi rend="smallcaps">δ .</hi></p><p>It may be said, that if only 1/3d of the coheſion of oak be exerted, it may be cut 2/3ds through without weakening it. But this cannot be, becauſe the coheſion of the whole is employed <hi rend="italic">in</hi> preventing the lateral slide ſo often mentioned. We have no experiments to determine that it <hi rend="italic">may not</hi> be cut through 1/3d without loss of its ſtrength.</p><p>This muſt not be conſidered as a ſubject of mere ſpeculative curiosity : It is intimately connected with all the practical uſes which we can make of this knowledge ; for it is almoſt the only way that we can learn the compreſſibilſty of timber. Experiments on the direct coheſion are indeed difficult, and exceedingly expensive if we attempt them in large pieces. But experiments on compreſſion are almoſt impracticable. The moſt inſtructive experiments would be, firſt to eſtabliſh, by a great number of trials, the tranſverſe force of a modern batten ; and then to make a great number of trials of the diminution of its ſtrength, by cutting it through on the concave side. This would very nearly give us the proportion of the coheſion which really operates in refitting fractures. Thus if it be found that one-half of the beam may be cut on the under side without diminution of its ſtrength (taking care to drive in a ſlice of harder wood), we may conclude that the point A is at the middle, or ſomewhat above it.</p><p>Much lies before the curious mechanician, and we are as yet very far from a ſcientific knowledge of the ſtrength of timber.</p><p>In the mean time, we may derive from theſe experiments of Buffon a very uſeful practical rule, without relying on any value of the abſolute coheſion of oak. We ſee that the ſtrength is nearly as the breadth, as the ſquare of the depth, and as the inverse of the length. It is moſt convenient to meaſure the breadth and depth of the beam in inches, and its length in feet. Since, then, a beam four inches ſquare and ſeven feet between the ſupports is broken by 5312 pounds, we muſt conclude that a batten one inch ſquare and one foot between the ſupports will be broken by 581 pounds. Then the ſtrength of any other beam of oak, or the weight which will juſt break it when hung on its middle, <hi rend="italic">bd</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi></p><p>is 581(bd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /l).</p><p>But we have ſeen that there is a very considerable deviation from the inverſe proportion of the lengths, and we muſt endeavour to accommodate our rule to this deviation. We found, that by adding 1245 to each of the ordinates or numbers in the column of the five-inch bars, we had a ſet of numbers very nearly reciprocal of the lengths ; and if we make a ſimilar addition to the other columns in the proportion of the cubes of the fixes, we have nearly the ſame reſult. The greateſt error (except in the caſe of experiments which are very irregular) does not exceed 1/15th of the whole. Therefore, for a radical number, add to the 5312 the number 640, which is to 1245 very nearly as 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to 5 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. This gives 5952. The 64th of this is 93, which correſponds to a bar of one inch ſquare and ſeven feet long. Therefore 93 × 7 will be the reciprocal corresponding to a bar of one foot. This is 651. Take from this the preſent empirical correction, which is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 40/b4, or 10, and there remains 641 for the ſtrength of the bar. This gives us for a general rule p = 651(bd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)/l - 10bd <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Example.</hi> Required the weight neceſſary to break an oak beam eight inches ſquare and 20 feet between the props, p <hi rend="italic">=</hi> 651 × (8 <hi rend="italic">×</hi> 8 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)/20 - (10 <hi rend="italic">× 8 × 8</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> <hi rend="italic">).</hi> This is 11545, whereas the experiment gives 11487. The error is very ſmall indeed. The rule is moſt deficient in compariſon with the five-inch bars, which we have already ſaid appear ſtronger than the reſt.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0039.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0033"/>
The following proceſs is eaſily remembered by such as are not algebraiſts.</p><p>Multiply the breadth in inches twice by the depth, and call this product f <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Multiply by 651, and divide by the length in feet. From the quotient take 10 times f <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The remainder is the number of pounds which will break the beam.</p><p>We are not ſufficiently ſenſible of our principles to be confident that the correction 10 f ſhould be in the proportion of the ſection, although we think it moſt probable. It is quite empirical, founded on Buffon’s experiments. Therefore the ſafe way of using this rule is to ſuppoſe the beam ſquare, by increaſing or diminiſhing its breadth till equal to the depth. Then find the ſtrength by this rule, and diminiſh or increaſe it for the change which has been made in its breadth. Thus, there can be no doubt that the ſtrength of the beam given as an example is double of that of a beam of the same depth and half the breadth.</p><p>The reader cannot but obſerve that all this calculation relates to the very greateſt weight which a beam will bear for a very few minutes. Mr Buffon uniformly found that two-thirds of this weight ſenſibly impaired its ſtrength, and frequently broke it at the end of two or three months. One-half of this weight brought the beam to a certain bend, which did not increaſe after the firſt minute or two, and may be borne by the beam for any length of time. But the beam contracted a bend, of which it did not recover any conſiderable portion. One-third ſeemed to have no permanent effect on the beam ; but it recovered its rectilineal ſhape completely, even after having been loaded ſeveral months, provided that the timber was ſeaſoned when firſt loaded ; that is to ſay, one-third of the weight which would quickly break a ſeaſoned beam, or one-fourth of what would break one just felled, may lie on it for ever without giving the beam a sett.</p><p>We have no detail of experiments on the ſtrength of other kinds of timber : only Mr Buffon says, that fir has about 6/10ths of the ſtrength of oak ; Mr Parent makes it 10/12ths ; Emerſon, 2/3ds, &amp;c.</p><p>We have been thus minute in our examination of the mechanism of this transverſe ſtrain, becauſe it is the greateſt to which the parts of our machines are exposed. We wiſh to impreſs on the minds of artiſts the neceſſity of avoiding this as much as poſſible. They are improving in this reſpect, as may be ſeen by comparing the centres on which ſtone arches of great ſpan are now turned with thoſe of former times. They were formerly a load of mere joiſts reſting on a multitude of poſts, which obſtructed the navigation, and were frequently losing their ſhape by ſome of the poſts sinking into the ground. Now they are more generally trusses, where the beams abutt on each other, and are relieved from tranſverſe strains. But many performances of eminent artiſts are ſtill very injudiciouſly expoſed to croſs ſtrains. We may inſtance one which is considered as a fine work, viz. the bridge at Walton on Thames. Here every beam of the great arch is a joiſt, and it hangs together by framing. The fineſt piece of carpentry that we have ſeen is the centre employed in turning the arches of the bridge at Orleans, deſcribed by Perronet. In the whole there is not one croſs ſtrain. The beam, too, of Hornblower’s ſteam-engine, deſcribed in that article, is very ſcientifically conſtructed.</p><p>IV. The laſt ſpecies of ſtrain which we are to examine is that produced by twilling. This takes place in all axles which connect the working parts of machines.</p><p>Although we cannot pretend to have a very diſtinct conception of that modification of the coheſion of a body by which it reſiſts this kind of ſtrain, we can have no doubt that, when all the particles act alike, the reſiſtance must be proportional to the number. Therefore if we ſuppoſe the two parts ABCD, ABFE (fig. 24.), of the body EFCD to be of inſuperable ſtrength, but cohering more weakly in the common ſurface AB, and that one part ABCD is pushed laterally in the direction AB, there can be no doubt that it will yield only there, and that the reſiſtance will be proportional to the ſurface.</p><p>In like manner, we can conceive a thin cylindrical tube, of which KAH (fig. 25.) is the ſection, as cohering more weakly in that ſection than anywhere else. Suppoſe it to be graſped in both hands, and the two parts twiſted round the axis in oppoſite directions, as we would twiſt the two joints of a flute, it is plain that it will firſt fail in this ſection, which is the circumference of a circle, and the particles of the two parts which are contiguous to this circumference will be drawn from each other laterally. The total reſiſtance will be as the number of equally reſiſting particles, that is, as the circumference (for the tube being ſuppoſed very thin, there can be no ſenſible difference between the dilatation of the external and internal particles). We can now ſuppoſe another tube within this, and a third within the ſecond, and ſo on till we reach the centre. If the particles of each ring exerted the ſame force (by ſuffering the same dilatation in the direction of the circumference), the reſiſtance of each ring of the ſection would be as its circumference and its breadth (ſuppoſed indefinitely ſmall), and the whole reſiſtance would be as the ſurface ; and this would repreſent the reſiſtance of a ſolid cylinder. But when a cylinder is twiſted in this manner by an external force applied to its circumference, the external parts will ſuffer a greater circular extenſion than the internal ; and it appears that this extenſion (like the extenſion of a beam ſtrained tranſverſely) will be proportional to the diſtance of the particles from the axis. We cannot ſay that this is demonſtrable, but we can aſſign no proportion that is more probable. This being the case, the forces simultaneouſly exerted by each particle will be as its diſtance from the axis. Therefore the whole force exerted by each ring will be as the ſquare of its radius, and the accumulated force actually exerted will be as the cube of the radius ; that is, the accumulated force exerted by the whole cylinder, whoſe radius is CA, is to the accumulated force exerted <hi rend="italic">at the ſame time</hi> by the part whoſe radius is CE, as CA <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to CE <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.</p><p>The whole coheſion now exerted is juſt two-thirds of what it would be if all the particles were exerting the ſame attractive forces which are juſt now exerted by the particles in the external circumference. This is plain to any perſon in the leaſt familiar with the fluxionary calculus. But ſuch as are not may eaſily ſee it in this way.</p><p>Let the rectangle AC <hi rend="italic">c a</hi> be ſet upright on the ſurface of the circle along the line CA, and revolve round the axis C <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> It will generate a cylinder whoſe height is Cc or A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and having the circle KAH for its baſe. If the diagonal C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be ſuppoſed also to revolve, it is plain that the triangle <hi rend="italic">c</hi> C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will generate a cone of the ſame height, and having for its baſe the circle deſeribed by the revolution of <hi rend="italic">ca,</hi> and the point C for its apex. The cylindrical ſurface generated by Aa will expreſs the whole coheſion exerted by the circumference AHK, and the cylindrical ſurface generated by E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> will repreſent the coheſion exerted by the circumference ELM, and the ſolid generated by the triangle CA <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will repreſent the coheſion exerted by the whole circle AHK, and the cylinder generated by the rectangle AC <hi rend="italic">ca</hi> will repreſent the coheſion exerted by the ſame ſurface if each particle had ſuffered the extenſion A <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p><p>Now it is plain, in the first place, that the ſolid generated by the triangle <hi rend="italic">e</hi> EC is to that generated by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> AC as EC <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to AC <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. In the next place, the ſolid generated by<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0040.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0034"/>
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> AC is two-thirds of the cylinder, becauſe the cone generated by <hi rend="italic">c</hi> C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is one-third of it.</p><p>We may now ſuppoſe the cylinder twiſted till the particles in the external circumference lose their coheſion. There can be no doubt that it will now be wrenched aſunder, all the inner circles yielding in ſucceſſion. Thus we obtain one uſeful information, viz. that a body of homogeneous texture refills a sim <hi rend="italic">ple twist</hi> with two-thirds of the force with which it resists an attempt to force one part laterally from the other, or with one-third part of the force which will cut it aſunder by a ſquare-edged tool. For to drive a ſquare- edged tool through a piece of lead, for inſtance, is the ſame as forcing a piece of the lead as thick as the tool laterally away from the two pieces on each side of the tool. Experiments of this kind do not ſeem difficult, and they would give us very uſeful information.</p><p>When two cylinders AHK and BNO are wrenched asunder, we muſt conclude that the external particles of each are just put beyond their limits of coheſion, are equally extended, and are exerting equal forces. Hence it follows, that in the inſtant of fracture the ſum total of the forces actually exerted are as the ſquares of the diameters.</p><p>For drawing the diagonal C , it is plain that Er, = Aa, expreſſes the distension of the circumference ELM, and that the ſolid generated by the triangle CE <hi rend="italic">e</hi> expreſſes the coheſion exerted by the ſurface of the circle ELM, when the particles in the circumference ſuffer the extenſion E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> equal to Aa. Now the solids generated by CA <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and CE <hi rend="italic">e</hi> being respectively two thirds of the correſponding cylinders, are as the ſquares of the diameters.</p><p>Having thus aſcertained the real ſtrength of the ſection, and its relation to its abſolute lateral ſtrength, let us examine its ſtrength relative to the external force employed to break it. This examination is very simple in the case under conſideration. The straining force muſt act by ſome lever, and the coheſion muſt oppoſe it by acting on ſome other lever. The centre of the ſection may be the neutral point, whoſe position is not diſturbed.</p><p>Let F be the force exerted laterally by an exterior particle. Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the radius of the cylinder, and <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> the indeterminate diſtance of any circumference, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the indefinitely ſmall interval between the concentric arches ; that is, let <hi rend="italic">X</hi> be the breadth of a ring and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> its radius. The forces being as the extenſions, and the extenſions as the diſtances from the axis, the coheſion actually exerted at any part of any ring will be fxx/a. The force exerted by the whole ring (being as the circumference or as the radius) f(x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x)/a. The momentum of coheſion of a ring, being as the force multiplied by its lever, will be f(x <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> x)/a. The accumulated momentum will be the ſum or fluent of f(x <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> x)/a; that is, when <hi rend="italic">x = a,</hi> it will be 1/4f(a <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> /a), = 1/4fa <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.</p><p>Hence we learn that the ſtrength of an axle, by which it reſiſts being wrenched aſunder by a force acting at a given diſtance from the axis, is as the cube of its diameter.</p><p>But farther, 1/4f <hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> is <hi rend="italic">= fa</hi> <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × 1/4 <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Now fa <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> repreſents the full lateral coheſion of the ſection. The momentum thereſore is the ſame as if the full lateral coheſion were accumulated at a point diſtant from the axis by 1/4th of the radius or ⅛th of the diameter of the cylinder.</p><p>Therefore let F be the number of pounds which meaſures the lateral coheſion of a circular inch, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the diameter of the cylinder in inches, and l the length of the lever by which the ſtraining force p is ſuppoſed to act, we ſhall have F × 1/8d <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = pl, and F(d <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> /8l) = p. We see in general that the ſtrength of an axle, by which it reſiſts being wrenched aſunder by twiſting, is as the cube of its diameter.</p><p>We ſee alſo that the internal parts are not acting ſo powerfully as the external. If a hole be bored out of the axle of half its diameter, the ſtrength is diminiſhed only 1/8th, while the quantity of matter is diminiſhed 1/4th. Therefore hollow axles are ſtronger than ſolid ones containing the ſame quantity of matter. Thus let the diameter be 5 and that of the hollow 4 : then the diameter of another ſolid cylinder having the ſame quantity of matter with the tube is 3. The ſtrength of the ſolid cylinder of the diameter 5 may be expreſſed by <hi rend="italic">5</hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 125. Of this the internal part (of the diameter 4) exerts 64 ; therefore the ſtrength of the tube is 125 — 64, = 61. But the ſtrength of the ſolid axle of the ſame quantity of matter and diameter 3 is 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, or 27, which is not half of that of the tube.</p><p>Engineers, therefore, have of late introduced this improvement in their machines, and the axles of caſt iron are all made hollow when their size will admit it. They have the additional advantage of being much ſtiffer, and of affording much better fixure for the flanches, which are uſed for connecting them with the wheels or levers by which they are turned and ſtrained. The ſuperiority of ſtrength of hollow tubes over ſolid cylinders is much greater in this kind of ſtrain than in the former or tranſverſe. In this laſt case the strengh of this tube would be to that of the ſolid cylinder of equal weight as 61 to 32½. nearly.</p><p>The apparatus which we mentioned on a former occaſion for trying the lateral ſtrength of a ſquare inch of solid matter, enabled us to try this theory of twiſt with all desirable accuracy. The bar which hung down from the pin in the former trials was now placed in a horizontal poſition, and loaded with a weight at the extremity. Thus it acted as a powerful lever, and enabled us to wrench aſunder ſpecimens of the ſtrongeſt materials. We found the reſults perfectly conformable to the theory, in as far as it determined the proportional ſtrength of different sizes and forms : but we found the ratio of the reſistance to twiſting to the ſimple, lateral resistance considerably different; and it was ſome time before we diſcovered the cauſe.</p><p>We had here taken the ſimpleſt view that is poſſible of the action, of coheſion in reſiſting a twill. It is frequently exerted in a very different way. When, for inſtance, an iron axle is joined to a wooden one by being driven into one end of it, the extenſions of the different circles of particles are in a very different proportion. A little conſideration will ſhow that the particles in immedate contact with the iron axle are in a ſtate of violent extenſion ; so are the particles of the exterior ſurface of the wooden part, and the intermediate parts are leſs ſtrained. It is almoſt impoſſible to aſſign the exact proportion of the coheſive forces exerted in the different parts. Numberleſs cases can be pointed out where parts of the axle are in a ſtate of compreſſion, and where it is ſtill more difficult to determine the ſtate of the other particles. We must content ourſelves with the deductions made from this ſimple case, which is fortunately the moſt common. In the experiments just now mentioned the centre of the circle is by no means the neutral point, and it is very difficult to aſcertain its place : but when this conſideration occurred to us, we eaſily freed the experiments from this uncertainty, by extending the lever to both sides, and by means of a pulley applied equal force<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0041.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0035"/>
to each arm, acting in oppoſite directions. Thus the centre became the neutral point, and the reſiſtance to twiſt was found to be 2/3ds of the ſimple lateral ſtrength.</p><p>We beg leave to mention here that our ſucceſs in theſe experiments encouraged us to extend them much farther. We hoped by theſe means to diſcover the absolute coheſion of many ſubſtances, which would have required an enormous apparatus and a moſt unmanageable force to tear them aſunder directly. But we could reaſon with confidence from the reſiſtance to twiſt (which we could eaſily meaſure), provided that we could aſcertain the proportion of the direct and the lateral ſtrengths. Our experiments on chalk, finely prepared clay, and white bees-wax (of one melting and one temperature), were very conſiſtent and ſatisfactory. But we have hitherto found great irregularities in this proportion in bodies of a fibrous texture like timber. Theſe are the moſt important cases, and we ſtill hope to be able to accompliſh our project, and to give the public ſome valuable information. This being our ſole object, it was our duty to mention the method which promiſes ſucceſs, and thus excite others to the taſk ; and it will be no mortification to us to be deprived of the honour of being the firſt who thus adds to the ſtock of experimental knowledge.</p><p>When the matter of the axle is of the moſt ſimple texture, ſuch as that of metals, we do not conceive that the length of the axle has any influence on the fracture. It is otherwiſe if it be of a fibrous texture like timber : the fibres are bent before breaking, being twisted into spirals like a cork-ſcrew. The length of the axle has ſomewhat of the influence of a lever in this caſe, and it is eaſier wrenched aſunder if long. Accordingly we have found it ſo; but we have not been able to reduce this influence to calculation.</p><p>Our readers are requeſted to accept of theſe endeavours to communicate information on this important and difficult ſubject. We are duly ſenſible of their imperfection, but flatter ourſelves that we have in many inſtances pointed out the method which muſt be purſued for improving our knowledge on this ſubject ; and we have given the Engliſh reader a more copious list of experiments on the ſtrength of materials than he will meet with in our language. Many uſeſul deductions might be made from theſe premiſes reſpecting the manner of diſpoſing and combining the ſtrength of materials in our ſtructures. The best form of joints, mortiſes, tenons, ſcarphs ; the rules for joggling, tabling, faying, fiſhing, &amp;c. practiſed in the delicate art of maſt-making, are all founded on this doctrine : but the diſcuſſion of theſe would be equivalent to writing a complete treatiſe of carpentry. We hope that this will be executed by ſome intelligent mechanician, for there is nothing in our language on this ſubject but what is almoſt contemptible ; yet there is no mechanic art that is more ſuſceptible of ſcientific treatment. Such a treatiſe, if well executed, could not fail of being well received by the public in this age of mechanical improvement.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
