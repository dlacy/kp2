<p><span class="font0">that Walachia was doomed to sink into a Turkish pashalic. The Turkish commander Mahmoud Bey became treacherously possessed&nbsp;of NaguPs young son and successor, and, sending him a prisoner to&nbsp;Stamboul, proceeded to nominate Turkish governors in the towns&nbsp;and villages of Walachia. The Walachians resisted desperately,&nbsp;elected Radul, a kinsman of Nagul, voivode, and succeeded with&nbsp;Hungarian help in defeating Malnnoud Bey at Grumatz in 1522.&nbsp;The conflict was prolonged with varying fortunes, but in 1524 the&nbsp;dogged opposition of the Walachians finally triumphed in the&nbsp;sultan’s recognition of Radul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, though Walachia thus escaped conversion into a Turkish pashalic, the battle of Mohacs in 1526 decided the long preponderance of Turkish control. The unfortunate province served&nbsp;as a transit rente for Turkish expeditions against Hungary&nbsp;and Transylvania, and was exhausted by continual requisitions.&nbsp;Turkish settlers were gradually making good their footing on&nbsp;Walachian soil, and mosques were rising in the towns and villages.&nbsp;The voivode Alexander, who succeeded in 1591, and who like his&nbsp;predecessors had bought his post of the Divan, carried the oppression still further by introducing against the capitulations a janizary&nbsp;guard, and farming out his possessions to his Turkish supporters.&nbsp;Meanwhile the Turkish governors on the Bulgarian bank never&nbsp;ceased to ravage the country, and again it seemed as if Walachia&nbsp;must share the fate of the Balkan states and succumb to the direct&nbsp;government of the Ottoman. In the depth of the national distress&nbsp;the choice of the people fell on Michael, the son of Petrushko, ban&nbsp;of Krajova, the first dignitary of the realm, who had fled to&nbsp;Transylvania to escape Alexander’s machinations. Supported at&nbsp;Constantinople by two at that time influential personages, Sigmund&nbsp;Bathori and the English ambassador, Edward Barton, and aided by&nbsp;a loan of 200,000 florins, Michael succeeded in procuring from the&nbsp;Divan the deposition of his enemy and his own nomination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genius of Michael “ the Brave ” (1593-1601) secured Walachia for a time a place in universal history. The moment for action&nbsp;was favourable. The emperor Rudolph II. had gained some&nbsp;successes over the Turks, and Sigmund Bathori, prince of&nbsp;Transylvania, had been driven by Turkish extortions to throw off&nbsp;the allegiance to the sultan. But the first obstacle to be dealt&nbsp;with was the presence of the enemy within the walls, and Michael&nbsp;had recourse to the same desperate expedient as the Montenegrins&nbsp;at a later date. By previous concert with the Moldavian voivode&nbsp;Aaron, on November 13, 1594, the Turkish guards and settlers in&nbsp;the two principalities were massacred at a given signal. Michael&nbsp;followed up these “Walachian Vespers” by an actual invasion of&nbsp;Turkish territory, and, aided by Sigmund Bathori, succeeded in&nbsp;carrying by assault Rustchuk, Silistria, and other places on the&nbsp;right bank of the lower Danube. A simultaneous invasion of&nbsp;Walachia by a large Turkish and Crim-Tatar host was successfully&nbsp;defeated ; the Tatar khan withdrew with the loss of his bravest&nbsp;followers, and, in the great victory of Mantin on the Danube&nbsp;(1595), the Turkish army was annihilated, and its leader AIustafa&nbsp;slain. The sultan now sent Sinan Pasha “the Renegade” to invade&nbsp;Walachia with 100,000 men. Alichael withdrew to the mountains&nbsp;before this overwhelming force, but, being joined by Bathori with&nbsp;a Transylvanian contingent, the voivode resumed the offensive,&nbsp;stormed Bucharest, where Sinan had entrenched a Turkish detachment, and, pursuing the main body of his forces to the Danube,&nbsp;overtook the rearguard and cut it to pieces, capturing enormous&nbsp;booty. Sinan Pasha returned to Constantinople to die, it is said,&nbsp;of vexation, and in 1597 the sultan, weary of a disastrous contest,&nbsp;sent AIichael a red flag in token of reconciliation, reinvested him&nbsp;for life in an office of which he had been unable to deprive him,&nbsp;and granted the succession to his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1599, on the definitive abdication of Sigmund Bathori in Transylvania, AIichael, in league with the imperialist forces under&nbsp;General Basta, and in connivance with the Saxon burghers, attacked&nbsp;and defeated his successor Andreas Bathori near Hermannstadt,&nbsp;and, seizing himself the reins of government, secured his proclamation as prince of Transylvania. The emperor consented to appoint&nbsp;him his “ locum tenens per Transylvaniam,&quot; and the sultan ratified&nbsp;his election. As prince of Transylvania he summoned diets in&nbsp;1599 and 1600, and, having expelled the voivode of AIoldavia,&nbsp;united under his sceptre three principalities. The partiality that&nbsp;he showed for the Rouman and Szekler parts of the population&nbsp;alienated, however, the Transylvanian Saxons, who preferred the&nbsp;direct government of the emperor. The imperial commissioner&nbsp;General Basta lent his support to the disaffected party, and&nbsp;Michael was driven out of Transylvania by a successful revolt,&nbsp;while a Polish army under Zamoyski invaded AValachia from the&nbsp;AIoldavian side. AlichaePs coolness and resource, however, never&nbsp;for a moment deserted him. He resolved to throw himself on&nbsp;the emperor, rode to Prague, won over Rudolph by his singular&nbsp;address, and, richly supplied with funds, reappeared in Transylvania&nbsp;as imperial governor. In conjunction with Basta he defeated the&nbsp;superior Transylvanian forces at Goroslo, expelling Sigmund&nbsp;Bathori, who had again aspired to the crown, and taking one&nbsp;hundred and fifty flags and forty-five cannon. But at the moment&nbsp;of his returning prosperity Basta, who had quarrelled with him&nbsp;about the supreme command of the imperial forces, procured his&nbsp;murder (August 19, 1601). Thus perished AIichael the Brave in&nbsp;the forty-third year of his age, after performing in the course of&nbsp;his short reign achievements which, considering the small resources&nbsp;at his disposal, must place his name beside those of Hunyadi and&nbsp;Sobieski in the annals of eastern Europe. Not only did he succeed&nbsp;in rolling back for a time the tide of Turkish conquest, but for&nbsp;the first and last time in modern history he united what once had&nbsp;been Trajan’s Dacia, in its widest extent, and with it the whole&nbsp;Rouman race north of the Danube, under a single sceptre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AIichaePs wife Florika and his son Petrushko were carried off into Tatar captivity, and Serban, of the Bassaraba family, was&nbsp;raised to the voivodeship of AValachia by imperialist influences.&nbsp;On his deposition by the Porte in 1610, there followed a succession&nbsp;of princes who, though still for the most part of Rouman origin,&nbsp;bought their appointment at Stamboul. Walachian contingents&nbsp;were continually employed by the Turks in their Polish wars, and&nbsp;the settlement of Greeks in an official or mercantile capacity in&nbsp;the principality provoked grave discontent, which on one occasion&nbsp;took the form of a massacre. The reign of the voivode AIatthias&nbsp;Bassaraba, who succeeded in 1633, was an interval of comparative&nbsp;prosperity, and its length, twenty-one years, forms itself a panegyric.&nbsp;He defended himself successfully against his powerful rival Vasilje&nbsp;Lupul, the voivode of Aloldavia, and his Tatar and Cossack allies,&nbsp;and found a golden key to Turkish tolerance. He appears as a&nbsp;lawgiver, translating the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica</span><span class="font0"> of Jo. Comnenus, and founded&nbsp;many churches and monasteries. His last days were embittered,&nbsp;however, by an outbreak of military anarchy. On his death the&nbsp;Turkish yoke again weighed heavier on AValachia. The old capital&nbsp;Tirgovist was considered by the Divan to be too near the Transyl&nbsp;vanian frontier, and the voivodes were accordingly compelled tc&nbsp;transfer their residence to Bucharest. The mechanical skill of the&nbsp;AValachians was found useful by the Turks, who employed them a?&nbsp;carpenters and pontonniers ; and during the siege of Vienna bj&nbsp;Kara Alustafa in 1683 the Walachian contingent, which, under the&nbsp;voivode Serban Cantacuzene, had been forced to co-operate with&nbsp;the Turks, was entrusted with the construction of the two bridges&nbsp;over the Danube above and below Vienna. The AValachian as&nbsp;well as the AIoldavian prince, who had been also forced to bring&nbsp;his contingent, maintained a secret intelligence with the besieged,&nbsp;an intelligence continued by the voivode Serban after his return&nbsp;to AValachia. The emperor granted him a diploma creating him&nbsp;count of the empire and recognizing his descent from the imperial&nbsp;house of Cantacuzene, Serban meanwhile collecting his forces foi&nbsp;an open breach with the Porte. His prudence, however, perpetually postponed the occasion, and Walachia enjoyed peace to his&nbsp;death in 1688. This peaceful state of the country gave the voivode&nbsp;leisure to promote its internal culture, and in the year of his death&nbsp;he had the satisfaction of seeing the first part of a Walachian Bible&nbsp;issue from the first printing-press of the country, which he had&nbsp;established at Bucharest. He had also caused to be compiled a&nbsp;history of AValachia, and had called to the country many teachers&nbsp;of the Greek language, whose business it was to instruct the sons oi&nbsp;the boiars in “grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately on Serban’s death the boiars, to prevent the Porte from handing over the office to the Greek adventurer who bid the&nbsp;highest, proceeded to elect his sister’s son Constantine Brancovan.&nbsp;The Turkish capidji pasha, then in Bucharest, was persuaded to put&nbsp;the caftan on his head in token of Turkish approval, and the&nbsp;patriarch of Constantinople, who was also present, and the archbishop of Walachia, Theodosius, consecrated him together at the&nbsp;high altar of the cathedral, where he took the coronation oath to&nbsp;devote his whole strength to the good of his country and received&nbsp;the boiars’ oath of submission. Brancovan, it is true, found it&nbsp;expedient to devote his predecessor’s treasure to purchasing the&nbsp;confirmation of his title from the Divan, but the account of his&nbsp;coronation ceremony remains an interesting landmark in the&nbsp;constitutional history of the country. In his foreign relations&nbsp;with the Hapsburg power he displayed the same caution as the&nbsp;voivode Serban. In spite of the victories of the margrave of Baden&nbsp;at Pojarevatz, Nish, and Widin in 1689, it was only by an exercise of&nbsp;force that the imperial troops secured winter quarters in AValachia,&nbsp;and, though after the battle of Pultava in 1709 Brancovan concluded a secret treaty with Czar Peter, he avoided giving open effect&nbsp;to it. The tranquillity which he thus obtained was employed by&nbsp;Brancovan as by his predecessor in furthering the internal wellbeing of the country, with what success is best apparent from the&nbsp;description of AValachia left by the Florentine Del Chiaro, who&nbsp;visited the country in 1709 and spent seven years there. He&nbsp;describes the stoneless AValachian plain, with its rich pastures, its&nbsp;crops of maize and millet, and woods so symmetrically planted&nbsp;and carefully kept by Brancovan’s orders that hiding in them was&nbsp;out of the question. Butter and honey were exported to supply&nbsp;the Grand Signor’s kitchen at Stamboul ; wax and cattle to Venice ;&nbsp;and the red and white wine of Walachia, notably that of Pitesti,&nbsp;to Transylvania. The Walachian horses were in demand amongst</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
