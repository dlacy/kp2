<p><span class="font1">count highly favoured by him : but no ſooner did they hear of</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">his death, than they drove out the Macedonian&nbsp;garriſons, and once more became a free people. About&nbsp;this time happened a dreadful inundation at Rhodes ;&nbsp;which, being accompanied with violent ſtorms of rain,&nbsp;and hailſtones of an extraordinary bigneſs, beat down&nbsp;many houſes, and killed great numbers of the inhabitants. As the city was built in the form of an amphitheatre, and no care had been taken to clear the pipes&nbsp;and conduits which conveyed the water into the ſea,&nbsp;the lower parts of the city were in an inſtant laid under water, ſeveral houſes quite covered, and the inha-bitants drowned before they could get to the higher&nbsp;places. As the deluge increaſed, and the violent ſhowers continued, ſome of the inhabitants made to their&nbsp;ſhips, and abandoned the place, while others miſerably&nbsp;periſhed in the waters. But while the city was thus&nbsp;threatened with utter deſtruction, the wall on a ſudden&nbsp;burſt aſunder, and the water diſcharging itſelf by a violent current into the ſea, unexpectedly delivered the inhabitants from all danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Rhodians ſuffered greatly by this unexpected accident, but ſoon retrieved their loſſes by a cloſe application to trade. During the wars which took place&nbsp;among the ſucceſſors of Alexander, the Rhodians ob-ſerved a ſtrict neutrality ; by which means they enriched themſelves ſo much, that Rhodes became one of the&nbsp;moſt opulent ſtates of that age ; inſomuch that, for the&nbsp;common good of Greece, they undertook the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">piratic&nbsp;war,</span><span class="font1"> and, at their own charge, cleared the ſeas of the&nbsp;pirates who had for many years infeſted the coaſts of&nbsp;Europe and Aſia. However, notwithſtanding the neu-trality they profeſſed, as the moſt advantageous branch-es of their commerce were derived from Egypt, they&nbsp;were more attached to Ptolemy, king of that country,&nbsp;than to any of the neighbouring princes, when there-fore Antigonus, having engaged in a war with Ptolemy&nbsp;about the iſland of Cyprus, demanded ſuccours of them,&nbsp;they earneſtly intreated him not to compel them to de-clare war againſt their ancient friend and ally. But&nbsp;this anſwer, prudent as it was, drew upon them the&nbsp;diſpleaſure of Antigonus, who immediately ordered one&nbsp;of his admirals to ſail with his fleet to Rhodes, and&nbsp;ſeize all the ſhips that came out of the harbour for&nbsp;Egypt. The Rhodians, finding their harbour blocked&nbsp;up by tlie fleet of Antigonus, equipped a good number&nbsp;of galleys, fell upon the enemy, and obliged him, with&nbsp;tlie loſs of many ſhips, to quit his ſtation. Hereupon&nbsp;Antigonus, charging them as aggreſſors, and beginners&nbsp;-of an unjuſt war, threatened to beſiege their city with&nbsp;the ſtrength of his whole army. The Rhodians endeavoured by frequent embaſſies to appeaſe his wrath ; but&nbsp;all their remonſtrances ſerved rather to provoke than&nbsp;allay his reſentment : and the only terms upon which he&nbsp;would hearken to any accommodation were, that the&nbsp;Rhodians ſhould declare war againſt Ptolemy, that they&nbsp;ſhould admit his fleet into their harbour, and that an&nbsp;hundred of the chief citizens ſhould be delivered up to&nbsp;him as hoſtages for the performance of theſe articles.&nbsp;The Rhodians ſent ambaſſadors to all their allies, and&nbsp;to Ptolemy in particular, imploring their aſſiſtance,&nbsp;and repreſenting to the latter, that their attachment to&nbsp;his intereſt had drawn upon them the danger to which&nbsp;they were expoſed. The prepartions on both ſides were&nbsp;immenſe. As Antigonus was near fourſcore years of</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">age at that time, he committed the whole management&nbsp;of the war to his ſon Demetrius, who appeared before&nbsp;the city of Rhodes with 200 ſhips of war, 170 tranſ-ports having on board 40,000 men, and 1000 other&nbsp;veſſels laden with proviſions and all ſorts of warlike engines. As Rhodes had enjoyed for many years a pro-found tranquillity, and been free from all devaſtations,&nbsp;the expectation of booty, in the plunder of ſo wealthy&nbsp;a city, allured multitudes of pirates and mercenaries to&nbsp;join Demetrius in this expedition ; inſomuch that the&nbsp;whole ſea between the continent and the iſland was&nbsp;covered with ſhips ; which ſtruck the Rhodians, who&nbsp;had a proſpect of this mighty armada from the walls,&nbsp;with great terror and conſternation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius, having landed his troops without the reach of the enemy’s machines, detached ſeveral ſmall&nbsp;bodies to lay waſte the country round the city, and cut&nbsp;down the trees and groves, employing the timber, and&nbsp;materials of the houſes without the walls, to fortify&nbsp;his camp with ſtrong ramparts and a treble paliſade ;&nbsp;which work, as many hands were employed, was finiſhed in a few days. The Rhodians, on their part, prepared for a vigorous defence. Many great commanders, who had ſignalized themſelves on other occaſions,&nbsp;threw themfelves into the city, being deſirous to try&nbsp;their ſkill in military affairs againſt Demetrius, who was&nbsp;reputed one of the moſt experienced captains in the&nbsp;conduct of ſieges that antiquity had produced. The&nbsp;beſieged began with diſmiſſing from the city all ſuch&nbsp;perſons as were uſeleſs ; and then taking an account of&nbsp;thoſe who were capable of bearing arms, they found&nbsp;that the citizens amounted to 6000, and the foreigners&nbsp;to 1000. Liberty was promiſed to all the ſlaves who&nbsp;ſhould diſtinguiſh themſelves by any glorious action,&nbsp;and the public engaged to pay the maſters their full&nbsp;ranſom. A proclamation was likewiſe made, declaring,&nbsp;that whoever died in defence of their country ſhould be&nbsp;buried at the expence of the public ; that his parents&nbsp;and children ſhould be maintained out of the treaſury ;&nbsp;that fortunes ſhould be given to his daughters ; and his&nbsp;ſons, when they were grown up, ſhould be crowned and&nbsp;preſented with a complete ſuit of armour at the great&nbsp;ſolemnity of Bacchus ; which decree kindled an incre-dible ardour in all ranks of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius, having planted all his engines, began to batter with incredible fury the walls on the ſide of the&nbsp;harbour ; but was for eight days ſucceſſively repulſed&nbsp;by the beſieged, who ſet ſire to moſt of his warlike en-gines, and thereby obliged him to allow them ſome&nbsp;reſpite, which they made good uſe of in repairing the&nbsp;breaches, and building new walls where the old ones&nbsp;were either weak or low. when Demetrius had repaired his engines, he ordered a general aſſault to be&nbsp;made, and cauſed his troops to advance with loud ſhouts,&nbsp;thinking by this means to ſtrike terror into the enemy.&nbsp;But the beſieged were ſo ſar from being intimidated,&nbsp;that they repulſed the aggreſſors with great ſlaughter,&nbsp;and performed the moſt aſtoniſhing feats of bravery.&nbsp;Demetrius returned to the aſſault next day ; but was&nbsp;in the fame manner forced to retire, after having loſt a&nbsp;great number of men, and ſome officers of diſtinction.&nbsp;He had ſeized, at his ſirſt landing, an eminence at a&nbsp;fmall diſtance from the city ; and, having fortified this&nbsp;advantageous poſt, he cauſed ſeveral batteries to be&nbsp;erected there, with engines, which inceſſantly diſcharged</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
