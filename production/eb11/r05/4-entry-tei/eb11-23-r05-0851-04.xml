It is served by the London &amp; North-Western railway, and has extensive communications by canal.

Runcorn is a sub-port of Manchester, with which it is connected by the Manchester Ship Canal, and has extensive wharfage and warehouse accommodation. The chief exports are coal, salt and pitch; but there is also a large traffic in potters’ materials. A-transporter bridge between Runcorn and Widnes, with a suspended car worked by electricity to convey passengers and vehicles (the first bridge of the kind in England) was constructed in 1902. The town possesses shipbuilding yards, iron foundries, rope works, tanneries, and soap and alkali works.</p><p>Owing to the Mersey being here fordable at low water, Runcorn was in early times of considerable military importance.

The ferry is noticed in a charter in the 12th century.</p>
