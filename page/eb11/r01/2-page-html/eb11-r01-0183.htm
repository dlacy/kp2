<p><span class="font2">The term “ reason ” is also used in several narrower senses. Thus reason is opposed to sensation, perception, feeling, desire,&nbsp;as the faculty (the existence of which is denied by empiricists)&nbsp;by which fundamental truths are intuitively apprehended.&nbsp;These fundamental truths are the causes or “ reasons ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(άρχαί)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of all derivative facts. With Kant, reason </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Vernunft)</span><span class="font2"> is the&nbsp;power of synthesizing into unity, by means of comprehensive&nbsp;principles, the concepts provided by the intellect </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Verstand),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The reason which gives a priori principles Kant calls “ Pure&nbsp;Reason ’’ (cf. the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kritik der reinen Vernunft),</span><span class="font2"> as distinguished&nbsp;from the “ Practical Reason ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(praktische Vernunft)</span><span class="font2"> which is&nbsp;specially concerned with the performance of particular actions.&nbsp;In formal logic the drawing of inferences (frequently called&nbsp;“ ratiocination,” from Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ratiocinari,</span><span class="font2"> to use the reasoning&nbsp;faculty) is classified from Aristotle downwards as deductive&nbsp;(from generals to particulars) and inductive (from particulars&nbsp;to generals); see Logic, Induction, Syllogism. In theology,&nbsp;reason, as distinguished from faith, is the human intelligence&nbsp;exercised upon religious truth whether by way of discovery or&nbsp;by way of explanation. The limits within which the reason&nbsp;may be used have been laid down differently in different&nbsp;churches and periods of thought: on the whole, modern&nbsp;Christianity, especially in the Protestant churches, tends to&nbsp;allow to reason a wide field, reserving, however, as the sphere of&nbsp;faith the ultimate (supernatural) truths of theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Greek words for reason are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">voῠs</span><span class="font2"> and λόγos, both vaguely used. In Aristotle the λόγos of a thing is its definition, in-cluding its formal cause, while the ultimate principles of a&nbsp;science are ὰ</span><span class="font0">pχαί, </span><span class="font2">the “ reasons ’’ (in a common modern sense)&nbsp;which explain all its particular facts.@@<sup>1</sup> Nous in Plato and&nbsp;Aristotle is used both widely for all the meanings which “ reason ”&nbsp;can have, and strictly for the faculty which apprehends intuitively. Thus, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Republic, vοῠs</span><span class="font2"> is the faculty which&nbsp;apprehends necessary truth, while </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">δόξα</span><span class="font2"> (opinion) is concerned&nbsp;with phenomena.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RÉAUMUR, RENÉ ANTOINE FERCHAULT DE (1683-1757), French man of science, was born on the 28th of February 1683&nbsp;at La Rochelle and received his early education there. He was&nbsp;taught philosophy in the Jesuits’ college at Poitiers, and in&nbsp;1699 went to Bourges to study civil Iaw and mathematics under&nbsp;the charge of an uncle, canon of La Sainte-Chapelle. In 1703&nbsp;he came to Paris, where he continued the study of mathematics&nbsp;and physics, and in 1708, at the early age of twenty-four, was&nbsp;elected a member of the Académie des Sciences. From this&nbsp;time onwards for nearly half a century hardly a year passed in&nbsp;which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de l’Académie</span><span class="font2"> did not contain at least one&nbsp;paper by Réaumur. At first his attention was occupied by&nbsp;mathematical studies, especially in geometry. In 1710 he&nbsp;was appointed to the charge of a great government work—the&nbsp;official description of the useful arts and manufactures—which&nbsp;led him to many practical researches that resulted in the&nbsp;establishment of manufactures new to France and the revival&nbsp;of neglected industries. For discoveries regarding iron and&nbsp;steel he was awarded a pension of 12,000 livres; but, being&nbsp;content with his ample private income, he requested that the&nbsp;money should be secured to the Académie des Sciences for the&nbsp;furtherance of experiments on improved industrial processes.&nbsp;In 1731 he became interested in meteorology, and invented&nbsp;the thermometer scale which bears his name. In 1735 family&nbsp;arrangements obliged him to aocept the post of commander&nbsp;and intendant of the royal and military order of Saint-Louis;&nbsp;he discharged his duties with scrupulous attention, but declined&nbsp;the emoluments. He took great delight in the systematic&nbsp;study of natural history. His friends often called him the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">Pliny of the 18th century. He loved retirement and lived much at his country residences, at one of which, La Bermondière (Maine), he met with a fall from horseback, the effects of&nbsp;which proved fatal on the 17th of October 1757. He bequeathed&nbsp;his manuscripts, which filled 138 portfolios, and his natural&nbsp;history collections to the Academie des Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reaumur’s scientific papers deal with nearly all branches of science; his first, in 1708, was on a general problem in&nbsp;geometry; his last, in 1756, on the forms of birds’ nests. He&nbsp;proved experimentally the fact that the strength of a rope is&nbsp;less than the sum of the strengths of its separate strands. He&nbsp;examined and reported on the auriferous rivers, the turquoise&nbsp;mines, the forests and the fossil beds of France. He devised&nbsp;the method of tinning iron that is still employed, and investigated the differences between iron and steel, correctly showing&nbsp;that the amount of carbon (sulphur in the language of the old&nbsp;chemistry) is greatest in cast iron, less in steel, and least in&nbsp;wrought iron. His book on this subject (1722) was translated&nbsp;into English and German. The thermometer by which he is&nbsp;now best remembered was constructed on the principle of&nbsp;taking the freezing-point of water as o°, and graduating the&nbsp;tube into degrees each of which was one-thousandth of the&nbsp;volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark.&nbsp;It was an accident dependent on the dilatability of the particular quality of alcohol employed which made the boiling-point of water 8o°; and mercurial thermometers the stems of&nbsp;which are graduated into eighty equal parts between the freezing- and boiling-points of water are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font2"> Réaumur thermometers&nbsp;in anything but name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Réaumur wrote much on natural history. Early in life he described the locomotor system of the Echinodermata, and showed&nbsp;that the supposed vulgar error of Crustaceans replacing their lost&nbsp;limbs was an actual fact, ln 1710 he wrote a paper on the&nbsp;possibility of spiders being used to produce silk, which was so&nbsp;celebrated at the time that the Chinese emperor Kang-he caused&nbsp;a translation of it to be made. He treated also of botanical and&nbsp;agricultural matters, and devised processes for preserving birds&nbsp;and eggs. He elaborated a system of artificial incubation, and&nbsp;made important observations on the digestion of carnivorous and&nbsp;graminivorous birds. His greatest work is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires pour&nbsp;servir à l'histoire des insectes,</span><span class="font1"> 6 vols., with 267 plates (Amsterdam,&nbsp;1734-42). It describes the appearance, habits and locality of all&nbsp;the known insects except the beetles, and is a marvel of patient&nbsp;and accurate observation. Among other important facts stated&nbsp;in this work are the experiments which enabled Réaumur to prove&nbsp;the correctness of Peyssonel's hypothesis, that corals are animals&nbsp;and not plants.</span></p>
