<p><span class="font2">This ſuppoſed reeompenſe in value is the reaſon why the iſſue in tail is held to be barred by a common recovery. For, if the reeoveree ſhould obtain a recom-penſe in lands from the-common vouchee (which there&nbsp;is a poſſibility in contemplation of law, though a very&nbsp;improbable one, of hiε doing), theſe lands would ſup-ply the place of thoſe ſo recovered from him by co!lu-dſion, and would deſcend to the iſſue in tail. The reafon&nbsp;will alfo hold with equal force as to meſt remainder-mien and reverſioners, to whom the poſſibility will re-main land revert, as a full recompenfe for the reality&nbsp;which they were otherwiſe entitled to: but it will not&nbsp;always hold ; and therefore, as Pigott ſays, the judges&nbsp;have been even </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ajluti,</span><span class="font2"> in inventing other reaſons to&nbsp;maintain the authority of recoveries. And, in par-ticular, it hath been ſaid, that though the eſtate-tail is&nbsp;gone from the recoveree ; yet it is not deſtroyed, but&nbsp;only transferred, and ſtill ſubſiſts ; and will ever con-tin ue to ſubſiſt (by conſtruction of law) in the reco-veror, his heirs and aſſigns : and as the eſtate-tail fo&nbsp;continues to fubſiſt for ever, the remainders or reversions&nbsp;expectant on the determination of ſuch eſtate-tail can&nbsp;never take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To ∙fiιch aukward ſhifts, ſuch ſubtile refinements, and inch ſtrafige reaſoning, were our anceſtors obliged&nbsp;to have recourſe, in order to get the better of-that ſtub-born ſtatute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">de donis.</span><span class="font2"> The deſign for which theſe contrivances were ſet on foot, was certainly laudable ; the&nbsp;tmrivetιing the fetters of eſtatestail, which were attended with a legion of miſchiefs to the commonwealth:&nbsp;but, while we applaud the end, we cannot but admire&nbsp;the means, our modern courts of juſtice have indeed&nbsp;adopted a move manly way of treating the ſubject ; by&nbsp;eonſidering common recoveries, in no other light than&nbsp;as the formal mode of conveyance by which tenant in&nbsp;tail is enabled to aliene his lands. But, ſince the ill&nbsp;■eonſequences of fettered inheritances are now generally&nbsp;feeai arid allowed, and of courſe the utility and expedience of fitting them at liberty are apparent, it hath&nbsp;often been wiſhed that the proceſs of this conveyance&nbsp;was ſhortened, and rendered leſs ſubject to niceties, by&nbsp;either totally repealing the ſtatute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">de donis ;</span><span class="font2"> which per-haps,- by reviving the old doctrine of conditional fees,&nbsp;might give birth to many litigations : or by veſting&nbsp;in every tenant in tail, of full age, the fame abſolute&nbsp;feeſſimple at once, which now he may obtain whenever&nbsp;•he pleafis, by the colhſſive fiction of a common recovery ; though this might poffibly bear hard upon thofe&nbsp;’ir. remainder or reverſion, by abridging the chances&nbsp;they would otherwiſe frequently have, as no recovery&nbsp;can be ſuffered in the intervals between term and term,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. which ſometimes continue for -near five months toge-ther : or, laſtly, by empowering the tenant in tad.to bar the eſtate-tail by a ſolemn deed, to be made in&nbsp;term-time, and enrolled in ſome·court of.record ; which&nbsp;is liable to neither of the other objections, and is warranted not only- by .the uſage of our American colonies, but by the precedent of the ſtatute 21 Jac. I. c. ∣ 9&nbsp;which, in the. cafi of !a bankrupt tenant in tail, empowers his commiſſioners tq fc4l the eſtate at any t<sub>4</sub>iae<sub>y&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> by </span><span class="font2">deed indented and enrolled. Aud if, in ſo national</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">a concern, th¢ emoluments of </span><span class="font1">the officers concerned in </span><span class="font2">paſſing recoveries are thought to be worthy attention,&nbsp;thofe might be provided for in the fees to be paid upon each enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. The force and effect of common recoveries may appear, from what has been ſaid, to be an abſolute bar&nbsp;not only of all eſtates tail, but of remaindeιs and re-verſions expectant on the determination of ſuch eſtates.&nbsp;So that a tenant in tail may, by this method of aſſu-rance, convey the lands held iu tail to the recoverer,&nbsp;his heirs and affigns, abſolutely free and diſcharged of&nbsp;all conditions and limitations· in tail, and of all remainders and reverſions. But, by ſtatute 34. &amp; 35 H. VIIL&nbsp;c. 2c. no recovery had againſt tenant in tail of the&nbsp;king’s gift, whereof the. remainder or reverſion is in the&nbsp;king, ſhall bar ſuch eſtate-tail, or the remainder or reverſion oſ the crown. And by the ſtatute 11 H. VIL·&nbsp;c. 2c. no woman, after her huftand<sup>,</sup>6 death, ſhall fuffer&nbsp;a recovery of lands fettled on her by her huſhand, or&nbsp;fettled on her huſhand and her by any of his anceſtors-And by ſtatute 14 Eliz. c. 8. no tenant for life, of&nbsp;any fort, can fiιffer a recovery fo a3 to bind them in&nbsp;remainder or reverſion. For which reaſon, if there be&nbsp;tenant for life, with remainder in tail, and other remainders over, and the tenant for Iife is deſirous to fnffer a valid recovery, either he, or the tenant to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">precipe</span><span class="font2"> by him made, muſt vouch the remainder-man in&nbsp;tail, otherwiſe the recovery is void : but if he does&nbsp;vouch ſuch remainder-man, and he appears and vouches&nbsp;the common vouchee, it is then good ; for if a man be&nbsp;vouched and appears, and ſuffers the recovery to be had,&nbsp;it is as effectual to ‘ bar the eſtate-tail as if he himfclf&nbsp;were the recoveree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all recoveries, it is neceſſary that the recoveree,. or tenant to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prαcipe,</span><span class="font2"> as he is ufiually called, be actually fiifid of the freehold, elfi the recovery is void.&nbsp;For all actions to recover the fiiſin of lands muſt be&nbsp;brought againſt the actual tenant of the freehold, elſe&nbsp;the fuit will loſe its effect ; ſince the freehold cannot&nbsp;be recovered of him who has it not. And, though theſe&nbsp;recoveries are in themfelves fabulous and fictitious, yet&nbsp;it is neceſſary that there be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actores 1αbui&lt;ε.</span><span class="font2"> properly qualified. But the nicety thought by ſome modern practitioners to.be requiſite in conveying the legal freehold, in order to make a good tenant to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pracipe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">is removed bv the proviſions of-the ſtatute 14 Geo. IL&nbsp;c. 20. which enacts, with a retroſpect and conformity&nbsp;to tlιe ancient rul¢ of law, that, though the legal freehold be veſted in leſſees, yet thoſe who are entitled to&nbsp;the next freehold eſtate in remainder, or reverſion, may&nbsp;make a good tenant to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rrœcipe ;</span><span class="font2"> and that, though&nbsp;the deed or fine which creates ſuch tenant be fiιbie-quent to the judgment of recovery, yet iſ it be in the&nbsp;ſame term, the recovery ſhall be valid in law : and that&nbsp;though the recovery itfilf·do not appear to be entered,&nbsp;or be not regularly entered on record, yet the deed&nbsp;to make a tenant to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prœàpe</span><span class="font2"> and declare the uſes&nbsp;of the recovery, ſhall after a poſſeſſion of 20 years be&nbsp;ſufficient evidence on behalf of a purchaſer for valuable&nbsp;conſideration, that ſuch recovery was duly ſuffered.</span></p>
