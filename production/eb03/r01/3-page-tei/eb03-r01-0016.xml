Sect. i. § 1.</p><p>In the Philofophical Tranſactions for 1793, we have the following account of two rainbows ſeen by the Rev. Mr St urges.</p><p>" Οη the evening of the 9th of July 1792, between ſeven and eight o’clock, at Alverſtoke, near Goſport, on the ſea-coaſt of Hampſhire, there came up, in the ſonth-eaſt, a cloud with a thunder-ſhower ; while the fun ſhone bright, low in the horizon to the north-weſt.</p><p>“ In this ſhower two primary rainbows appeared, AB and AC, not concentric, but touching each other</p><p>at A, in the ſouth part of the horizon ; with a ſecon-dary bow to each, DE andDF (the laſt very faint, but diſcernible), which touched likewiſe at D. Both the primary were very' vivid for a conſiderable time, and at different times nearly equally ſo ; but the bow AB was "* moſt permanent, was a larger ſegment of a circle, and at laſt, after the other had vaniſhed, became almoſt a ſemi-circle ; the ſun being near ſetting. It was a perfect calm, and the ſea was as ſmooth as glaſs.</p><p>" If I fnight venture to offer a ſolution of this ap-pearance, it would be as follows. I conſider the bow AB as the true one, produced by the ſun itſelf ; and the other, AC, as produced by the reflection of the ſun from the ſea, which, in its perfectly fmooth ſtate, acted as a ſpeculum. The direction of the ſea, between the Iſle of wight and the land, was to the north-weſt in a line with the ſun, as it was then ſituated. The image reflected from the water, having its rays iffuing from a point lower than the real ſun, and in a line coming from beneath the horizon, would conſequently form a bow higher than the true one AB. And the ſhores, by which that narrow part of the ſea is bounded, would before the ſun’s actual ſetting intercept its rays from the ſurſhce of the water, and cauſe the bow AC, which I ſuppoſe to be produced by the reflection, to diſappear before the other.”</p><p>The marine or ſea bow is a phenomenon which maybe frequently obſerved in a much ag⅛ated ſea, and is occaſioned by the wind ſweeping part of the waves, and carrying them aloft ; which when they fall down are refracted by the ſun’s rays, which paint the colours of the bow juſt as in a common ſhower. Thefe bows are often ſeen when a veffel is ſailing with conſiderable force, and daſhing the waves around her, which are raiſed partly by tlre action βf the ſhip and partly by the force of the wind, and, falling down, they form a rainbow ; and they are alſo often occaſioned by the daſhing βf the waves againſt the rocks on ſhore.</p><p>In the Philofophical Tranſactions, it is obſerved by F. Bourzes, that the colours of the marine rain-bow are leſs lively, leſs diſtinct, and of ſhorter con-tinuance, than thoſe of the common bow ; that therc are ſcarce above two colours diſtinguiſhable, a dark yel-low on the ſide next the ſun, and a pale green on the oppoſite ſide. But they are more numerous, there be-ing ſometimes 20 or 30 ſeen together.</p><p>To this claſs of bows may be referred a kind of white or colourlefs rainbows, which Mcntzelius and others affirm to have ſeen at noon-day. M. Marlotte, in his fourth <hi rend="italic">Efifαi de Phyſique,</hi>  ſays, theſe bows are formed in miſts, as the others are in ſhowers ; and adds,· that he has ſeen ſeveral both after ſun-riſing and in the night. The want of colours he attributes to the fmallneſs of the va∙ pours which compofe the miſt ; but perhaps it is rather ſhom the exceeding .tenuity of the little veficulæ of the vapour, which being only little watery pellicles bloated with air, the rays of light undergo but little refraction in paſſing out of air into them ; too little to ſeparate the differently coloured rays, &amp;c. Hence the l ays are reflected from them, compounded as they came, that is, white. Rohault mentions * coloured rainbows on the graſs ; formed by the reſractions of the ſun’s rays in the morning dew. Rainbows have been alfo produced by the reflection of the ſun from a river ; and in the Philofophical Tranſactions, V0I. L. p. 2 g 4. we</p></body></text></TEI>
