<p><span class="font0">but we continue to be of the opinion that plain roofs are greatly superior in point of strength, and therefore should&nbsp;be adopted in cases where the main difficulty is to insure&nbsp;this necessary circumstance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It would appear very neglectful to omit an account of the roofs put on round buildings, such as domes, cupolas,&nbsp;and the like. They appear to be the most difficult tasks in&nbsp;the carpenter’s art. But the difficulty lies entirely in the&nbsp;mode of framing, or what the French call the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trait de charpenterie.</span><span class="font0"> The view which we are taking of the subject, as&nbsp;a part of mechanical science, has little connection with this.&nbsp;It is plain, that whatever form of a truss is excellent in a&nbsp;square building, must be equally so as one of the frames of&nbsp;a round one ; and the only difficulty is how to manage their&nbsp;mutual intersections at the top. Some of them must be&nbsp;discontinued before they reach that length, and common&nbsp;sense will teach us to cut them short alternately, and always leave as many, that they may stand equally thick as&nbsp;at their first springing from the base of the dome. Thus&nbsp;the length of the purlins, which reach from truss to truss,&nbsp;will never be too great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The truth is, that a round building which gathers in at top, like a glass-house, a potter’s kiln, or a spire steeple, instead of being the most difficult to erect with stability, is&nbsp;of all others the easiest. Nothing can show this more forcibly than daily practice, where they are run up without&nbsp;centres and without scaffoldings ; and it requires gross blunders indeed in the choice of their outline to put them in&nbsp;much danger of falling from a want of equilibrium. In like&nbsp;manner, a dome of carpentry can hardly fall, give it what&nbsp;shape or what construction you will. It </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span><span class="font0"> fall, unless&nbsp;some part of it flies out at the bottom. An iron hoop round&nbsp;it, or straps at the joinings of the trusses and purlins, which&nbsp;make an equivalent to a hoop, will effectually secure it.&nbsp;And as beauty requires that a dome shall spring almost&nbsp;perpendicularly from the wall, it is evident that there is&nbsp;hardly any thrust to force out the walls. The only part&nbsp;where this is to be guarded against is where the tangent is&nbsp;inclined about forty or fifty degrees to the horizon. Here&nbsp;it will be proper to make a course of firm horizontal joinings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We doubt not but that domes of carpentry will now be raised of great extent. The Halle du Bled at Paris, of two&nbsp;hundred feet in diameter, was the invention of an intelligent&nbsp;carpenter, the Sieur Moulineau. He was not by any means&nbsp;a man of science, but had much more mechanical knowledge&nbsp;than artisans usually have, and was convinced that a very thin&nbsp;shell of timber might not only be so shaped as to be nearly&nbsp;in equilibrio, but that, if hooped or firmly connected horizontally, it would have all the stiffness that was necessary ;&nbsp;and he presented his project to the magistracy of Paris. The&nbsp;grandeur of it pleased them, but they doubted bf its possibility. Being a great public work, they prevailed on the&nbsp;Academy of Sciences to consider it. The members who&nbsp;were competent judges were instantly struck with the justness of M. Moulineau’s principles, and astonished that a&nbsp;thing so plain had not been long familiar to every house-carpenter. It quickly became an universal topic of conversation, dispute, and cabal, in the polite circles of Paris. But&nbsp;the academy having given a very favourable report of their&nbsp;opinion, the project was immediately carried into execution,&nbsp;and soon completed ; and now stands as one of the great&nbsp;exhibitions of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The construction of this dome is the simplest thing that can be imagined. The circular ribs which compose it consist of planks nine feet long, thirteen inches broad, and&nbsp;three inches thick ; and each rib consists of three of these&nbsp;planks bolted together in such a manner that two points&nbsp;meet. A rib is begun, for instance, with a plank of three&nbsp;feet long standing between one of six feet and another of&nbsp;nine ; and this is continued to the head of it. No machinery&nbsp;was necessary for carrying up such small pieces, and the&nbsp;whole went up like a piece of bricklayer’s work. At various&nbsp;distances these ribs were connected horizontally by purlins&nbsp;and iron straps, which made so many hoops to the whole.&nbsp;When the work had reached such a height that the distance of the ribs was two thirds of the original distance,&nbsp;every third rib was discontinued, and the space was left&nbsp;open and glazed. When carried so much higher that the&nbsp;distance of the ribs is one third of the original distance,&nbsp;every second rib, now consisting of two ribs very near each&nbsp;other, is in like manner discontinued, and the void is glazed.&nbsp;A little above this the heads of the ribs are framed into a&nbsp;circular ring of timber, which forms a wide opening in the&nbsp;middle ; over which is a glazed canopy or umbrella, with an&nbsp;opening between it and the dome for allowing the heated&nbsp;air to get out. All who have seen this dome say that it is&nbsp;the most beautiful and magnificent object they have ever&nbsp;beheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only difficulty which occurs in the construction of wooden domes is when they are unequally loaded, by carrying a heavy lanthorn or cupola in the middle. In such a&nbsp;case, if the dome were a mere shell, it would be crushed&nbsp;in at the top, or the action of the wind on the lanthorn&nbsp;might tear it out of its place. Such a dome must therefore&nbsp;consist of trussed frames. Mr Price has given a very good&nbsp;one in his plate OP, though much stronger in the trusses&nbsp;than there was any occasion for. This causes a great loss&nbsp;of room, and throws the lights of the lanthorn too far up.&nbsp;It is evidently copied from Sir Christopher Wren’s dome of&nbsp;St Paul’s Church in London ; a model of propriety in its&nbsp;particular situation, but by no means a general model of a&nbsp;wooden dome. It rests on the brick cone within it ; and&nbsp;Sir Christopher has very ingeniously made use of it for stiffening this cone, as any intelligent person will perceive by&nbsp;attending to its construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 28 presents a dome executed in the Register Office in Edinburgh by James and Robert Adam, and is very&nbsp;agreeable to mechanical principles. The span is fifty feet&nbsp;clear, and the thickness is only four and a half feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We cannot take leave of the subject without taking some notice of what we have already spoken of with commendation by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Norman roofs.</span><span class="font0"> We called them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Norman,</span><span class="font0"> because they were frequently executed by that people&nbsp;soon after their establishment in Italy and other parts of the&nbsp;south of Europe, and became the prevailing taste in all the&nbsp;great baronial castles. Their architects were rivals to the&nbsp;Saracens and Moors, who about that time built many Christian churches ; and the architecture which we now call&nbsp;Gothic seems to have arisen from their joint labours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principle of a Norman roof is extremely simple. The rafters all abutted on joggled&nbsp;king-posts AF, BG, CH, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(fig. 29), and braces or ties were then disposed in the intervals. In the middle of the&nbsp;roof HB and HD are evidently ties in a state of extension, whilst the post CH&nbsp;is compressed by them. Towards the walls on each side,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
