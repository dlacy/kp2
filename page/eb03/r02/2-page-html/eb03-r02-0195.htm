<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font0">projectors of the plan were Severua and Celer; two bold and enterpriſing men, who ſoon after put the&nbsp;emperor upon a ſtill more expenſive and arduous undertaking, namely, that of cutting a canal through hard&nbsp;rocks and ſteep mountains, from the lake Avernus tσ&nbsp;the mouth of the Tiber, ι6</span><span class="font3">□</span><span class="font0"> miles in length, and of&nbsp;ſuch breadth that two galleys of five ranks of oars might&nbsp;eaſily paſs abreaſt. His view in this was to open a&nbsp;communication between Rome and Campania, free from&nbsp;the troubles and dangers of the ſea ; for, this very year,&nbsp;a great number of veſſels laden with corn were ſhip-wrecked at Miſenum, the pilots chooſing rather to venture out in a violent ſtorm, than not to arrive at the&nbsp;time they were expected by Nero. For the executing&nbsp;of this great undertaking, the emperor ordered the priſoners from all parts to be tranſported into Italy ; and&nbsp;ſuch as were convicted, whatever their ’Crimes were, to&nbsp;be condemned only to his works. Nero, who undertook nothing with more ardour and readineſs than what&nbsp;was deemed impoſſible, expended incredible ſums in this&nbsp;raſh undertaking, and exerted all his might to cut&nbsp;through the mountains adjoining to the lake Avernus ;&nbsp;but, not being able to remove by art the obſtacles of nature, he was in the end obliged to drop the enterpriſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ground that was not taken up by the foundations of Nero’s own palace, he aſſigned for houſes, which were not placed, as after the burning of the&nbsp;city by the Gauls, at random, and without order ; but&nbsp;the ſtreets were laid out regularly, ſpacious and ſtraight ;&nbsp;the edifices reſtrained to a certain height, perhaps of&nbsp;70 feet, according to the plan of Auguſtus ; the courts&nbsp;were widened ; and to all the great houſes which ſtood&nbsp;by themſelves, and were called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ifles,</span><span class="font0"> large porticoes&nbsp;were added, which Nero engaged to raiſe at his own&nbsp;expence, and to deliver to each proprietor the ſquares&nbsp;about them clear from all rubbiſh. He likewiſe promiſed rewards according to every man’s rank and ſub-ſtance ; and fixed a day for the performance of his&nbsp;promiſe, on condition that againſt that day their ſeveral&nbsp;houſes and palaces were finiſhed. He moreover made&nbsp;the following wiſe regulations to obviate ſuch a dreadful&nbsp;calamity for the future ; to wit, That the new buildings&nbsp;ſhould be raiſed to a certain height without timber ;&nbsp;that they ſhould be arched with ſtone from the quarries&nbsp;of Gabii and Alba, which were proof againſt fire ;&nbsp;that over the common ſprings, which were diverted by&nbsp;private men for their own uſes, overſeeers ſhould be&nbsp;placed to prevent that abuſe ; that every citizen ſhould&nbsp;have ready in his houſe ſome machine proper to extinguiſh the fire ; that no wall ſhould be common to two&nbsp;houſes, but every houſe be incloſed within its own peculiar walls, &amp;c. Thus the city in a ſhort time roſe out&nbsp;of its aſhes with new luſtre, and more beautiful than&nbsp;ever. However, ſome believed, that the ancient form&nbsp;was more conducing to health, the rays of the ſun being hardly felt on account of the narrowneſs of the&nbsp;ſtreets, and the height of the buildings, whereas now&nbsp;there was no ſhelter againſt the ſcorching heat. We&nbsp;are told, that Nero deſigned to extend the walls to Oſtia, and to bring from thence by a canal the ſea into the&nbsp;city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The emperor uſed every art to throw the odium of this conflagration upon the Chriſtians, who were at&nbsp;that time gaining ground in Rome, Nothing could</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">be more dreadful than the perſecution raiſed againſt them upon this falſe accuſation, of which an account is given&nbsp;under the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">EccLfiaſlical HιsτoBr.</span><span class="font0"> Hitherto, ho v-ever, the citizens of Rome ſeemed comparatively exempted from his cruelties, which chiefly fell upon ſtrangers and his neareſt connections ; but a conſpiracy&nbsp;formed againſt him by Pifσ, a man of great power and&nbsp;integrity, which was prematurely diſcovered, opened a&nbsp;new train of ſuſpicions that deſtroyed many of the principal families in Rome. This conſpiracy, in which ſeveral of the chief men of the city were concerned, was&nbsp;firſt diſcovered by the indiſcreet zeal of a woman named&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epicharis,</span><span class="font0"> who, by ſome means now unknown, had been&nbsp;let into the plot, which ſhe revealed to Voluſius, a tribune, in order to prevail upon him to be an accomplice.&nbsp;Voluſius, inſtead of coming into her deſign, went and&nbsp;diſcovered what he had learned to Nero, who immedi-ately put Epicharis in priſon. Soon after, a freedman&nbsp;belonging to Scænius, one of the accomplices, made a&nbsp;farther diſeovery. The conſpirators were examined&nbsp;apart ; and as their teſtimonies differed, they were put&nbsp;to the torture. Natalis was the firſt who made a con-feſſion of his own guilt and that of many others. Scae-nius gave a liſt of the conſpirators ſtill more ample.&nbsp;Lucan, the poet, was amongſt the number ; and he, like&nbsp;the reſt, in order to ſave himſelf, ſtill farther enlarged&nbsp;the catalogue, naming, among others, Attilia, his own&nbsp;mother. Epicharis was now, therefore, again called&nbsp;upon and put to the torture ; but her fortitude was -proof againſt all the tyrant’s cruelty ; neither ſcourging&nbsp;nor burning, nor all the malicious methods uſed by the&nbsp;executioners, could extort the ſmalleſt conſeſſion. She&nbsp;was therefore remanded to priſon, with orders to have&nbsp;her tortures renewed the day following. In the meantime, ſhe found an opportunity of ſti angling herſelf&nbsp;with her handkerchief, by hanging it againſt the back&nbsp;of her chair. On the diſeoveries already made, Piſo,&nbsp;Lateranus, Fennius Rufus, Subrius Flavius; Sulpicius&nbsp;Aſper, Veſtinus the conſul, and numberleſs others, were&nbsp;all executed without mercy. But the two moſt remarkable perſonages who fell on this occaſion were Seneca the philoſopher, and Lucan the poet, who was&nbsp;his nephew. It is not certainly known whether Seneca was really concerned in this conſpiracy or not.—-This-great man had for ſome time perceived the outrageous conduct of his pupil ; and, finding himſelf incapable of controuling his ſavage diſpoſition, had retired from court into ſolitude and privacy. However,&nbsp;his retreat did not now protect him ; for Nero, either&nbsp;having real teſtimony againſt him, or elſe hating him'&nbsp;for his virtues, ſent a tribune to inform him that he was&nbsp;ſuſpected as an accomplice, and ſoon after ſent him an&nbsp;order to put himſelf to death, with which he complied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this manner was the whole city filled with ſlaLighter, and frightful inſtances of treachery. No maſter was ſecure from the vengeance of his ſlaves, nor even&nbsp;parents from the baſer attempts of their children. Not·&nbsp;only throughout Rome, ſhut the whole country round,&nbsp;bodies of ſoldiers were ſeen in purſuit of the ſuſpected&nbsp;and the guilty. Whole crowds of wretches loaded with&nbsp;chains were led every day to the gates of the palace, to&nbsp;wait their ſentence from the tyrant’s own lips. He airways j&gt;refided at the torture in perſen, attended by Ti-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
