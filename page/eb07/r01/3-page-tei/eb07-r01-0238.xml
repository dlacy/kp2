The cardinal, for his part, was unmoved, and by his reasonings overthrew what was thought to be determined against him ; so that, instead of being disgraced, he from that moment became more powerful than ever. He punished all his enemies in the same manner as they would have punished him ; and the day which produced this event, so glorious to Cardinal de Richelieu, was called the <hi rend="italic">day of dupes.</hi>  This able minister had from thence forward an ascendency over the king’s mind ; and he now resolved to humble the excessive pride of the house of Austria. For that purpose he concluded a treaty with Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden, for carrying the war into the heart of Germany. He also entered into a league with the duke of Bavaria ; secured Lorraine ; raised a part of the princes of the empire against the emperor; treated with the Dutch to continue the war against Spain ; favoured the Catalans and Portuguese till they shook off the Spanish yoke ; and, in short, took so many different measures, that he accomplished his design ; and after having carried on the war with success, was thinking of concluding it by a peace, when he died at Paris on the 4th of December 1642, aged fifty-eight. He was interred in the Sorbonne, where a magnificent mausoleum is erected to his memory. This great politician made the arts and sciences flourish ; formed the botanical garden at Paris, called the <hi rend="italic">king’s garden ;</hi>  founded the French academy ; established the royal printing-house ; erected the palace afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Le Palais Royal,</hi>  which he presented to the king ; and rebuilt the Sorbonne with a magnificence that appears truly royal. Besides his books of controversy and piety, there pass under the name of this minister, a Journal, in 2 vols. 12mo ; and a Political Testament, in 12mo; all treating of politics and state affairs.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richelieu, or </hi><hi rend="italic">Sοrell,</hi>  a river of Lower Canada, flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Champlain to the great St Lawrence. It is the principal channel by which the waters of the lake are conveyed to the latter river ; and by being made navigable for vessels of large size throughout its whole extent, it would afford a most convenient means of commercial intercourse with the interior of New York, and form a direct chain of communication with the great western republic. This river is remarkable for being much narrower at its embouchure than at the place from which it flows. From its mouth to the basin of Chamblay it is about two hundred and fifty yards wide ; thence to the Isle du Portage the breadth is five hundred yards ; beyond this it expands to double that size, and continues to enlarge up to St John’s, from which there is a ship-navigation to the towns on Lake Champlain. From Chamblay downwards to the St Lawrence the current is regular and gentle ; but from Lake Champlain to the basin it is hurried, in some places violent, and in others broken by rapids. The channel is, however, of great value and importance, and the medium of considerable trade.</p><p>RICHELIEU <hi rend="italic">Islands,</hi>  a cluster of islands, about a hundred in number, in the river St Lawrence, situated at the southwest entrance of Lake St Peter. They lie low, and are liable to be overflowed in spring, when the lake is swelled by the melting of snow and ice. Some of them afford good pasturage for cattle, and they all abound with wild fowl.</p><p>RICHES, a word used always in the plural number, means wealth, money, possession, or a splendid sumptuous appearance. When used to express the fortune of private persons, whether patrimonial or acquired, it signifies <hi rend="italic">opulence ;</hi>  a term which expresses not the enjoyment, but the possession, of numerous superfluities. By the riches of a state or kingdom we mean the produce of industry, of commerce, of different incorporated bodies, of the internal and external administration of the principal members of which the society is composed.</p><p>RICHMOND, a city, port of entry, and the metropolis of Virginia, one of the United States of North America.</p><p>It is situated on the north bank of James River, just below <hi rend="sup"/>the falls, one hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of the <hi rend="sub"/>river, and one hundred and twenty-three south-west from Washington. The situation of tllis city is alike picturesque, salubrious, and favourable for commerce. The public buildings are numerous, and some considerable manufactures are here carried on. The capitol, a handsome structure, occupies a commanding situation on a rising ground. Among the churches, that called the Monumental Church is most beautiful and conspicuous. It is erected on the spot where, in 1811, the theatre of Richmond w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as burned to the ground during the performance, and above seventy persons perished in the flames. A monument in front commemorates the event, and hence the name of the church. There are a number of other religious houses, a sufficiency of good schools, and a well-regulated penitentiary. Richmond is the natural depot of tobacco, wheat, and hemp, raised in the populous county watered by the river. The falls extend six miles, during which space the James descends eighty feet. A canal passes around these falls, and the river is navigable for batteaux two hundred and twenty miles above them ; by this means the city is connected with a very extensive and productive back country. The inland, coasting, and foreign trade is extensive. Manchester, on the opposite side of the river, is connected with it by means of bridges. In 1830 the population amounted to 16,060 ; in 1839 it may be estimated at about 20,000. Long. 77. 21. W. Lat. 37. 32. N.    (r. R. r.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richmond, a town of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Kingston, nine miles from London, on the right bank of the river Thames, over which is an elegant bridge leading to Twickenham. It was anciently called Sheen, and a palace adjoining was long the residence of our monarchs. The park still belongs to the crown. A hill rises from the town, of great celebrity for the extent and beauty of the prospect which it affords. The brow of the hill has a delightful promenade, and is adorned by residences of great taste and magnificence, and by hotels, where every accommodation that luxury can desire is supplied, though at the most extravagant prices. Other houses of the purest taste are built along the bank, and to the edge of the river. The vicinity to the royal gardens of Kew form an inducement to a residence at this delightful place, which is one of the desirable retreats from the metropolis. It has a neat parish church, or rather chapel to Kingston. The population amounted in 1801 to 4628, in 1811 to 5219, in 1821 to 5994, and in 1831 to 7243.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richmond, a market and borough town of the north riding of the county of York, 254 miles from London. It stands on the east side of a steep hill rising from the banks of the river Swale, which nearly encircles the town. It is finely situated, and well built. It was fortified in ancient times, and probably more populous than it is at present. It now gives the title of duke to one branch of the illegitimate descendants of Charles H. It returns two members to the House of Commons, and is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. The country around it is celebrated for its breed of horses, and annual races are still held near it. There is a good market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1821 to 3546, and in 1831 to 3900.</hi></p><p>RICKMANSWORTH, a market-town of the county of Hertford. It is in the hundred of Cashio, seventeen miles from London, and stands at the spot where the river Gade falls into the Colne, which latter forms a part of the Grand Junction Canal. It is also near the course of the railway by which London is connected with Birmingham, and is thus highly favoured with respect to the facilities of communication. The church is a fine large fabric of an ancient date. The town has some trade in straw-hats and in</p></body></text></TEI>
