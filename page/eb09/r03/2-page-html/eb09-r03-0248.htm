<p><span class="font2">and when the medical college, which he had helped to found, was absorbed by the university of Pennsylvania in&nbsp;1791 he became professor of the institutes of medicine&nbsp;and of clinical practice, succeeding in 1805 to the chair of&nbsp;the theory and practice of physic. He was the central&nbsp;figure in the medical world of Philadelphia, as Cullen was&nbsp;at Edinburgh and Boerhaave at Leyden. Much of his&nbsp;influence and success was due to his method and regularity&nbsp;of life on the Franklin model. During the thirty years&nbsp;that he attended the Pennsylvania Hospital as physician,&nbsp;he is said to have never missed his daily visit and never to&nbsp;have been more than ten minutes late. Notwithstanding&nbsp;a weak chest, which troubled him the greater part of his&nbsp;life, he got through an enormous amount of work, literary&nbsp;and other ; he was a systematic early riser, and his leisure&nbsp;at the end of the day was spent in reading poetry, history,&nbsp;the moral sciences, and the like, with his pen always in his&nbsp;hand. His temperament was of the gentle sort, and his&nbsp;conversation and correspondence abounding in ideas. It&nbsp;is stated by his friend Dr Hosack of New York, that Rush&nbsp;was successively a Quaker, an Anabaptist, a Presbyterian,&nbsp;and an Anglican. He gained great credit when the&nbsp;yellow fever devastated Philadelphia, in 1793, by his&nbsp;assiduity in visiting the sick (as many as one hundred and&nbsp;twenty in a day), and by his bold and apparently successful treatment of the disease by bloodletting. When he&nbsp;began to prosper in practice, he gave a seventh part of&nbsp;his income in charity. He died in 1813, after a five days’&nbsp;illness from typhus fever. Nine out of a family of thirteen&nbsp;children survived him, all prosperously settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rush’s writings cover an immense range of subjects, including language, the study of Latin and Greek, the moral faculty,&nbsp;capital punishment, medicine among the American Indians,&nbsp;maple sugar, the blackness of the negro, the cause of animal life,&nbsp;tobacco smoking, spirit drinking, as well as a long list of more&nbsp;strictly professional topics. His last work was an elaborate treatise&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diseases of the Mind</span><span class="font1"> (1812). He is best known now by the&nbsp;five volumes of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Inquiries and Observations,</span><span class="font1"> which he&nbsp;brought out at intervals from 1789 to 1798 (two later editions&nbsp;revised by the author). Epidemiology, and yellow fever in particular, was the subject on which he wrote to most purpose. His&nbsp;treatment of yellow fever by bloodletting helped more than anything else to make him famous, although the practice would now&nbsp;be condemned. His views as to the origin and diffusion of yellow&nbsp;fever have a more permanent interest. He stoutly maintained, as&nbsp;against the doctrine of importation from the West Indies, that the&nbsp;yellow fever of Philadelphia was generated on the spot by noxious&nbsp;exhalations, although he does not appear to have suspected that&nbsp;there was something special or specific in the filthy conditions of&nbsp;soil or harbour mud which gave rise to the miasmata. For a&nbsp;number of years he expressed the opinion that yellow fever might&nbsp;become catching from person to person, under certain aggravated&nbsp;circumstances ; but in the end he professed the doctrine of absolute&nbsp;non-contagiousness. He became well known in Europe as an&nbsp;authority on the epidemics of fever, and was elected an honorary&nbsp;member of several foreign societies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUSHWORTH, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 1607—1690), the compiler of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Collections</span><span class="font2"> Commonlydescribed by his name,&nbsp;was born in Northumberland about the year 1607. After&nbsp;a period of study at Oxford, but not, it appears, as a&nbsp;member of the university, he came to London, was entered&nbsp;at Lincoln’s Inn, and was in due course called to the bar.&nbsp;As early as 1630 he seems to have commenced attendance&nbsp;at the courts, especially the Star Chamber and the&nbsp;Exchequer Chamber, not for the purpose of practising his&nbsp;profession, but in order that he might observe and record&nbsp;the more remarkable of their proceedings. On the meeting&nbsp;of the Long Parliament in 1640 Lewasappointedassistant&nbsp;clerk to the House of Commons, and was in the habit of I&nbsp;making short-hand notes of the speeches he heard delivered in debate. He himself states that it was from&nbsp;his report that the words used by Charles I. during his&nbsp;memorable attempt to seize the “five members” were printed&nbsp;for public distribution under the king’s orders. Being an&nbsp;expert horseman, it seems that Rushworth was frequently&nbsp;employed by the House as their messenger as well as in&nbsp;the capacity of clerk. When the king left London, and&nbsp;while the earl of Essex was general, he was often the&nbsp;bearer of communications from the parliament to one or the&nbsp;other of them. In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax, to whom he&nbsp;was distantly related, and who was then in command of&nbsp;the Parliamentary forces, made him his secretary, and he&nbsp;remained with the army almost continuously until 1650.&nbsp;In 1649 he was at Oxford, and the degree of master of&nbsp;arts was conferred on him by the university. In 1652 he&nbsp;was nominated one of the commissioners for the reform of&nbsp;the common law, and in 1658 he was elected member for&nbsp;Berwick in the parliament of the commonwealth. Almost&nbsp;immediately before the Restoration he published the first&nbsp;volume of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Collections,</span><span class="font2"> which had been submitted in manuscript to Oliver Cromwell, with a very&nbsp;laudatory dedication to Richard Cromwell, then Lord&nbsp;Protector. But the turn of events induced him to withdraw this dedication, and he subsequently endeavoured&nbsp;without success to conciliate Charles II. by presenting him&nbsp;with some of the registers of the privy council which had&nbsp;come into his possession. In the convention of 1660,&nbsp;which recalled the king, he sat again as member for&nbsp;Berwick. In 1677 he was made secretary to Sir Orlando&nbsp;Bridgeman, then lord keeper, and he was returned for&nbsp;Berwick a third and a fourth time to the parliaments of&nbsp;1679 and 1681. Soon after this he appears to have fallen&nbsp;into straitened circumstances. In 1684 he was arrested&nbsp;for debt, and cast into the King’s Bench prison, where he&nbsp;died, after lingering for some time in a condition of mental&nbsp;infirmity, the result of excessive drinking, in 1690.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rushworth’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Collections of Private Passages of Stats, IVeighty Matters in Law, and Remarkable Proceedings in Parliament</span><span class="font1"> was reprinted in eight folio volumes in 1721. The eighth&nbsp;volume of this edition is an account of the trial of the earl of&nbsp;Strafford, the other seven volumes being concerned with the&nbsp;miscellaneous transactions of the period from 1618 to 1648. Only&nbsp;the first three volumes and the trial of Strafford were originally&nbsp;published in Rushworth’s lifetime ; but the manuscript of the&nbsp;other volumes was left by him ready for the press. The extreme&nbsp;value of the work is well known to all inquirers into the history of&nbsp;the Civil War, and much of the information it contains is to be&nbsp;found nowhere else. Its impartiality, however, can hardly be&nbsp;seriously maintained, and hence it is necessary to consult it with&nbsp;some caution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUSSELL, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John Russell, Earl</span><span class="font2"> (1792-1878), a statesman who for nearly half a century faithfully represented the traditions of Whig politics, was the third son of&nbsp;John, sixth duke of Bedford, and was born in Hertford&nbsp;Street, Mayfair, London, 18th August 1792, one of the&nbsp;most terrible months in the apnals of the French Revolution. Whilst still a child he was sent to a private school&nbsp;at Sunbury, and for a short time he was at Westminster&nbsp;School. Long and severe illness led to his being placed, with&nbsp;many other young men sprung from Whig parents, with&nbsp;a private tutor at Woodnesborough in Kent. Following&nbsp;in the footsteps of Lord Henry Petty, Brougham, and&nbsp;Horner, he went to the university of Edinburgh, then the&nbsp;academic centre of Liberalism, and dwelt in the house of&nbsp;Prof. Playfair, whom he afterwards described as “one of&nbsp;the best and noblest, the most upright, the most benevolent, and the most liberal of all philosophers.” On&nbsp;leaving the university, he determined upon taking a foreign&nbsp;tour, and, as the greater part of Europe was overrun by&nbsp;French troops, he landed at Lisbon with the intention of&nbsp;exploring the countries of Portugal and Spain.
