<p><span class="font0">which had its cradle in Rome, was soon adopted throughout Italy. Vignola (1507-1573) had done his best to bind the&nbsp;art of building to strictly classic rules, but in spite&nbsp;of his efforts the degeneration made progress during&nbsp;his own lifetime andunder Carlo Maderna (1556-1639),&nbsp;and proceeded still more rapidly under Bernini (1598-1680).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The characteristics of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">barocco</span><span class="font0"> are the reckless abuse of curves and extravagantly broken lines, of contorted columns,&nbsp;twisted tympanums and highly exaggerated ornaments; yet&nbsp;we must confess that many monuments of this period of art&nbsp;exhibit such exuberant life, such contrasts of relief and shadow,&nbsp;and such a wonderful combination of variety and solidity as&nbsp;cannot fail to please the many, even now, by the magnificence&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">their general effect. In Rome, the numerous works of&nbsp;Bernini, Borromini, Maderna, Rainaldi, Salvi, Fuga, Longhi&nbsp;and others bear witness to the gifted activity of Italian&nbsp;architects during that period; if genius necessarily creates,&nbsp;those men showed more of it than their predecessors who&nbsp;adhered to the classic and revered the teachings of Vitruvius.&nbsp;Degeneration is tolerated and sometimes even pleases, under&nbsp;the name of transformation, but there is nothing to be said&nbsp;for the real decay which marks the 18th century. It was not&nbsp;universal at first, for it is by nature a slow process; such men&nbsp;as A. Galilei, Specchi, Peparelli, Marchionni, Morelli, Camporese&nbsp;and Piranesi left works not altogether without value; but&nbsp;the outrageous abuse of ornament increased with every year,&nbsp;and was made more and more evident by the clumsy heaviness&nbsp;of the pillars and pilasters that supported the whole. The&nbsp;refined purity of the Renaissance disappeared as completely&nbsp;as the delicate grace and exquisite ornamentation of the&nbsp;Cosmatesque period. Many works of the greatest beauty were&nbsp;destroyed outright, and many more were disfigured and often&nbsp;wholly hidden by horrible stucco constructions and decorations;&nbsp;or, on a larger scale, by the application of hideous stone&nbsp;façades to churches of which the simple good taste had delighted&nbsp;generations of mankind. The deformation of the noble old&nbsp;Lateran basilica is a conspicuous instance of such deeds; another&nbsp;is Santa Maria Maggiore, and the false fronts plastered upon&nbsp;San Marcello and Santa Maria in Via Lata, both in the Corso,&nbsp;give a very clear idea of what was generally done. The interiors&nbsp;of old churches suffered quite as much, and even the frescoes&nbsp;of early masters were not spared; those by Pinturicchio in&nbsp;the third chapel (south) of S. Maria del Popolo were covered&nbsp;with wretched stucco ornaments, only removed in 1850, and&nbsp;numberless works of art by Giotto and other early painters&nbsp;were wilfully destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The decline of architecture continued in the 19th century, notwithstanding the laudable efforts of Valadier and a few&nbsp;other painstaking imitators, who produced the so-called&nbsp;“ academic neo-classic” reaction; among them may be noted&nbsp;the names of Canina, Poletti, Sarti and Azzurri. The futility&nbsp;of their works invited the feeble eclecticism which soon afterwards became so general that the architecture of the period&nbsp;is wholly without individuality, good • or bad. The chief&nbsp;architectural work of the 19th century was the rebuilding of&nbsp;the great basilica of S. Paolo fuori le Mura, burnt in 1823, in a&nbsp;style of cold splendour which is anything but devotional in&nbsp;its general effect. The pillars are huge monoliths of grey&nbsp;granite from the Alps; the confessio and transepts are lined&nbsp;with rosso and verde antico from quarries then recently rediscovered in Greece, and with Egyptian alabaster and lapis&nbsp;lazuli and malachite adorn the bases of the columns round&nbsp;the high altar in lavish profusion. Thirty years were required&nbsp;for the rebuilding of the frigidly magnificent edifice, which&nbsp;was reconsecrated in 1854. The east façade displays a quantity&nbsp;of gaudy mosaics, and the projected quadriportico is wanting.&nbsp;The belfry is nothing but a steeple, and has an unfortunate&nbsp;resemblance to a lighthouse. In extenuation of the result it&nbsp;must be admitted that the original building had been totally&nbsp;destroyed by fire, but no such excuse can be found for the&nbsp;barbarous assault on Christian art which was perpetrated by&nbsp;Francesco Vespignani in the extension of the Lateran basilica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This work was begun under Pius IX. and finished under Leo XIII.; it involved the destruction of the ancient tribune&nbsp;and its ambulatory, the only parts of the church which had&nbsp;so far escaped complete disfigurement, and the priceless&nbsp;mosaics (1290), among the most beautiful in Rome, were taken&nbsp;down and replaced in the new apse in a sadly mutilated and&nbsp;restored form. (For the interesting discoveries made in&nbsp;excavating for the new foundations, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann. 1st.</span><span class="font0"> 1877»P-332.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Vatican contains the largest collection in the world of Greco-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roman and Roman sculpture, with a few specimens of true Hellenic art. It is also very rich in Greek vases and in objects&nbsp;from Etruscan tombs; this latter division is called the&nbsp;Musco Gregoriano. There is also an Egyptian museum&nbsp;which contains a few important curiosities. In the great&nbsp;library arc preserved a number of early glass chalices and other&nbsp;rare objects from the catacombs, as well as many fine specimens of later Christian art—church plate and jewels. The picture&nbsp;gallery, though not as large as some of the private collections in&nbsp;Rome, contains few inferior pictures. The Lateran palace, still,&nbsp;like the Vatican, in the possession of the pope, contains a fine&nbsp;collection of classical sculpture, but is most remarkable as a museum&nbsp;of Christian antiquities. The two capitoline museums are very&nbsp;rich in classical sculpture, bronzes, coins, pottery and the contents&nbsp;of early Etruscan and Latin tombs. A large hall has been added,&nbsp;and is filled with sculptures found in Rome since 1870, of which the&nbsp;arrangement was completed on the occasion of King Edward VII.’s&nbsp;visit. The picture gallery contains a few masterpieces and a large&nbsp;number of inferior works. The new Museo delle Terme has been&nbsp;formed in the great cloister of S. Maria degli Angelí, to hold the&nbsp;numerous fine examples of classical, painting and sculpture found&nbsp;along the Tiber during the excavations for the new embankment,&nbsp;and in other places in Rome. The university of Rome possesses&nbsp;fine collections of minerals, fossils and other geological specimens,&nbsp;and examples of ancient marbles used in the buildings of Rome.&nbsp;A Museo Artístico Industríale has been formed in a monastery in&nbsp;the Capo le Case, to contain medieval works of art. It is, however,&nbsp;a matter for regret that the few medieval works which Rome&nbsp;possesses should be scattered in three small collections, namely, the&nbsp;one last mentioned, the Capitol and the Castle of S. Angelo, where an&nbsp;attempt is being made to form a real medieval museum; many&nbsp;objects, too, are dispersed throughout the city, and will doubtless&nbsp;disappear unless they are better protected. . The Museo Kircheriano&nbsp;contains an unrivalled collection of prehistoric objects of stone,&nbsp;bronze, iron and pottery, found in Italy and the Italian islands, and&nbsp;more particularly a number of ancient Latian urns, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capanne</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;like. The collection of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aes grave</span><span class="font0"> is the finest yet made; and the&nbsp;museum, also contains a large quantity of interesting classical&nbsp;antiquities of various kinds. Another branch is the Ethnological&nbsp;Museum. Unfortunately all these museums are badly adapted for&nbsp;purposes of study, being neither well arranged nor well catalogued.&nbsp;The Musco Baraccó, presented to the city in 1905 by the senator&nbsp;of that name, contains some ancient sculptures of great value. The&nbsp;Museum of Etruscan and Faliscan antiquities in the Villa Giulia,&nbsp;near Porta del Popolo, is of considerable importance, as is also the&nbsp;Borgia Museum in the Propaganda palace, the latter for its ancient&nbsp;geographical curiosities.. The museum of plaster casts in the&nbsp;Tcstaccio quarter contains reproductions of the principal ancient&nbsp;sculptures possessed by foreign museums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">. Among the private collections of pictures the Borghcse is unrivalled. The next in importance is that in the Doria palace, which, however, like most Italian collections, contains a&nbsp;large proportion of very inferior works. The Corsini&nbsp;picture gallery, bought by the government, is chiefly&nbsp;rich in tne works of the Bolognese and other third-rate&nbsp;painters, but also possesses a fine collection of engravings and&nbsp;etchings. There are a few fine paintings in the Barberini palace,&nbsp;but the Sciarra gallery no longer exists. There are some good&nbsp;pictures by Raphael and Guido Reni in the Academy of St Luke;&nbsp;the Galleria d’Arte Moderna is a collection of modern paintings&nbsp;acquired by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The. largest private collection of sculpture is that of the Villa</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Albani, which, among a large mass of inferior Roman sculpture, contains a few gems of Greek art. The original Albani collection&nbsp;was stolen and brought to Paris by Napoleon I., and was there&nbsp;dispersed; one relief, the celebrated Antinous, is the only piece of&nbsp;sculpture from the original collection which was sent back from&nbsp;Paris. This is in the collection of Prince Torlonia, which contains&nbsp;several.very fine works, but unfortunately the greater number are&nbsp;much injured and falsified by restorations. The casino in the&nbsp;Borghcse gardens possesses a great quantity of sculpture, mostly&nbsp;third-rate Roman works, the most important of which, however,&nbsp;are executed in precious marbles. The small collection which&nbsp;formerly existed in the Villa Ludovici has been bought by . the&nbsp;government and removed to the Museo delle Tcrmc; it contained&nbsp;a few works of Greek sculpture of great value, the most important&nbsp;being the Pergamean group representing the suicide of a Gaulish&nbsp;chief, a Medusa’s head in relief and a male terminal figure.
