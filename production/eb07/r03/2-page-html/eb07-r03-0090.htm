<p><span class="font0">Baltic Sea. Thus, then, there is an easy transport of goods insured from the remotest governments of the empire to&nbsp; the Caspian Sea, and thence to the Transcaucasian territory.&nbsp;There is also on the other side a communication by the&nbsp;Black Sea, but it does not present so many advantages as&nbsp;that by the Caspian. Our space, however, will not allow&nbsp;us to pursue the subject further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Islands in the Polar and Eastern Oceans.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Polar Ocean are the groups of New Siberia and of the Bear’s Island. The first consists of four large and&nbsp;many smaller islands. They are covered with snow during&nbsp;the greater part of the year ; their surface is generally&nbsp;rocky, and on some of them there are marks of volcanoes.&nbsp;They are chiefly remarkable for the bones and teeth of the&nbsp;mammoth, rhinoceros, buffalo, and other animals, which are&nbsp;found upon and beneath the surface of the ground. It was&nbsp;the search for this ivory which originally induced the Russians to visit these islands ; and their first expedition for&nbsp;exploring them was equipped in 1820. These islands do not&nbsp;appear to be inhabited, though traces of human beings have&nbsp;been occasionally discovered by the Russians engaged in&nbsp;the fisheries. The Bear’s Island group consists of six small&nbsp;islands, with several kinds of plants and shrubs on them, but&nbsp;no trees, although their shores are found to be covered with&nbsp;large drift-wood. The southernmost point of these islands&nbsp;is in latitude 69° 5', and they extend to latitude 76° 20'.&nbsp;Their longitude is between 154° and 183° 50' east from&nbsp;Greenwich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Eastern Ocean the islands are thus classed :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1 st,</span><span class="font0"> The islands of Gevosbewy and Nelken, in Behring’s Straits, in latitude 65° 4', with about 400 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2d,</span><span class="font0"> St Lawrence, latitude 63° 40<sup>z</sup>, and longitude 190° 26', and three smaller islands on the south-east of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3d,</span><span class="font0"> St Mathew’s, in latitude 60°, in the Sea of Kamts-chatka, consisting of three islands, one of which was named by some early British navigators Pinnacle Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4th</span><span class="font0">, The Prebelow Islands, in latitude 57°. Two of them have been named St Paul and St George. The former is&nbsp;about twenty-eight miles long and twenty broad, and both&nbsp;are well stocked with animals whose furs are valuable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5th,</span><span class="font0"> The Aleutian Islands. This is a chain of islands extending from the peninsula of Kamtschatka to the American peninsula of Alaschka, between 51° and 55° 10' north&nbsp;latitude, and 167° and 197° east longitude. (See Aleutian&nbsp;Islands.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6tlι,</span><span class="font0"> The Kurile Islands. This chain extends from north latitude43<sup>0</sup> 48' to 50<sup>o</sup>56', and from longitude 145° 5'to 156°&nbsp;30' east. They are evidently of volcanic origin. In some&nbsp;of them good water is found, but others arc utterly destitute of it. The few inhabitants are of Japanese origin.&nbsp;Many of these islands have hitherto obtained no European&nbsp;names ; but nineteen of the most considerable have been&nbsp;named by the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">American Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russian America comprehends the north-west angle of the North American continent, as far as the 141st degree of&nbsp;longitude west from London, with a narrow stripe of coast&nbsp;reaching as far south as 55½° of north latitude. It occupies a surface of about 500,000 square miles, of which the&nbsp;useful soil forms but a very small proportion. Thick fogs&nbsp;continually brood over these shores. Some parts of the&nbsp;country, bristling with mountains of difficult access, present at every step impenetrable forests and extensive morasses ; others, wholly without vegetation, offer to the eye&nbsp;nothing but sterile rocks. In short, the nature of the&nbsp;climate, and that of the soil itself, equally oppose prodigious obstacles to agriculture. The Russians have therefore been obliged to imitate the aborigines, in renouncing&nbsp;all attempts to form permanent establishments in the interior, and in fixing their abode upon the borders of the&nbsp;sea ; it being there only that the chase, fishing, and trade,&nbsp;could furnish them with the means of subsistence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russians who inhabit this remote part of the empire consist either of officers in the imperial navy or civil </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">employés,</span><span class="font0"> who again quit these shores after a service of five&nbsp;years ; or else of mechanics and workmen sent by the American Company. These latter, whose engagement is for&nbsp;seven years, also return home upon that term having expired ; and even during the time of their sojourn in the colonies their names still remain upon the registers of their&nbsp;district, and the class to which they originally belonged.&nbsp;Exempted only from the conscription, they still continue&nbsp;to pay taxes ; in short, the place of their birth is still regarded as their legal abode. The aborigines of the continent, with the exception of three tribes, are exempted&nbsp;from taxes ; but they show a great reluctance to come under&nbsp;the restraints of civilization. On several of the numerous&nbsp;islands, as well as along the shores of the mainland, the&nbsp;Russian Company have hunting and fishing stations. The&nbsp;otter chase is the chief occupation in summer, together with&nbsp;the pursuit of aquatic birds and sea-calves. In winter, snares&nbsp;are laid for the white foxes ; and dogs regularly trained for&nbsp;the purpose track the zizel to its subterranean abodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Novo Arkhangelsk or New Archangel, situated in latitude 57° 3' and longitude 135° 20', is the head establishment. It has a fortress with a small garrison and forty pieces of cannon. Hospitals and schools are established at&nbsp;the company’s expense, which also takes upon itself the&nbsp;maintenance of the orphans and children of those among&nbsp;the tribes whose family is numerous. In these schools the&nbsp;children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and the&nbsp;precepts of religion. The priests attached to the churches&nbsp;of these colonies occasionally traverse the remotest regions,&nbsp;for the purpose of making converts ; but, as may well be&nbsp;believed, their success is not in proportion to their zeal.&nbsp;On the 1st of January 1836 there were in American Russia 711 Russians, 1110 Creoles, 9101 Aleutians, and 99&nbsp;Kuriles, being 11,021 inhabitants in the various settlements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSSOOA, a village of Thibet, on the northern face of the Himalaya Mountains, which marks the frontier of the&nbsp;Nepaul dominions in this direction. Long. 85. 40. E. Lat.&nbsp;28. 3. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSOOLPOOR, a town of Hindustan, belonging to the nabob of Oude, in the province of Allahabad, forty miles&nbsp;north-west from the city and fortress of Allahabad. Long.&nbsp;81. 25. E. Lat. 25. 57. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUST, the calx or oxide of a metal, iron, for instance, formed by exposure to the air, or by corroding and dissolving its superficial parts by some menstruum. Water is&nbsp;the great instrument or agent in producing rust ; and hence&nbsp;oils and other fatty bodies secure metals from rust, water&nbsp;being no menstruum for oil, and therefore not able to make&nbsp;its way through it. Almost all metals are liable to rust.&nbsp;The rust of iron is not merely an oxide of that metal ;&nbsp;it contains, besides, a portion of carbonate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSTIC, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Architecture,</span><span class="font0"> implies a manner of building in imitation of nature, rather than according to the rules of&nbsp;art.</span></p>
