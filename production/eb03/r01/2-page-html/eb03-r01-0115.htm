<p><span class="font2">common earth-worms are of this kind. Some of theſe worms have been divided into two, others into three or&nbsp;four pieces ; and ſome oſ theſe pieces, after having paſ-ied two or three months without any appearance of life&nbsp;or motion, have then begun to reproduce a head or tail&nbsp;or both. The reproduction of the anus, alter ſuch a&nbsp;flate of reſt, is no long work ; a few days do it : but it&nbsp;is otherwiſe with the head, that does not ſeem to per-form its functions in the divided pieces till about ſeven&nbsp;months after the ſeparation. ' It is to be obſerved, that&nbsp;in all theſe operations both on earth and water-worms,&nbsp;the hinder part ſuffers greatly more than the fore&nbsp;part in the cutting ; for it always twills itſelf about </span><span class="font0">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">long time, as iſ actuated by ſtrong convulſions ; whereas the head uſually crawls away without the appearance of any great uneaſineſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reproduction of ſeveral parts of lobſters, crabs, &amp;c. makes alſo one of the great curioſities in natural&nbsp;hiſtory. That, in lieu of an organical part of an animal broken off, another ſhall rife perfectly like it, may&nbsp;ſeem inconſiſtent with the modern ſyſtem of generation,&nbsp;where the animal is ſuppoſed to be wholly formed in&nbsp;the egg. Yet has the matter of fact been well atteſted&nbsp;by the fiſhermen, and even by ſeveral virtuoſos who have&nbsp;taken the point into examination, particularly M. de&nbsp;Reaumur and M. Perrault, whoſe ſkill and exactneſs in&nbsp;things of this nature will hardly be queſtioned. The&nbsp;legs of lobſters, &amp;c. conſiſt each of five articulations :&nbsp;now, when any of the legs happen to break by any accident, as in walking, &amp;c. which frequently happens,&nbsp;the fracture is always found to be in a part near the&nbsp;fourth articulation ; and what they thus loſe is preciſe-ly reproduced ſome time afterwards ; that is, a part&nbsp;of a leg ſhoots out, confiſting of four articulations, the&nbsp;firſt whereof has two claws as before ; ſo that the loſs&nbsp;is entirely repaired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a lobſter’s leg be broken off by defign at the fourth or fifth articulation, what is thus broken off always&nbsp;comes again ; but it is not ſo if the fracture be made&nbsp;in the fiiſt, ſecond, or third articulation. In thoſe cafes,&nbsp;the reproduction is very rare if things continue as they&nbsp;are. But what is exceedingly ſurpriſing is, that they&nbsp;do not ; for, upon vifiting the lobſter maimed in theſe&nbsp;barren and unhappy articulations, at the end of two or&nbsp;three days, all the other articulations are found broken&nbsp;off to the fourth ; and it is ſuſpected they have performed the operation on themſelves, to make the réproduction of a leg certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The part reproduced is not only perfectly like that retrenched, but alſo, in a certain fpace of time, grows&nbsp;equal to it. Hence it is that we frequently ſee lobſters, which have their two big legs unequal, and that&nbsp;in all proportions. This ſhows the ſmaller leg to be a&nbsp;new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A part thus reproduced being broken, there is a ſe-cond reproduction. The ſummer, which is the only fεafon of the year when the lobſters eat, is the moſt&nbsp;favourable time for the reproduction. It is then performed in four or five weeks; whereas it takes up eight&nbsp;or nine months in any other ſeaſon. The ſmall legs are&nbsp;ſometimes reproduced, but more rarely, as well as more&nbsp;ſlowly, than the great ones : the horns do the ſame.&nbsp;The experiment is moſt eafily tried on the common&nbsp;crab. See Metaphysics, p.574. note (f) ; and Physiology, n<sup>lj</sup> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">261.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPTILL∂, in natural hiſtory, a kind of animals denominated from their creeping or advancing on the&nbsp;belly. Ογ reptiles are a genus of animals and infects,&nbsp;which, inſtead of feet, reſt on one part of the body,&nbsp;while they advance forward with the reſt. Such aie&nbsp;earthworms, ſnakes, caterpillars, &amp;c. Indeed, moſt of&nbsp;the claſs of reptiles have feet ; only thoſe very ſmall,&nbsp;and the legs remarkably ſhort in , proportion to the&nbsp;bulk of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Natuiahſts obierve a world of artful contrivance for the motion of reptiles. Thus, particularly in the earth,&nbsp;woιm, Dr W ιllιs tells us, the whole body is only a chain&nbsp;of annular muſcles ; or, as Dr Derham ſays, it is only&nbsp;one continued ſpiral muſcle, the orbicular fibres where-ot being contracted, render each ring narrower and&nbsp;longer than before ; by which means it is enabled, like&nbsp;the worm of an augre, to bore its paffage into the&nbsp;earth. Its reptile motion might alſo be explained by&nbsp;a wire wound on a cylinder, which when Hipped off,&nbsp;and one end extended and held faſt, will bring the&nbsp;other near to it. So the earthworm having ſhot out&nbsp;or extended his body (which is with a wreathing),&nbsp;it takes hold by thele ſmall feet it hath, and ſo con-tιaCtS the hinder part of its body. Dr Tyſon adds,&nbsp;that when the forepart of the body is itretched out,&nbsp;and applied to a plane at a diſtance, the hind part&nbsp;relaxing and ſhortening is eafily drawn towards it as a&nbsp;centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Its feet are difpofed in a quadruple row the whole length of the worm, with which, as with ſo many hooks,&nbsp;it ſaſtens down fometimes this and ſometimes that part&nbsp;of the body to the plane, and at the ſame time ſtretch-es out or drags after it another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The creeping of ſerpents is effected after a fomewhat different manner ; there being a difference in their&nbsp;ſtructure, in that theſe laſt have a campages of bones&nbsp;•articulated together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I he body here is not drawn together, but as it were complicated ; part of it being applied on the rough&nbsp;ground, and the reſt ejaculated and ſhot from it, which&nbsp;being.ſet on the ground in its turn, brings the other&nbsp;after it. I he ſpine of the back variouſly wreathed has&nbsp;the. ſame effect in leaping, as the joints in the feet of&nbsp;other animals they make their leaps by means of&nbsp;muſcles, and extend the plicae or folds.
