(John), an excellent German hiſtorian, born of obſcure parents, in 1506, at Sleidan, a ſmall town on the confines of the duchy of Juliers. After ſtudying ſome time in his own country, together with his townſman the Earned John Sturmius, he went to France, and in 1535 entered into the ſervice of the cardinal and archbiſhop John du Bellay. He retired to Straſburg in 1542, where he acquired the eſteem and friendſhip of the moſt conſiderable perſons, particularly of James Sturmius ; by whoſe advice and assiſtance he was enabled to write the hiſtory of his own time. He was employed in ſome public negociations ; but the death of his wife, in 1555, plunged him into ſo deep a melancholy, that he lost his memory entirely, and died the year following. In 1555 came out, in folio, <hi rend="italic">De statu Religionis et Reipublicœ sub Carola Quintο, &amp; c.</hi> in 25 books ; from the year 1517, when Luther began to preach, to the year of its publication; which hiſtory was preſently tranſiated into moſt of the languages of Europe. Beſides this great work, he wrote, <hi rend="italic">De quatitur ſummis Imperiis, libri tres ;</hi> with ſome other hiſtorical and political pieces.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
