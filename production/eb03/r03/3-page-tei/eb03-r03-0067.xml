The excellent analyſes which we meet with of ſome ſentiments, and the delicate anatomy which he makes of ſome actions, are not ſuſſicient to counterbalance the deteftable matter which is found in them, and the unceaſing obloquies everywhere to be met with.” It is certain, that if Rouſſeau has given a faithful delineation of ſome perſons, he has viewed others through a cloud, which formed in his mind perpetual ſuſpſeions. He imagined he thought juſtly and ſpoke truly ; but the ſimpleſt thing in nature, ſays M. Serv mt, if diſtilled throu⅛ his violent and ſuſpſeious head, might becom poiſom Rouſſeau, in what he fays of himſelf, makes ſuch acknowledgments as certainly prove that there were better men than he, at leaſt if we may judge him from the ſirſt ſix books of his memoirs, where nothing appears but his vices. They ought not perhaps to be ſeparated from the ſix laſt books, where he ſptaks of the virtues which make reparation ſor them ; or rather the work ought not to have been publiſhed at all, iſ it be truc (which there can be little doubt of) that in his conſeſ-ſions hς injured the public manners, both by the baſe-neſs of the vices be diſcloſed, and by the manner in which he united them ith the virtues. The other pieces which we find in this new edition oſ his works are, I. <hi rend="italic">The Reveries oſ a Solitary ÏV .ndeιer,</hi>  being a journal of the latter part of his life. In this he confeſſes, that he liked better to ſend his children into hofpitals deſtined ſor orphans, than to take upon himſelf the charge of their maintenance and education ; and endeavours to palliate this error, which nothing can exculpate. 2. <hi rend="italic">Cοηfιderations upon the Government oſ Poland.</hi>  3. <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of l ord Ed ∙tυ rd,</hi>  a novel, being a kind of ſupplement to the new Heloiſa. 4· <hi rend="italic">Famous Memoirs and Eugitive Pieces,</hi>  with a great number of letters, ſome of which are very long, and written with too much ſtudy, but containing ſome eloquent paſſages and ſome deep thought. 5. <hi rend="italic">Emilia and Sophia.</hi>  6. <hi rend="italic">The Levite of Ephraim,</hi>  a poem in proſe, in 4 cantos ; written in a truly ancient ſtyle oſ ſimplicity. 7. <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic">Mers to Sara.</hi>  8. <hi rend="italic">An Opera and a Comedy. </hi>9. <hi rend="italic">Tranβations of thefrfl book oſ Tacitus’s Hiβory, oſ the Epiſode of Olinda and Sophrοnia, taken from Taff), </hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. Like all the other writings of Rouſſeau, we find in theſe poſthumous pieces many admirable and ſome uſeful things ; but they alſo abound with contradictions, paradoxes, and ideas very unfavourable to religion. In his letters eſpecially we ſee a man chagrined at misfortunes, which he never attributes to himſelf, ſuſpſeious of every body about him, calling and believing himſelf a lamb in the midſt of wohes ; in one word, as like Paſcal in the ſtrength of his genius, as in his fancy of always feeing a precipice about him. This is the reflection oſ M. Servant, who knew him, aſſiſted him, and careſſed him during his retreat at Grenoble in 768. This magiſtrate having been very attentive in obſerving his character, ought the rather to be believed, as he inſpected it without either malice, envy, or reſcntment, and only from the concern he had for this philoſopher. whom he loved and admired.</p><p>ROUT, in law, is applied to an aſſembly of perſons</p><p>going forcibly to commit (ome unlawful act, w.*ether they execute it or not. See Riot.</p><p>ROUTE, a public road, highway, or courſe, eſpecially that which military forces take. 'Γhis word is alſo uſed for the defeat and flight of an army.</p><p>ROWE (Nicholas), deſcended of an ancient family in Devoriſhire, was born in 1673- He acquired a complete taſte of the claſſic authors under the fa r.ous Dr Buſhy in Weſtminſter ſchool; but poetry wao his early and darling ſtudy. His father, who was a lawyct, and de’ gned him for his own proſeſſion, entered him a ſtudent in the Middle Temple He made remarkable advances in the ſtudy of the law ; but the love of thc belles lettres, and of poetry in particular, ſtopt him in h’s career. His firſt tragedy, the Ambitious Stepmother, meeting with univerſal applauſe, he laid aſide all thoughts of riſing by the law. He afterward compoſed ſeveral tragedies ; but that which he valued himſelf moſt upon, was his Tame. lane. The others are, the <hi rend="italic">Fair Penitent Uiffs,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Royal Cοnv rt, Jane Shore,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Lady J .r&gt;e G' eν.</hi>  He alſo wrote a poem called the <hi rend="italic">Piter, </hi>and ſeveral poems upon different ſubjects, which have been publiſhed under the title of Mifcellane0u3 Works, in one volume, as his dramatic works have been in two. Rowe is chiefly to be conſidered (Dr Johnſon ob-ſerves) in the light of a tragic writer and a tranſlator. In his attempt at comedy, he failed ſo ignominiouſly, that his Biter is not inſerted in his works ; and his oc-ca onal poems and ſhort compofitions are rarely worthy of either praiſe or cenſure, for they ſeem the ca-ſual ſports of a mind ſeek ng rather to amuſe its leiſure $han to exerciſe its powers. In the conſtruction of his dramas there is not much art ; he is not a nice obſerver of the unities. He extends time, and varies place, as his convenience requires. To vary the place is not (in the opinion oſ the learned critic from whom theſe ob-ſervations are borrowed) any violation of nature, if the change be made between the acts ; for it is no leſs eaſy for the ſpectator to ſuppoſe himſelf at Athens in the ſecond act, than at Thebes in the ſirſt ; but to change the ſcent, as is done by Rowe in the middle of an act, is to add more acts to the play, lmce an act is ſo much of the bufineſs as is tranſacted without interruption. Rowe, by this licence, eaſily extricates him-ſelt from difficulties ; as in Lady Jane Gray, when we have been terrified with all the dreadful pomp of public execution, and are wondering how the heroine or the poet will proceed, no ſooner has Jane pronounced ſome prophetic rhimes, than—paſs and be gone—the ſcene cloſes, and Pembroke and Gardiner are ruined out upon the ſtage. I know not (ſays Dr Johnſon) that there can be found in his plays any deep ſearch into nature, any accurate diſcriminations of kindred qualities, or nice diſplay of paſſion in its progreſs ; all is general and undefined. Nor does he much intereſt or affect the auditor, except in Jane Shore, who is always ſeen and heard writh pity. Alicia is a character of empty noiſe, with no reſemblairce to real ſorrow or to natural madneſs. Whence then -has Rowe his reputation ? From the rea-ſonableneſs and propriety of ſome ot his ſcenes, from the elegance of his diction, and the ſuavity of his verſe. He ſeldom moves either pity or terror, but he often elevates the ſentiment; he ſeldom pierces the breaſt, but he always delights the ear, and often improves the</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
