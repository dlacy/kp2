<p><span class="font1">as are now made there is no injection of water during compression, and the compressed air is cooled in a surface cooler, not by actual&nbsp;mixture with a shower of cold water. Further, though the interchanger&nbsp; is still used by some makers, it has been found by experience&nbsp;that, with properly constructed valves and passages in the expansion&nbsp;cylinder, there is no trouble from the formation of snow, when, as&nbsp;is the general practice, the same air is used over and over again,&nbsp;the compressor taking its supply from the insulated room. So&nbsp;far as the air discharged from the expansion cylinder is concerned,&nbsp;its humidity is precisely the same so long as its temperature and&nbsp;pressure are the same, inasmuch as when discharged from the&nbsp;expansion cylinder it is always in a saturated condition for that&nbsp;temperature and pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ideal coefficient of performance is about 1, but the actual coefficient will be about after allowing for the losses incidental&nbsp;to working. In practice the air is compressed to about 50 lb per&nbsp;square inch above the atmosphere, its temperature rising to&nbsp;about 300° F. The compressed air then passes through coolers&nbsp;in which it is cooled to within about 5<sup>0</sup> of the initial temperature&nbsp;of the cooling water, and is deprived of a portion of its moisture,&nbsp;after which it is admitted into the expansion cylinder and&nbsp;expanded nearly to atmospheric pressure. The thermal equivalent&nbsp; of the power exerted on the piston is taken from the&nbsp;air, which, with cooling water at 60° F. and after allowing for&nbsp;friction and other losses, is discharged at a temperature of&nbsp;60° to 80° below zero F. according to the size of the machine.&nbsp;The pistons of the compression and expansion cylinders are&nbsp;connected to the same crankshaft, and the difference between the&nbsp;power expended in compression and that restored in expansion,&nbsp;plus the friction of the machine, is supplied by means of a steam&nbsp;engine coupled to the crankshaft, or by any other source of&nbsp;power. For marine purposes two complete machines are&nbsp;frequently mounted on one bed-plate and worked either together&nbsp;or separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some machines used in the United States the cold air is not discharged into the rooms but is worked in a closed cycle,&nbsp;the rooms being cooled by means of overhead pipes through&nbsp;which the cold expanded air passes on its way back to the&nbsp;compressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Liquid Machines.—</span><span class="font2">Machines of the second class may conveniently  be divided into three types: (a) Those in which there&nbsp;is no recovery of the refrigerating agent, water being the agent&nbsp;employed; they will be dealt with as “Vacuum machines.”&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2">) Those in which the agent is recovered by means of mechanical&nbsp; compression; they are termed “ Compression machines.”&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2">) Those in which the agent is recovered by means of absorption&nbsp;by a liquid; they are known as “ Absorption machines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the first class, since the refrigerating liquid is itself rejected, the only agent cheap enough to be employed is water. The&nbsp;boiling point of water varies with pressure; thus at&nbsp;one atmosphere or 14·7 lb per square inch it is 212° F.,&nbsp;whereas at a pressure of ·085 ℔ per square inch it is 32°,&nbsp;and at lower pressures there is a still further fall in temperature.&nbsp;This property is made use of in vacuum machines. Water at&nbsp;ordinary temperature, say 60°, is placed in an air-tight glass or&nbsp;insulated vessel, and when the pressure is reduced by means of&nbsp;a vacuum pump it begins to boil, the heat necessary for evaporation&nbsp; being taken from the water itself. The pressure being&nbsp;still further reduced, the temperature is gradually lowered until&nbsp;the freezing-point is reached and ice formed, when about one-sixth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of the original volume has been evaporated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earliest machine of this kind appears to have been made in 1755 by Dr. William Cullen, who produced the vacuum by means&nbsp;of a pump alone. In 1810 Sir John Leslie combined with the air&nbsp;pump </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">vessel containing strong sulphuric acid for absorbing the&nbsp;vapour from the air, and is said to have succeeded in producing&nbsp;1</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">to 1½ lb of ice in a single operation. E. C. Carré later adopted the&nbsp;same principle. In 1878 F. Windhausen patented a vacuum&nbsp;machine for producing ice in large quantities, and in 1881 one of&nbsp;these machines, said to be capable of making about 12 tons of ice&nbsp;per day, was put to work in London. The installation was fully&nbsp;described by Carl Pieper </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Trans. Soc. of Engineers,</span><span class="font1"> 1882, p. 145)&nbsp;and by Dr. John Hopkinson </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Journal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Soc. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arts,</span><span class="font1"> 1882, vol.&nbsp;xxxi. p. 20). The process, however, not being successful from a&nbsp;commercial point of view, was abandoned. At the present time&nbsp;vacuum machines are only employed for domestic purposes. The&nbsp;hand apparatus invented by H. A. Fleuss consists of a vacuum&nbsp;pump </span><span class="font2">capable </span><span class="font1">of reducing the air pressure </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font1">a fraction of a millimetre, the suction pipe of which is connected first with a vessel&nbsp;containing sulphuric acid, and second with the vessel containing&nbsp;the water to be frozen. Both these vessels are mounted on a rocking&nbsp;base, so that the acid can be thoroughly agitated while the machine&nbsp;is being worked. As soon as the pump has sufficiently exhausted&nbsp;the air from the vessel containing the water, vapour is rapidly&nbsp;given off and is absorbed by the acid until sufficient heat has been&nbsp;abstracted to bring about the desired reduction in temperature,&nbsp;the acid becoming heated by the absorption of water vapour,&nbsp;while the water freezes. The small Fleuss machine will produce&nbsp;about 1¼ ℔ of ice in one operation of 20 minutes. Iced water&nbsp;in a carafe for drinking purposes can be produced in about three&nbsp;minutes. The acid vessel holds 9 lb of acid, and nearly 3 lb of ice&nbsp;can be made for each 1 lb of acid before the acid has become too weak&nbsp;to do further duty. Another machine, which can be easily worked&nbsp;by a boy, will produce 20 to 30 lb of ice in one hour, and is perhaps&nbsp;the largest size practicable with this method of freezing. The&nbsp;temperature attainable depends on the strength and condition of&nbsp;the sulphuric acid; ordinarily it can be reduced to zero F., and&nbsp;temperatures 20° lower have frequently been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though prior to 1834 several suggestions had been made with regard to the production of ice and the cooling of liquids by the&nbsp;evaporation of a more volatile liquid than water, the&nbsp;first machine actually constructed and put to work&nbsp;was made by John Hague in that year from the designs&nbsp;of Jacob Perkins </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Journal of Soc. of Arts,</span><span class="font2"> 1882, vol. xxxi. p. 77).&nbsp;This machine, though never used commercially, is the parent&nbsp;of all modern compression machines. Perkins in his patent&nbsp;specification states that the volatile fluid is by preference ether.&nbsp;In 1856 and 1857 James Harrison of Geelong, Victoria, patented&nbsp;a machine embodying the same principle as that of Perkins, but&nbsp;worked out in a much more complete and practical manner. It&nbsp;is stated that these machines were first made in New South&nbsp;Wales in 1859, but the first Harrison machine adopted successfully for industrial purposes in England was applied in the year&nbsp;1861 for cooling oil in order to extract the paraffin. In Harrison’s&nbsp;machine the agent used was ether (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O. Improvements&nbsp;were made by Siebe &amp; Company of London, and a considerable&nbsp;number of ether machines both for ice-making and refrigerating&nbsp;purposes were supplied by that firm and others up to the year&nbsp;1880. In 1870 the subject of refrigeration was investigated by&nbsp;Professor Carl Linde of Munich, who was the first to consider&nbsp;the question from a thermodynamic point of view. He dealt&nbsp;with the coefficient of performance as a common basis of comparison for all machines, and showed that the compression&nbsp;vapour machine more nearly reached the theoretic maximum&nbsp;than any other </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Bayerisches Industrie und Gewerbeblatt,</span><span class="font2"> 1870 and&nbsp;1871). Linde also examined the physical properties of various&nbsp;liquids, and, after making trials with methylic ether in 1872,&nbsp;built his first ammonia compression machine in 1873. Since&nbsp;then the ammonia compression machine has been most widely&nbsp;adopted, though the carbonic acid machine, also compression,&nbsp;which was first made in 1880 from Linde’s designs, is now used&nbsp;to a considerable extent, especially on board ship.</span></p>
