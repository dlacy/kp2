(fab. hiſt. ), a celebrated river of hell, round which it flows nine times. The gods held the waters of the Styx in ſuch veneration, that to swear by them was reckoned an oath altogether inviolable. If any of the gods had perjured themselves, Jupiter obliged them to drink the waters of the Styx, which lulled them for one whole year into a ſenſeleſs ſtupidity, for the nine following years they were deprived of the ambroſia and the nectar of the gods, and after the expiration of the years of their puniſhment, they were reſtored to the aſſembly of the deities, and to all their original privileges. It is ſaid that this veneration was ſhown to the Styx, becauſe it received its name from the nymph Styx, who with her three daughters aſſiſted Jupiter in his war againſt the Titans.</p><p>Styx was a river which it was necessary for departed ſhades to paſs before they could enter the infernal regions ;<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Trans. of the R.

The ghoſts of thoſe who had not been honoured with the rites of ſepulture were obliged to wander an hundred years before Charon could admit them into his boat to convey them before the judges of Hades. What could have given rise to this fable of Charon and his boat, it is not very material to inquire. Mythological writers have ſaid, that the Greeks learned it from the Egyptians, which is indeed probable enough ; that the Egyptians framed both this, and ſome other fables relating to the dead, from certain cuſtoms peculiar to their country ; that in particular there was, not far from Memphis, a famous burying-place, to which the dead bodies were conveyed in a boat across the lake Acherusia ; and that Charon was a boatman who had long officiated in that ſervice. The learned Dr Blackwell ſays, in his life of Homer, that, in the old Egyptian language, <hi rend="italic">Charoni</hi> ſignified “ ferryman.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
