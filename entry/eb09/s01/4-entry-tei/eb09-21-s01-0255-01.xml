Three persons of this name once enjoyed considerable literary celebrity:â€”(1) Francisco Sanchez (Sanctius) (1523-1601), successively professor of Greek and of rhetoric at Salamanca, whose <hi rend="italic">Minerva,</hi> first printed at that town in 1587, was long the standard work on Latin grammar; (2) Francisco Sanchez, a Portuguese physician of Jewish parentage, professor of philosophy and physic at Toulouse, where he died at the age of seventy in 1632, whose ingenious but sophistical writings <hi rend="italic">(Quod nihil scitur,</hi> 1581) mark the high-water of reaction against the dogmatism of the traditional schools of his time; (3) Thomas Sanchez of Cordova (1551-1610), Jesuit and casuist, whose treatise <hi rend="italic">De Matrimonio</hi> (Genoa, 1592) is more notorious for its repulsive features than celebrated for its real learning and ability.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
