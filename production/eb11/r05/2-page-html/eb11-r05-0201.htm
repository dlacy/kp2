<p><span class="font0">of a small lake, a fort which received the name of Pereyaslav-Ryazanskiy. In 1294 (or in 1335) the bishop of Murom, compelled to leave his own town, settled in Pereyaslav-Ryazanskiy. The princes of Ryazan followed his example, and by and by&nbsp;completely abandoned the old republican town of Ryazan. In&nbsp;1300 a congress of Russian princes was held there, and in the&nbsp;following year the town was taken by the Moscow prince. It&nbsp;continued, however, to be the residence of the Ryazan princes&nbsp;until 1517. In 1365 and 1377 it was plundered and burned by&nbsp;the Tatars, but in 1460, 1513, 1521 and 1564 it was strong&nbsp;enough to repel them. Earthen walls with towers were erected&nbsp;after 1301; and in the 17th century a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">krernl</span><span class="font0"> or citadel still&nbsp;stood on the high crag above the Trubezh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYAZHSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Ryazan, 72 m. by rail S. of the city of Ryazan. Pop. (1897) 12,993. It&nbsp;is one of the chief railway junctions of Russia, where meet the&nbsp;lines from Moscow to S. Russia and Caucasia and from Poland&nbsp;to Samara and Siberia. It has become a centre for all the corngrowing regions of Russia, and is a wealthy place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYBINSK, or Ruibinsk, a town of Russia, in the government of Yaroslavl, 60 m. by river N.W. of Yaroslavl. It is connected by rail (186 m.) with Bologoye, on the line&nbsp;between St Petersburg and Moscow. It derives its importance from its situation on the Volga, opposite the mouth of&nbsp;the Sheksna, which connects the Volga with the regions around&nbsp;Lake Ladoga. Rybinsk has also an active trade in agricultural&nbsp;products from the neighbouring districts. The permanent&nbsp;population, which was 25,223 in 1897, is increased in the summer&nbsp;by nearly 100,000 workers from different parts of Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYDBERG, ABRAHAM VIKTOR (1828-1895), Swedish author and publicist, was born in Jönköping on 18th December&nbsp;1828. He was educated at the high school of Växiö, and passed&nbsp;on to the university of Lund in 1851. While at school he was&nbsp;publishing verse and prose in the periodicals; some of these&nbsp;early miscellanies he collected in 1894 in the volumes called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varia.</span><span class="font0"> As a student he turned to more precise labours, and&nbsp;devoted himself to science. He had almost determined to&nbsp;adopt the profession of an engineer, when he was offered in&nbsp;1855 <sup>a</sup> P°<sup>st on</sup> the staff of one of the largest Swedish newspapers. This caused his thoughts to return to imaginative&nbsp;literature, and it was in the feuilleton of this journal (the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Göteborgs Handels-och sjöfartstidning)</span><span class="font0"> that Viktor Rydberg’s&nbsp;romances successively appeared; he was editorially connected&nbsp;with it until 1876. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Freebooter on the Baltic</span><span class="font0"> (1857) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Last of the Athenians</span><span class="font0"> (1859) gave Rydberg a place in the front&nbsp;rank of contemporary novelists. It was a surprise to his&nbsp;admirers to see him presently turn to theology, but with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Bible's Teaching about Christ</span><span class="font0"> (1862), in which the aspects of&nbsp;modem Biblical criticism were first placed before Swedish&nbsp;readers, he enjoyed a vast success. He followed this up by&nbsp;a number of contributions to the popular philosophy of religion,&nbsp;all inspired by the same reverent and yet searching spirit of&nbsp;inquiry. The modernity of his views led to his being opposed&nbsp;by the orthodox clergy, but by the wider public he was greatly&nbsp;esteemed. Nevertheless, it is said that it was his religious&nbsp;criticism which so long excluded him from the Swedish Academy,&nbsp;since he was not elected until 1877, when he had long been&nbsp;the first living author of Sweden. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman Days</span><span class="font0"> is a series of&nbsp;archaeological essays on Italy (1876). He collected his poems&nbsp;in 1882; his version of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Faust</span><span class="font0"> dates from 1876. In 1884 he&nbsp;was appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at Stockholm.&nbsp;He died, after a short illness, on the 22nd of September 1895.&nbsp;In Viktor Rydberg Sweden possessed a writer of the first order,&nbsp;who carried on the tradition of Boström and Geijer in philosophy and history, and possessed in addition a glow of imagination and a marvellous charm of style. He was an idealist of&nbsp;the old romantic type which Sweden had known for three-quarters of a century; he was the last of that race, and perhaps,&nbsp;as a mere writer, the greatest. In personal character Rydberg&nbsp;was extremely like his writings—stately, ardent and ceremonious, with a fund of amiability which made him universally&nbsp;beloved. His premature death was the subject of national</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">mourning, and had even a historical significance, for with him the old romantic influence in Swedish literature ceased to be&nbsp;paramount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E. G.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYDE, a municipal borough and watering-place in the Isle of Wight, England, 5 m. S.S.W. of Portsmouth. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 11,043. It is beautifully situated on rising ground&nbsp;on the N.E. coast, overlooking Spithead. It occupies the site&nbsp;of a village called La Rye or La Riche, which was destroyed&nbsp;by the French in the reign of Edward II. About the close&nbsp;of the 18th century it was a small fishing hamlet, but it rapidly&nbsp;grew into favour as a watering-place. Ryde is connected by&nbsp;rail with the other towns in the island, and there is also steamboat communication with Portsmouth, Southampton, Southsea,&nbsp;Portsea and Stoke’s Bay. The pier, built originally in 1812,&nbsp;but since then greatly extended, forms a delightful promenade&nbsp;half a mile in length. The railway trains run out to its head,&nbsp;and an electric tramway also runs along it. The principal&nbsp;buildings are All Saints church, erected in 1870 from the designs&nbsp;of Sir Gilbert Scott, and other churches, the market house and&nbsp;town hall, the Royal Victoria Yacht club-house, the theatre and&nbsp;the Royal Isle of Wight Infirmary. There are golf-links near the&nbsp;town. The town was incorporated in 1868, and is governed by&nbsp;a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 819 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYDER, ALBERT PINKHAM (1847- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American artist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was born at New Bedford, Mass., on the 19th of March 1847. He was a pupil of William E. ilarshall and of the schools of the&nbsp;National Academy of Design. Among his better known paintings are: “Temple of the Mind,” “Jonah and the Whale,”&nbsp;“ Christ appearing unto Mary,” “ The Flying Dutchman,”&nbsp;“ Charity,” and “ The Little Maid of Arcadie.” He became&nbsp;a member of the Society of American Artists in 1878, and a&nbsp;National Academician in 1906.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYE, a market town and municipal borough in the Rye parliamentary division of Sussex, England, 11 m. N.E. by&nbsp;E. from Hastings, on the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 3900. It rises on a sharp eminence above the&nbsp;S. of Romney Marsh, which within historic times was an inlet&nbsp;of the English Channel. The sea began to recede in the 16th&nbsp;century, and now the river Rother forms a small estuary with&nbsp;its mouth 2 m. from the town; this serves as a small harbour&nbsp;with a depth of 15 ft. at high tide, and there is some trade in&nbsp;coal, grain and timber. Fishing and shipbuilding are carried&nbsp;on, and there is a market for sheep (which are pastured in&nbsp;great numbers on the marshes), wool, grain and hops. The&nbsp;church of St Mary is of mixed architecture, chiefly Transitional,&nbsp;Norman and Early English; it is cruciform, with a low central&nbsp;tower. Of the old fortifications there remain portions of the&nbsp;town wall, a strong quadrangular tower built by William of&nbsp;Ypres, earl of Kent, and lord warden in the time of Stephen,&nbsp;and now forming part of the police station, and a handsome&nbsp;gate with a round tow’er on each side, known as the Land Gate,&nbsp;at the entrance into Rye from the London road. Picturesque&nbsp;old houses are numerous. In the low land S. of the town stands&nbsp;Camber Castle, one of the coastal defensive works of Henry&nbsp;VIII. In the vicinity are golf-links, to which a steam tram&nbsp;runs from the town. The municipal borough is under a mayor,&nbsp;4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 985 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the time of Edward the Confessor, Rye (Ria, Ryerot, La Rie) was a fishing village and, as part of the manor of “ Rames-lie,” was granted by the king to the abbot and convent of&nbsp;Fecamp, by whom it was retained until Henry III. resumed it.&nbsp;By 1086 Rye was probably a port of consequence, and a charter&nbsp;of Richard I. shows that in the reign of Henry II., if not before,&nbsp;it had been added to the Cinque Ports. The fluctuations of the&nbsp;sea and attacks of the French caused its decline in the 13th and&nbsp;14th centuries, and the walls were therefore built in the reign&nbsp;of Edward III. The decay of Winchelsea contributed to the&nbsp;partial revival of Rye in the 15th and 16th centuries, when it&nbsp;was a chief port of passage. Towards the end of the 16th century&nbsp;the decay of the port began, and notwithstanding frequent&nbsp;attempts to improve the harbour it never recovered its ancient&nbsp;prosperity. Rye was incorporated under a mayor and jurats</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
