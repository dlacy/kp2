<p><label>RAPIER</label>
the name given to two distinct types of sword. Originally the “ rapier ” (Fr. <hi rend="italic">rapière</hi> ) was a long two-edged and pointed weapon with a wide cup hilt, used together with the dagger in fencing and duelling chiefly as a thrusting weapon, the cut taking a secondary position. This was the typical duelling sword of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century the “ small-sword ” took its place; this was a pointed weapon only, the “ cut ” having entirely dropped out, and the dagger being discarded. The word rapieris of doubtful origin. Du Cange ( <hi rend="italic">Glossarium, s.v.</hi> " Rapparia”) quotes an example of the word used as an adjective to qualify <hi rend="italic">espée</hi> as early as 1474, and gives as a conjectural derivation Gr. <hi rend="italic">ῥαπίξϵιν</hi> = Lat. <hi rend="italic">caedere,</hi> to cut. Skeat ( <hi rend="italic">Etym. Dict.,</hi> 1910) follows the suggestion of Diez that <hi rend="italic">rapière</hi> is from <hi rend="italic">raspière,</hi> a rasper or poker, and was a name given in contempt by the old cut-and-thrust fencers to the new weapon. Spanish has <hi rend="italic">raspadera,</hi> a raker, and there are several 16th and 17th century quotations alluding to the contempt with which the rapier was greeted, and to its Spanish origin (see Fencing and Sword).</p>
