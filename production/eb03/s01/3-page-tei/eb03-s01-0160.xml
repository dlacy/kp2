At Richmond he was again flopped by John’s ravages, and obliged to return, through Weſtmoreland to his own dominions.</p><p>When the Engliſh barons found it neceſſary to put themſelves under the protection of Louis, ſon to the king of France, that prince, among other acts of ſovereignty, ſummoned Alexander to do him homage; but the latter being then, engaged in the ſiege of Carliſle, which had fallen into the hands of King John, he could not immediately attend. In a ſhort time Alexander found himſelf obliged to abandon this enterpriſe: after which he laid ſiege to Barnard caſtle; but being baffled here alſo, marched ſouthwards through the whole kingdom of England, and met Louis at London or- Dover, where the prince confirmed to him the rights to Northumberland, Cumberland, and Weſtmoreland. He continued a faithful ally to Louis and the barons in their wars with John; and, in 1216, brought a freſh army to their aſſiſtance, when their affairs were almoſt deſperate. This once more turned the ſcale againſt John; but he ſoon after dying, the Engliſh eaſily became reconciled to the government of Henry III. and the party of Louis dwindled every day, till at laſt he was obliged to drop all thoughts of being king of England.</p><p>As long as Louis continued in England, Alexander proved faithful to his intereſt; but, in 1217,  he was on ſuch good terms with Henry as to demand his eldeſt ſiſter, the Princeſs Joan, for a wife. His requeſt was granted, and in 1221 he eſpouſed the princeſs; while his eldeſt ſiſter Margery was married to Hubert de Burgh juſticiary of England, and his ſecond ſiſter to Gilbert earl Marſhal, the two greateſt ſubjects in England.</p><p>As long as the queen of Scotland lived, a perfect harmony ſubſiſted between the Scots and Engliſh: but in 1239 Queen Joan died without children; and Alexander ſoon after married Mary, the daughter of Egeland de Coucy, a young and beautiful French lady, by whom he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> in 1241. From this time a coolneſs took place between the two courts, and many differences aroſe; but no hoſtilities were commenced on either ſide during the lifetime of Alexander, who died in 1249 in the 35th year of his reign.</p><p>Immediately after the death of his father, Alexander III. took poffeſſion of the throne. He is the firſt of the Scots kings of whoſe coronation we have any particular account. We are told, that the ceremony was performed by the biſhop of St Andrew’s, who girded the king with a military belt, probably as an emblem of his temporal juriſdiction. He then explained in Latin, and afterwards in Gaelic, the laws and oaths relating to the king; who agreed to and received them all with great appearance of joy, as he alſo did the benediction and ceremony of coronation from the ſame prelate. After the ceremony was performed, a Highlander, probably one of thoſe who went under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">Sannachies,</hi> repeated on his knees before the throne, in his own language, the genealogy of Alexander and his anceſtors, up to the firſt king of Scotland.</p><p>In 1250, the king, though no more than ten years of age, was married to the daughter of Henry, who now thought it a proper opportunity to cauſe him do homage for the whole kingdom of Scotland. But Alexander, notwithſtanding his youth, replied with great ſenſe and modeſty, that his buſineſs in England was matrimony; that he had come thither under Henry’s protection and invitation; and that he was no way prepared to anſwer inch a difficult queſtion.</p><p>Henry ſeems to have been encouraged to make this attempt by the diſtracted ſtate of the Scots affairs at that time; for, during the minority of the king, the nobility threw every thing into confuſion by their diſſenſions with one another. The family of Cummin were now become exceedingly powerful; and Alexander II. is blamed by Buchanan for allowing them to obtain ſuch an exorbitant degree of power, by which they were enabled almoſt to ſhake the foundation of government, Notwithſtanding the king’s refuſal to ſubmit to the homage required of him, they imagined that Henry’s influence was now too great; and fearing bad conſequences to themſelves, they withdrew from York, leaving Henry in full poſſeſſion of his ſon-in-law’s perſon. Henry, however, to ſhow that he deſerved all the confidence which could be repoſed m him, publicly declared, that he dropped all claim of ſuperiority with regard to the crown of Scotland, and that he would ever afterwards act as the father and guardian of his ſon-in-law; confirming his aſſurances by a charter. Yet when Alexander returned to Scotland, he found they had made a ſtrong party againſt his Engliſh connections. They now exclaimed, that Scotland was no better than a province of England; and having gained almoſt all the nobility over to this opinion, they kept the king and queen as two ſtate-priſoners in the caſtle of Edinburgh. Henry had ſecret intelligence of theſe proceedings; and his queen privately lent a phyſician whom ſhe could truſt, to inquire into her daughter’s ſituation. Having found means of being admitted into the young queen’s preſence, ſhe gave him a moſt lamentable account of her ſituation. She ſaid, that the place of their confinement was very unwholeſome, in conſequence of which their health was in imminent danger; and that they had no concern in the affairs of government. Hiſtorians do not inform us by what means they were reduced to this diſmal ſituation; only in general, that the Cummins uſurped the whole power of the ſtate. Henry did not well know how to act. If he proceeded at once to violent meaſures, he was afraid of the lives of his daughter and ſon-in-law; and, on the other hand, by a more cautious conduct, he leſt them expoſed to the wicked attempts of thoſe who kept them in thraldom, ſome of whom, he very well knew, had deſigns on the crown itſelf. By advice of the Scots royaliſts, among whom were the earls of Dunbar, Fife, Stratherne, Carric, and Robert de Bruce, Henry aſſembled his military tenants at York, from whence he himſelf advanced to Newcaſtle, where he publiſhed a maniſeſto, diſclaiming all deſigns againſt the peace or independency of Scotland; declaring, that the forces which had been collected at York were deſigned to maintain both; and that all he meant was to have an interview with the king and queen upon the borders. From Newcaſtle he proceeded to Wark, where he privately diſpatched the Earl of Gloceſter, with his favourite John Manſel, and a train of truſty followers, to gain admiſſion into the caſtle of Edinburgh, which was then held by John Baliol and Robert de Roſs, noblemen of great influence both in England and Scotland.
