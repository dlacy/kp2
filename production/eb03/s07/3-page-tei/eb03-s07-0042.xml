But the greatest number, at leaſt of the ancient ſurnames, were borrowed from the names of places. Camden ſays, that there is not a village in Normandy but has given its name to ſome family in England, He mentions as examples, Percy, Devereux, Tankervil, Mortimer, Warren, &amp;c. They were introduced with William the Conqueror. Several have been derived from places in the Netherlands, as Gaunt, Tournay, Grandiſon ; and many from the names of towns and villages in England and Scotland, as Wentworth, Markham, Murray, Aberdeen. Many have been formed from the names of animals, as quadrupeds, birds, fiſhes ; from vegetables, and parts of vegetables, as trees, ſhrubs, flowers, and fruits ; from minerals of different kinds. Others are formed from ſuch a variety of accidents that it is impoſſible to particularize them.</p><p>SURPLICE, the habit of the officiating clergy in the church of England. By Can. 58, every miniſter ſaying the public prayers, or miniſtering the ſacrament or other rites of the church, ſhall wear a decent and comely ſurplice with ſleeves, to be provided at the charge of the pariſh. But by 1 Eliz. c. 2. and 13 and 14 Car. II. the garb preſcribed by act of parliament, in the ſecond year of king Edward the Sixth, is enjoined : and this requires that in the ſaying or ſinging of matins and even ſongs, baptizing and burying, the miniſter in pariſh churches and chapels ſhall uſe a ſurplice. And in all cathedral churches and colleges, the archdeacon, dean, provoſts, maſters, prebendaries, and fellows, being graduates, may uſe in the choir, beſides their surplices, ſuch hoods as pertain to their ſeveral degrees. But in all other places every miniſter ſhall be at liberty to uſe a ſurplice or not. And hence in marrying, churching of women, and other offices not ſpecified in this rubric, and even in the adminiſtration of the holy communion, it ſeems that a ſurplice is not neceſſary. Indeed for the holy communion the rubric appoints a white ALB plain, which differs from the ſurplice in being cloſe-ſleeved, with a veſtment or cope.</p><p>SURREBUTTER, in law, is ſecond rebutter ; or the replication of the plaintiff to the defendant’s rebutter.</p><p>SURREJOINDER, is a ſecond defence of the plaintiff’s declaration, by way of anſwer to the defendant’s rejoinder.</p><p>SURRENDER, in common law, a deed or inſtrument, teſtifying that the particular tenant of lands and tenements, for life or years, doth ſufficiently conſent and agree, that he who has the next or immediate remainder or reverſion thereof, ſhall have the preſent eſtate of the ſame in poſſeſſion ; and that he hereby yields and gives up the ſame to him, ſo that the eſtate for life or years may merge or drown by mutual agreement of the parties. Of ſurrenders there are three kinds ; a ſurrender properly taken at common law ; a ſurrender of copyhold or cuſtomary eſtates ; and a ſurrender improperly taken, as of a deed, a patent, &amp;c. The first is the uſual ſurrender, and it is uſually divided into that in deed, and that in law.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender,</hi> in deed, is that which is really made by expreſs words in writing, where the words of the leſſee to the leſſor prove a ſufficient aſſent to ſurrender his eſtate back again.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender,</hi> in law, is that wrought by operation of the law, and which is not actual.—As if a man have a lease of a farm for life or years, and during the term he accepts a new leaſe ; this act is, in law, a ſurrender of the former.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surrender</hi> of a bankrupt. See <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Commission</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Bankruptcy.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Surrender</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Copyholds</hi> is the yielding up of the eſtate by the tenant into the hands of the lord, for ſuch purpoſes as are expressed in the ſurrender : as to the uſe and behoof of A and his heirs, to the uſe of his own will, and the like. This method of conveyance is ſo eſſential to the nature of a copyhold eſtate, that it cannot poſſibly be transferred by any other aſſurance. No feoffment, fine, or recovery (in the king’s courts) hath any operation upon it. If 1 would exchange a copyhold with another, I cannot do it by an ordinary deed of exchange at the common law, but we muſt ſurrender to each other’s uſe, and the lord will admit us accordingly. If I would deviſe a copyhold, I muſt ſurrender it to the uſe of my laſt will and teſtament ; and in my will I muſt declare my intentions, and name a deviſee, who will then be entitled to admiſſion.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">surrender</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Letters Patent and Offices.</hi> A ſurrender may be made of letters patent to the king, ſo that he may grant the eſtate to whom he pleaſes, &amp;c. and a ſecond patent for years to the ſame perſon for the ſame thing is a ſurrender in law of the first patent. 10 Rep. 66. If an officer for life accepts of another grant of the ſame office, it is in law a ſurrender of the first grant ; but if ſuch an officer takes another grant of the ſame office to himſelf and another, it may be otherwiſe.</p><p>SURREPTITIOUS. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Subreptitious.</hi></p><p>SURROGATE, in law, denotes a perlon that is ſubſtituted or appointed in the room of another.</p><p>SURRY, a county of England, bounded on the west by Berkſhire and Hampſhire, on the ſouth by Suſſex, on the eaſt by Kent, on the north by Middleſex, from which it is parted by the Thames, whence it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Suth-rey </hi>from the Saxons, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the country on the ſouth side of the river. It is 38 miles in length from eaſt to weſt, 23 in breadth from north to ſouth, and 112 in circumference. It contains 13 hundreds, 140 pariſhes, of which 35 are vicarages, 13 market-towns, 450 villages, 59200 acres, and about 170,000 inhabitants. The members lent from it to parliament are 14, of which two are ſent by each of the following boroughs, viz. Southwark, Bleechingley, Ryegate, Guildford, Gatton, Haſlemere, and two for the county.</p><p>The air of this county, towards the middle, which conſiſts moſtly of hills and heath, is ſharp, but pure and wholeſome. About the ſkirts, where it is more level, and the ſoil richer, the air is milder, but alſo ſalubrious. In the middle parts the ſoil is barren enough in general ; but towards the extremities, and where the country is open and champaign, it is fruitful in graſs and corn, particularly on the ſouth ſide in Holmſdale, in which meadows, woods, and corn-fields, are agreeably intermixed. The ſoil is alſo very fertile along the Thames, eſpecially towards London, where it greatly contributes to maintain plenty in the Lon</p></body></text></TEI>
