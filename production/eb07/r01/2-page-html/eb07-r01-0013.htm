<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">In treating of the construction and mode of working railways, we shall confine ourselves principally to those which are intended for the transit of passengers and goods, and&nbsp;which are now opening so vast a field for the improvement&nbsp;of the human race ; an improvement, in fact, entering into&nbsp;all the relations between man and man, and which no one,&nbsp;be he ever so sanguine, can venture to fix a limit to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the middle of the seventeenth century various contrivances have been in use for decreasing friction on roads, particularly near the collieries in the north, such as laying&nbsp;down tracks of wood and stone for the wheels of waggons; it&nbsp;having been found that the much greater quantity of work&nbsp;performed by horses on these tracks, or, in other words, the&nbsp;less number of horses required to do a given portion of labour, more than repaid the expenses attendant on forming&nbsp;the tracks. These, in general, gave way to the flat or tram&nbsp;rail, made of iron ; but the improvements were very slow, and&nbsp;at last were only applicable to certain circumscribed localities and materials for carriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Possessing little general interest, and chiefly benefiting individuals, the attention they attracted was principally confined to the parties immediately connected with them. But&nbsp;how different is the prospect now before us, since we have&nbsp;seen the magnificent creations of George Stephenson ? Pack-horses are still the only mode of transit for traffic in many&nbsp;parts of the world ; and within seventy years this was the&nbsp;general mode of conveyance for the carrying trade to Yorkshire and Lancashire from the west of England and Birmingham. In the year 1830, when the London and Birmingham&nbsp;railway was projected, the expense of constructing it was stated at L.6000 per mile with one line of rails, which were to be&nbsp;worked by horses, and warranted to go eight miles an hour ;&nbsp;now the public are complaining of going </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font0"> twenty miles an&nbsp;hour, and we have a right to expect that, at no very distant&nbsp;period, this velocity will at least be doubled ; in fact, at the&nbsp;rate improvements have been advancing for the last few years,&nbsp;we know not where to place a limit of increase in speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is of these splendid creations that we have here to speak. We shall shew the method of conducting a modern railway,&nbsp;from itsearliest commencement, through all its various stages&nbsp;in each department, both in and out of doors, up to the period of its final completion ; and shall end by explaining the&nbsp;method of setting it in full operation, pointing out, in each&nbsp;division of the labour, those modes of proceeding which will&nbsp;most conduce to a satisfactory result, and marking those&nbsp;things which practice has shewn should be avoided ; collecting the contrivances and appliances which have been found&nbsp;useful, from whatever source they may be derived, and setting a beacon upon shipwrecks, that they may become other&nbsp;men’s landmarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wllen a railway is proposed between any two places, the public want to know how to distinguish between a bubble&nbsp;speculation, got up by a few interested individuals, a crudely-formed and hastily-adopted, but really good project, and&nbsp;a line got up with care and attention through all its parts,&nbsp;shewing it to be the result of patient research and of matured judgment ; and according as inquirers find the following directions more or less attended to, they may place confidence in the scheme which is laid before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These undertakings generally begin with a few individuals interested in the line of railway proposed, when the project is honestly intended ; but the great mass of original&nbsp;proprietors are men of a speculative and adventurous turn</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of mind, who enter into these concerns for the mere purpose of making money’. If the thing succeeds, and the shares rise to a large premium, as they often do, the original holders&nbsp;realize the profits at once, by selling out, and then apply their&nbsp;surplus capital in other projects, with the same hope of gain.&nbsp;These people, by going out, make way for another class of&nbsp;proprietors, namely, those who look to their shares as a permanent investment, and hope to make by them a greater&nbsp;annual receipt than they can get in the public funds, or by&nbsp;any other means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the earlier stages the directors are generally self-elected. They should be men of local interest, rather than the lions who are too often found in these situations ; men who&nbsp;can influence members of Parliament in either house, conciliate landholders, get off the shares, &amp;c., and, above all, they&nbsp;should be of regular and businesslike habits. After a few&nbsp;meetings, they will find out what are their respective qualifications, and can allot themselves into sub-committees accordingly ; some to look after the traffic, others the surveying, others the share list, others to attend to the canvassing&nbsp;along the line, &amp;c. Almost their first duty will be to choose&nbsp;the secretary, the engineer, the solicitor, and the banker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the appointment of the first three much of the future success of the company will depend. The secretary should&nbsp;be a man of firmness and nerve, with conciliatory and gentlemanly manners ; of a strong habit of body, able to rough&nbsp;it out in travelling, and possessing a stock of scientific and&nbsp;mechanical knowledge. If he is a draughtsman so much the&nbsp;better, and he should have been habituated to command&nbsp;large bodies of men, and be able to make a public speech&nbsp;at a short notice. With these qualifications, habits of order,&nbsp;and plain common sense, he will be a most valuable man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The engineer must be judged of by the works he has executed, either by himself or under the direction of a superior; the first, of course, being the most conclusive, but the second by no means to be neglected. Skill and genius may&nbsp;Often be very prominent in subordinate situations. Of course,&nbsp;all other things being equal, one who has been employed on&nbsp;railways should be preferred to one who has not. The solicitor should, if possible, have been connected with a railway&nbsp;bill before, and should have not only ability, but zeal. The&nbsp;advantage of having one who bad been connected with a previous undertaking is obvious, and if he has had much experience in parliamentary business, so much the better; a local&nbsp;acquaintance amongst the landow<sup>r</sup>ners and residents along&nbsp;the line is also of much use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We suppose that, prior to advancing even thus far, the promoters of the undertaking have travelled between the termini of the intended railroad, and have ascertained that there are&nbsp;no engineering difficulties of a marked character ; and from&nbsp;our present stage, if the share list be found to fill, we have&nbsp;next to ascertain the nature and quantity of the traffic, first,&nbsp;as to whether it will pay for a railroad at all, and secondly,&nbsp;for what kind of a railroad. These questions should be met&nbsp;openly and honestly, or the consequences will be most&nbsp;disastrous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proper way to gain a correct knowledge of the traffic along any given line of country is, first of all, to station a&nbsp;man by day and another by night for two or three weeks, to&nbsp;count all vehicles passing a given number of spots along the&nbsp;intended line, (these spots should be near the principal&nbsp;towns), leaving out the largest terminus, as, for instance,&nbsp;London, and keeping the men on that side of all the respec-</span></p>
