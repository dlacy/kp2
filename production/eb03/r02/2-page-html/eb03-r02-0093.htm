<p><span class="font0">one ſuggeſted, that ſuppoſing the child were not baptized at all, he ſaw not how it could affect his happi-neſs. Though the converſation was not purſued, the hint ſtruck Mr Robinſon’s mind ; and he immediately&nbsp;determined to read the New Teſtament with this particular view, to examine what it ſaid concerning the baptiſm of infants. He accordingly began with the Goſpel of Matthew ; and, in ſucceſſion, peruſed the hiſtorical and epiſtolary books ; in expectation that he ſſiould&nbsp;find in every following part what he had not met with&nbsp;in the preceding parts of the ſacred volume ; namely,&nbsp;paſſages recommending and urging this rite. But obſerving, on the whole, a total ſilence about it, he thought&nbsp;it his duty to relinquiſh the practice, as without foundation in the rule of our faith ; which appeared to him&nbsp;to ſpeak only of the baptiſm of believers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This change of his ſentiments was more unfavourable than the former alterations in his religious judgment&nbsp;to bis worldly views ; and having married very early in&nbsp;life from pure affection, he was involved in great difficulties for near 12 years after his ſettlement in Cambridge ; as, in that courſe of time, his family became&nbsp;numerous, and the ſupport of an aged mother, as well&nbsp;as of a wife and ten children, depended upon him.&nbsp;But unexpected ſupplies, from quarters of which he&nbsp;was ignorant, frequently relieved his neceſſities, and&nbsp;confirmed his truſt in Providence : yet the ſituation of&nbsp;his family muſt, it is eaſy to conceive, have much affected his mind. For he appears to have poſſeſſed great&nbsp;tenderneſs and ſenſibility, and to have regarded with&nbsp;peculiar endearment his domeſtic connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be reckoned a circumſtance worthy of mention, that the ſphere of Mr Robinſon’s miniſtry was the ſame in which his great-grandfather Mr Shelly, of&nbsp;Jeſus College, and vicar of All-Saints, had, with others,&nbsp;diſſuſed the principles of the Puritans, about the beginning of the laſt century. The reputation of the Diffen-ters in the univerſity and neighbourhood had for almoſt&nbsp;a century been linking into contempt, when Mr Robinſon ſettled with the baptiſt church at Stone-Yard.<sup>z</sup> His&nbsp;abilities and aſſiduity, however, raiſed their reputation.&nbsp;The place in which his people aſſembled, which was at&nbsp;firſt a barn, afterwards a ſtable and granary, and then a&nbsp;meeting-houſe, but ſtill a damp, dark, and ruinous place,&nbsp;ſoon became too ſmall for the audience ; and ſeveral of&nbsp;the new auditors being men of fortune, they purchaſed&nbsp;the fite, and erected at their own expence a new houſe&nbsp;in the year 1764.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His labours as a preacher were not limited to the town of Cambridge ; but ſoon after bis coming there,&nbsp;he ſet up ſeveral lectures in the adjacent villages. His&nbsp;lectures were either annual or occaſional, or ſtated on&nbsp;fixed days. The uſual time was half an hour after fix&nbsp;in the evening ; and ſometimes at five in the morning ;&nbsp;and now and then in the ſummer at two in the afternoon, for the ſake of thoſe who came from a diſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He died on the 9th of June 1790, at the houſe of William Ruſſel,Eſq;of Showell green near Birmingham.&nbsp;He had laboured under an alarming diſorder for ſome&nbsp;time before; but on the Sunday preceding his death he&nbsp;preached a charity ſermon. On Monday he was ſeized&nbsp;with a fit ; on Tueſday he recovered and went to bed&nbsp;tolerably well, and was found dead next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The abilities of Mr Robinſon were very conſiderable, as appears from his numerous works ; and he poſſeſſed</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the quality of expreſſing his thoughts in an eaſy and a forcible manner. But he appears to have been of an&nbsp;unſteady temper, and, in our opinion, acquires but little&nbsp;credit either from the frequency with which he changed his religious creed (for we have reaſon to believe&nbsp;he died a Socinian), or from the fooliſh and undeſerved&nbsp;acrimony with which he treated the Church of England. His Plan of Lectures on the Principles of Nonconformity, for the Inſtruction of Catechumens, is a&nbsp;piece of the moſt unjuſt and illiberal abuſe that we have&nbsp;ever ſeen, and would have diſgraced the moſt high flying Puritan of the laſt century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Robinſon’s largeſt work, the Hiſtory of Baptiſm and of the Baptiſts, was publiſhed ſince his death, and&nbsp;is written in the ſame ſtyle and with the ſame confidence&nbsp;as his other works. Yet, as we have heard it remarked&nbsp;by a learned and liberal profeſſor of Theology in the&nbsp;church which he oppoſed, it is not a little remarkable&nbsp;that there is in it no argument or fact againſt infant baptiſm which was not anſwered by Dr Wall nearly 100&nbsp;years ago, of whoſe arguments Mr Robinſon however&nbsp;takes no notice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROCHEFORT, a handſome and conſiderable town of France in the territory of Aunis. It was conſtructed by Louis XIV. and is built in the midſt of marſhes&nbsp;expreſsly drained for that purpoſe ; and time evinced&nbsp;the utility of the project, for as a port it ſoon became&nbsp;as neceſſary and important to the crown of France as&nbsp;Breſt or Toulon. It has a department of the marine,&nbsp;and has large magazines of naval ſtores. There is&nbsp;alſo one of the ſineſt halls of arms in the kingdom,&nbsp;and a great many workmen employed in making them ;&nbsp;there are alſo forges for anchors, and work-houſes for&nbsp;ſhip-carpenters, who are employed in every thing that&nbsp;relates to the fitting out of ſhips that come within the&nbsp;compaſs of their province. They likewiſe call great&nbsp;guns here ; and have artiſts, whoſe employment is&nbsp;ſculpture and painting. There are alſo ſtocks for building men of war, rope-walks, magazines of proviſions&nbsp;and powder, a manufactory of fail-cloth, an hoſpital for&nbsp;ſailors, and proper places to clean the ſhips. Add to&nbsp;theſe, the houſes of the intendant, the ſquare of the&nbsp;capuchins, and the ſuperb ſtructure which contains&nbsp;lodgings for 300 marine guards, where they are taught&nbsp;the buſineſs and exerciſes belonging to ſeamen and officers who go on board the men of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beſide the uſual number of workmen which were employed at Rochefort during the monarchy, which&nbsp;amounted to about 900, there were about 600 galley&nbsp;ſlaves, occupied in the moſt painful and laborious&nbsp;branches of ſervice. The town is ſituated on the river&nbsp;Charente, about five leagues from its mouth, and was&nbsp;fortified by Louis XIV. at the time he conſtructed it ;&nbsp;but its ſituation is at ſo conſiderable a diſtance from the&nbsp;ſea, as to render it ſufficiently ſecure from any attack, and&nbsp;they have therefore cloſed up the battlements, and neglected the fortifications. The town is laid out with&nbsp;great beauty and elegance. The ſtreets are all very&nbsp;broad and ſtraight, extending through the v hole place&nbsp;from ſide to ſide ; but the buildings do not correſpond&nbsp;with them in this reſpect, as they are moſtly low and irregular.
