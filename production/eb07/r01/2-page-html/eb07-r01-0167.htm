<p><span class="font0">demonstrate anything concerning the impulsion of a fluid, estimated in the direction of its motion, we must consider&nbsp;it as demonstrated concerning the resistance of a quiescent&nbsp;fluid to the motion of that body, having the same velocity&nbsp;in the opposite direction. The determination of these impulsions being much easier than the determination of the&nbsp;motions communicated by the body to the particles of the&nbsp;fluid, this method will be followed in most of the subsequent&nbsp;discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general proposition already delivered is by no means sufficient for explaining the various important phenomena&nbsp;observed in the mutual actions of solids and fluids. In particular, it gives us no assistance in ascertaining the modifications of this resistance or impulse, which depend on the&nbsp;shape of the body and the inclination of its impelled or resisted surface to the direction of the motion. Sir Isaac&nbsp;Newton found another hypothesis necessary ; namely, that&nbsp;the fluid should be so extremely rare, that the distance of&nbsp;the particles may be incomparably greater than their diameters. This additional condition is necessary for considering their actions as so many separate collisions or impulsions on a solid body. Each particle must be supposed&nbsp;to have abundant room to rebound, or otherwise escape,&nbsp;after having made its stroke, without sensibly affecting the&nbsp;situations and motions of the particles which have not yet&nbsp;made their stroke ; and the velocity must be so great as not&nbsp;to give time for the sensible exertion of their mutual forces&nbsp;of attraction and repulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Keeping these conditions in mind, we may proceed to determine the impulsions made by a fluid on surfaces of&nbsp;every kind. The most convenient method of proceeding&nbsp;in this determination, is to compare them all either with&nbsp;the impulse which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">same surface</span><span class="font0"> would receive from the&nbsp;fluid impinging on it perpendicularly, or with the impulse&nbsp;which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">same stream of fluid</span><span class="font0"> would make when coming&nbsp;perpendicularly on a surface of such extent as to occupy&nbsp;the whole stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be convenient to premise the following definitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stream,</span><span class="font0"> we mean a quantity of fluid moving in one direction, that is, all the particles moving in parallel lines ;&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">breadth</span><span class="font0"> of the stream is a line perpendicular to all&nbsp;these parallels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filament</span><span class="font0"> is a portion of this stream of very small breadth, and it consists of an indefinite number of particles&nbsp;following one another in the same direction, and successively impinging on, or gliding along, the surface of the solid&nbsp;body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">base</span><span class="font0"> of any surface exposed to a stream of fluid, is that portion of a plane perpendicular to the stream, which&nbsp;is covered or protected from the action of the stream by&nbsp;the surface exposed to its impulse. Thus the base of a&nbsp;sphere exposed to a stream of fluid is its great circle, whose&nbsp;plane is perpendicular to the stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Direct impulse</span><span class="font0"> expresses the energy or action of the particle or filament, or stream of fluid, when meeting the surface perpendicularly, or when the surface is perpendicular to the direction of the stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Absolute impulse</span><span class="font0"> means the actual pressure on the impelled surface, arising from the action of the fluid, whether striking the surface perpendicularly or obliquely ; or it is&nbsp;the force impressed on the surface, or tendency to motion&nbsp;which it acquires, and which must be opposed by an equal&nbsp;force in the opposite direction, in order that the surface&nbsp;may be maintained in its place. It is of importance to&nbsp;keep in mind, that this pressure is always perpendicular to&nbsp;the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Relative</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">effective impulse</span><span class="font0"> means the pressure on the surface estimated in some particular direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">angle of incidence</span><span class="font0"> is the angle contained between tne direction of the stream and the impelled plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">angle of obliquity</span><span class="font0"> is the angle contained between the plane and the direction in which we wish to estimate&nbsp;the impulse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prop. II. The direct impulse of a fluid on a plane surface, is to its absolute oblique impulse on the same surface, as&nbsp;the square of the radius to the square of the sine of the&nbsp;angle of incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let a stream of fluid, moving in the direction FG (fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1), act on the plane BC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Draw CA perpendicular &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to FG, and equal to CB,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and BD parallel to FG,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">meeting AC in D. Let</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the particle F, moving in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the direction FG, meet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the plane in,G, and in FG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">produced take GH to re</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">present the magnitude of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the direct impulse, or the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">impulse which the particle</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">would exert on the plane</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AC, by meeting it in E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also draw GI and HK</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">perpendicular to BC, and HI perpendicular to GL</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The force GH is equivalent to the two forces GI and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">GK ; and GK being in the direction of the plane, has no share in the impulse. The absolute impulse, therefore, is&nbsp;represented by GI; the angle GHI is equal to FGC, the&nbsp;angle of incidence ; and therefore GH is to GI as radius to&nbsp;the sine of the angle of incidence : Therefore the direct&nbsp;impulse of each particle or filament is to its absolute oblique&nbsp;impulse as radius to the sine of the angle of incidence.&nbsp;But further, the number of particles or filaments which&nbsp;strike the surface AC, is to the number of those which&nbsp;strike the surface BC as AC to DC : for all the filaments&nbsp;between A and D go past the oblique surface BC without&nbsp;striking it. But BC : DC = rad. : sin. DBC, = rad. : sin.&nbsp;FGC, = rad. : sin. incidence. Now the whole impulse is&nbsp;as the impulse of each filament, and as the number of filaments exerting equal impulses jointly ; therefore the whole&nbsp;direct impulse on AC is to the whole absolute impulse on&nbsp;BC, as the square of radius to the square of the sine of the&nbsp;angle of incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let F represent the direct impulse,/the absolute oblique impulse, A the area of the plane, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> the angle of incidence ; and let the tabular sines and cosines be considered as decimal fractions of the radius 1. The proposition&nbsp;gives us F :/ = 1 : sin? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font0"> and therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0">= F × sin? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Also, because impulses are in the proportion of the extent&nbsp;of surface similarly impelled, we have, in general,/ = FA&nbsp;X sin.<sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first who published this theorem was Pardies, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres de Mathématique,</span><span class="font0"> in 1673. Newton, however, had&nbsp;investigated the chief proposition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Principia</span><span class="font0"> before&nbsp;1670.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prop. III. The direct impulse on any surface is to the effective oblique impulse on the same surface, as the cube of radius to the solid, which has for its base the square of&nbsp;the sine of incidence, and the sine of obliquity for its&nbsp;height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let GO be the direction, and draw IO perpendicular to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">GO. Now, when GH represents the direct impulse of a particle, GI is the absolute oblique impulse, and GO is the&nbsp;effective impulse in the direction GO : But GI is to GO&nbsp;as radius to the sine of GIO, and GIO is the complement&nbsp;of IGO, and is therefore equal to CGO, the angle of obliquity ; whence, assuming </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font0"> to denote the effective oblique&nbsp;impulse, and O = the angle of obliquity, we have</span></p>
