<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phan,</span><span class="font0"> the latter part of this word, is unquestionably the same with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pan,</span><span class="font0"> the most ancient of the Egyptian gods. It&nbsp;is likewise a cognate of the Hebrew<sup>r</sup> Phanah, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conspexit,&nbsp;spectavit, vidit ;</span><span class="font0"> and the radical word seems to be Phah, or&nbsp;Phthah, which signifies sometimes the countenance, and&nbsp;sometimes light. Hence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phaethon,</span><span class="font0"> which is compounded&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pha,</span><span class="font0"> light ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">eût</span><span class="font0"> or esA, fire ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">on,</span><span class="font0"> strength ; came to&nbsp;be one of the names of the Sun. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rai,</span><span class="font0"> which we commonly&nbsp;write </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rajah,</span><span class="font0"> has long signified, amongst the Indians, a&nbsp;subordinate prince ; and we know that between India and&nbsp;Egypt there was a very early intercourse. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raiphan,</span><span class="font0"> therefore, may be either the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">royal light</span><span class="font0"> or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bright prince,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">subordinate to Osiris ; and in either sense it was a very proper epithet of Sothis in the Egyptian !calendar. The word&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rem</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rom,</span><span class="font0"> again, for it is sometimes written Remphan,&nbsp;and sometimes Roropha, is no other than the Hebrew n∏,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rum,</span><span class="font0"> high or exalted. Hence Remphan is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">high</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exalted light,</span><span class="font0"> which Sothis certainly was.

<p><span class="font0">REMUS, the brother of Romulus, was exposed, together with his brother, by the cruelty of his grandfather. In the&nbsp;contest which happened between the two brothers about&nbsp;building a city, Romulus obtained the preference ; and&nbsp;Remus, for ridiculing the rising walls, was put to death by&nbsp;his brother’s orders, or by Romulus himself. After this&nbsp;murder the Romans were afflicted with a plague ; upon&nbsp;which the oracle w<sup>r</sup>as consulted, and the manes of Remus&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>ere appeased by the institution of the Remuria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REMY, Sτ, a city of France, in the department of the Mouths of the Rhone, and arrondissement of Arles. It&nbsp;stands on a fruitful plain, and is celebrated for the marble&nbsp;found near it, as well as for valuable Roman antiquities, especially a triumphal arch, and a lofty mausoleum which is&nbsp;still in good preservation. The city contains 930 houses,&nbsp;with 6200 inhabitants, who manufacture serges and other&nbsp;cloths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RENAPOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the Nizam’s territories, and province of Aurungabad, seventy-one miles north-west from Beeder. Long. 76. 55. E. Lat. 10. 20. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RENDSBURG, a city of the Danish dominions, in Holstein. It is built on the river Eider, by which it is divided into the old and the new town. It is strongly fortified, being&nbsp;the bulwark of Denmark towards Germany. The great&nbsp;canal ends at this place. It is a tow<sup>r</sup>n of considerable trade,&nbsp;especially of breweries and distilleries ; and here is the chief&nbsp;government military arsenal. It contains 545 houses, and&nbsp;7572 inhabitants. Long. 9. 34. E. Lat. 54. 18. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RENFREW, the chief town of a shire or county of the same name, in Scotland, situated on the south bank of the&nbsp;river Clyde, about six miles below<sup>r</sup> Glasgow, and three northeast of Paisley. It w<sup>r</sup>as made a burgh by David I., who began&nbsp;to reign in 1124, and is undoubtedly the most ancient town&nbsp;in Renfrewshire. In 1396 Robert III. raised it to the rank&nbsp;of a royal burgh, and it is the only place in the county which&nbsp;enjoys that distinction. The name is apparently derived from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhyn</span><span class="font0"> in the British, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riηn</span><span class="font0"> in the Gaelic, both meaning a&nbsp;point of land ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">freu</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">frau,</span><span class="font0"> in the British, meaning a&nbsp;flow’ of water. This forms an apt description, the town being situated on a point of land near the conflux of the rivers&nbsp;Clyde and Cart. Assuming that the name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Renfrew</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;anciently applied to the site of the burgh, it is easy to understand how<sup>r</sup> it would be given to the burgh itself, and afterwards be extended first to the barony, and then to the&nbsp;sheriffdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Renfrew’ possesses considerable historical interest. Here Somerled, Lord of the Isles, who rose in rebellion against&nbsp;Malcolm IV., was defeated and slain in 1164. Thefamily&nbsp;of Stewart had their common residence at this place before&nbsp;they were called to the throne. Even after that event Robert II., and probably also some of his successors, occasionally resided here. The mansion of the Stew arts no longer&nbsp;exists ; but its site </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font0">still called “ Castlehill,” and near it is&nbsp;“ the King’s Meadow.” In former times the waters of the&nbsp;Clyde separated into two branches at Renfrew, and formed&nbsp;an insular piece of ground, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inch,</span><span class="font0"> on which there stood another ancient edifice, called “ the Inch Castle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This town had once a little foreign trade. In a charter granted by James VI., in the year 1614, it is described as&nbsp;the principal port on the Clyde. A century later, its chief&nbsp;traffic w<sup>r</sup>as with Ireland. At present, some vessels in the inland trade load and unload at the harbour. About fifty years&nbsp;ago, a navigable canal was formed between tile town and&nbsp;the river ; and at the mouth of this canal a commodious&nbsp;quay was built in 1835, at an expense of about L.800. Some&nbsp;salmon-fishings on the Clyde have long belonged to the&nbsp;burgh. The principal occupation of the inhabitants is hand-loom weaving, in which 561 persons were employed in the&nbsp;year 1836. That Renfrew has but little participated in the&nbsp;prosperity which commerce and manufactures have diffused&nbsp;all around, is evident from the fact, that the population of&nbsp;the parish, which in 1801 had amounted to 2031, had in&nbsp;1831 increased to only 2833. It contains a constituency&nbsp;of ninety-five qualified voters, and is joined with Ruther-glen, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, and Port-Glasgow, in sending a member to parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RENFREWSHIRE, acounty in Scotland, lying between 55. 40. 40. and 55. 58.10. north latitude, and 4.15. and 4.&nbsp;52. 30. west longitude, is bounded on the east by Lanarkshire, on the south by Ayrshire, and on the north and w<sup>r</sup>est&nbsp;by the river and frith of Clyde, which separate it from the&nbsp;shires of Dumbarton and Argyle, excepting a section of&nbsp;about 1300 imperial acres, which is situatctl on the north&nbsp;bank of the Clyde, opposite the town of Renfrew. Its greatest length is thirty-one miles and a half, and its greatest&nbsp;breadth thirteen miles and a fourth. Its area is 241 square&nbsp;miles, or 154,240 acres, of which about 100,000 are cultivated, 20,000 uncultivated, and 34,240 unprofitable. Notwithstanding the small extent of this shire, its manufactures and&nbsp;commerce render it one of the most important in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the epoch of the Roman invasion, in the first century of the Christian era, this part of Scotland was inhabited by&nbsp;a Celtic tribe, called by the invaders the Damnii. After&nbsp;the withdrawal of the Romans, it w<sup>r</sup>as comprehended in the&nbsp;British kingdom of Stratlldyde.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The district which now forms the county of Renfrew, at least the greater part of it, was denominated, from one&nbsp;of its rivers, Strathgryfe, the valley of the Gryfe, and at one&nbsp;time formed part of the shire of Lanark or Clydesdale. It&nbsp;was the chief patrimony of the great stewards of Scotland,&nbsp;to whom it was granted by the sovereign in the twelfth century. Afterwards it was called the barony of Renfrew’, from&nbsp;the burgh of that name, where the stewards long had their&nbsp;principal residence. In 1404, thirty-three years after the&nbsp;accession of the house of Stewart to the Scottish throne,&nbsp;King Robert III. granted this barony, and the other portions of the estates of the steward, to his son and heir James;&nbsp;since which time the eldest son of the sovereign has, besides&nbsp;his other titles, bome that of “ Baron of Renfrew.” Soon&nbsp;afterwards this barony was erected into a distinct sheriffdom, the courts of which were held at Renfrew till the year&nbsp;1705, when they were, for convenience sake, removed to&nbsp;Paisley. In 1815 the county was formed into two wards,&nbsp;termed the Upper and the Lower, with a sheriff-substitute&nbsp;for each, Paisley and Greenock being the seats of their respective courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Renfrew shire comprehends twenty-one parishes, besides small portions of those of Beith and Dunlop in Ayrshire,&nbsp;and Govan in Lanarkshire. Two of the parishes, Eagle-sham and Cathcart, belong to the presbytery of Glasgow ;&nbsp;the other nineteen composed the presbytery of Paisley for&nbsp;a long time prior to the year 1834, when two presbyteries&nbsp;w<sup>,</sup>ere formed ; that of Paisley, consisting of twelve of these&nbsp;nineteen parishes ; and that of Greenock, consisting of the</span></p>
