(William), a learned Engliſh divine in the 17th century, was born in 1641, and educated at Eaton ſchool, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the vigour of his genius and his application to ſtudy. Thence he was removed to Cambridge, where he took bis degrees. In 1669 he became rector of the pariſh of St George, Botolphlane, in London ; and in 1681 was collated to the prebend of Pancras, in the cathedral of St Paul’s. He was likewiſe choſen maſter of the Temple, and had the rectory of Therfield in Hertfordſhire. After the Revolution he was ſuſpended from his preferment, for refuſing the oaths to king William and queen Mary ; but at laſt he took them, and publicly juſtified what he had done. In 1691 he was installed dean of St Paul’s. His Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity engaged him in a warm controverſy with Dr South and others. Biſhop Burnet tells us, he was “ a clear, a polite, and a ſtrong writer ; but apt to aſſume too much to himſelf, and to treat his adverſarſes with contempt.” He died in 1707. His works are very numerous ; among theſe are, 1. A Diſcourſe concerning the Knowledge of Jesus Chriſt, againſt Dr Owen. 2. Several pieces againſt the Papiſts, the Socinians, and Dissenters. 3. A practical Treatiſe on Death, which is much admired. 4. A practical Discourſe on Providence. 5. A practical Diſcourſe on the future Judgment ; and many other works.</p><p>Sherlock (Dr Thomas), biſhop of London, was the ſon of the preceding Dr William Sherlock, and was born in 1678. He was educated in Catharine-hall, Cambridge, where he took his degrees, and of which he became maſter : he was made maſter of the Temple very young, on the reſignation of his father ; and it is remarkable, that this maſterſhip was held by father and ſon ſucceſſively for more than 70 years. He was at the head of the oppoſition againſt Dr Hoadley biſhop of Bangor ; during which conteſt he publiſhed a great number of pieces. He attacked the famous Collins’s “ Grounds and Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion,” in a courſe of six fermons, preached at the Temple church, which he intitled “ The Uſe and Intent of Prophecy in the ſeveral Ages of the World.” In 1728, Dr Sherlock was promoted to the biſhopric of Bangor ; and was tranſlated to Saliſbury in 1734. In 1747 he refuſed the archbiſhopric of Canterbury, on account of his ill ſtate of health ; but recovering in a good degree, accepted the ſee of London the following year. On occasion of the earthquakes in 1750, he publiſhed an excellent Paſtoral Letter to the clergy and inhabitants of London and Weſtminſter : of which it is ſaid there were printed in 4t0, 5000 ; in 8vo, 20,000 ; and in 12mo, about 30,000 ; beſide pirated editions, of which not leſs than 50,000 were ſuppoſed to have been sold. Under the weak ſtate of body in which he lay for ſeveral years, he reviſed and publiſhed 4 vols of Sermons in 8vo, which are particularly admired for their ingenuity and elegance. He died in 1762, and by report worth 150,000h “ His learning,” ſays Dr Nicholls, “ was very extensive : God had given him a great and an underſtanding mind, a quick comprehension, and a ſolid judgment. Theſe advantages of nature he improved by much induſtry and application. His ſkill in the civil and canon law was very conſiderable ; to which he had added ſuch a knowledge of the common law of England as few clergymen attain to. This it was that gave him that influence in all cauſes where the church was concerned ; as knowing preciſely what ſt had to claim from its conſtitutions and canons, and what from the common law of the land.” Dr Nicholls then mentions his conſtant and exemplary piety, his warm and fervent zeal in preaching the duties and maintaining the doctrines of Chriſtianity, and his large and diffusive munificence and charity ; particularly by his having given large ſums of money to the corporation of clergymens ſons, to ſeveral of the hoſpitals, and to the ſociety for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts : alſo his bequeathing to Catharine-hall in Cambridge, the place of his education, his valuable library of books, and his donations for the founding a librarian’s place and a ſcholarſhip, to the amount of ſeveral thouſand pounds.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
