<p><span class="font1">ROEMER, Ole (Latinized Olaus) (1644-1710), Danish astronomer, was born at Aarhuus in Jutland, 25th September 1644. He studied mathematics at the university of&nbsp;Copenhagen until 1671, when he assisted Picard in determining the geographical position of Tycho Brahe’s&nbsp;observatory (Uranienburg on the island of Huen). In&nbsp;1672 he accompanied Picard to Paris, where he remained&nbsp;nine years, occupied with observations at the new royal&nbsp;observatory and hydraulic works at Versailles and Marly.&nbsp;In 1675 he read a paper before the Academy on the successive propagation of light as revealed by a certain inequality in the motion of the first of Jupiter’s satellites&nbsp;(see Parallax, vol. xviii. p. 251). In 1681 he returned&nbsp;to Copenhagen, where he spent the remainder of his days&nbsp;as professor of astronomy, but his great ability and practical talents were made use of in several other public&nbsp;employments. He died on 23d September 1710.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roemer’s name is now best known by his discovery of the finite velocity of light. Most of his contemporaries doubted the reality&nbsp;of this discovery, chiefly because the eclipses of the three outer&nbsp;satellites of Jupiter did not show similar irregularities to those&nbsp;exhibited by the first satellite. This is not surprising, as the&nbsp;mutual attraction of the satellites makes their motions far more&nbsp;complicated than astronomers imagined before the development of&nbsp;the theory of gravitation, and it should perhaps be chiefly ascribed&nbsp;to chance that Roemer brought forward his theory, which Bradley’s&nbsp;discovery of the aberration of light about fifty years later proved to&nbsp;be a true one. Roemer’s ingenuity has, however, appeared very prominently in the important improvements which he carried out in&nbsp;the construction of astronomical instruments. The large “ armil-lary spheres, ” first constructed by the astronomers of Alexandria&nbsp;and also used by Tycho Brahe, had been superseded by the meridian&nbsp;or mural quadrant for measuring meridian zenith distances, and by&nbsp;the sextant for measuring distances between stars in order to find&nbsp;their difference of right ascension by solving the spherical triangle&nbsp;between the pole and the two stars. Both these instruments were&nbsp;introduced by Tycho Brahe. Roemer, however, saw that Tycho’s&nbsp;idea of making the rotating earth itself an astronomical instrument&nbsp;by observing the transits of stars across the meridian could be&nbsp;carried out better by fixing a telescope at right angles to a horizontal axis placed exactly east and west, so that the telescope could&nbsp;only move in the meridian. The first transit instrument was constructed in 1689 and erected in Roemer’s house in 1690. In the&nbsp;same year he erected in the university observatory an instrument&nbsp;with altitude and azimuth circles (for observing equal altitudes on&nbsp;both sides of the meridian) and an equatorial instrument. In 1704&nbsp;he constructed a private observatory at Vridlösemagle, a few miles&nbsp;west of Copenhagen, and mounted a meridian circle (the transit&nbsp;instrument and vertical circle combined) and a transit instrument&nbsp;moving in the prime vertical. Roemer may thus be considered the&nbsp;inventor of nearly all our modern instruments of precision, and it&nbsp;is much to be regretted that his ideas were not adopted by astronomers until about a century later. All the results of his observations were destroyed in a great conflagration in 1728, except three&nbsp;days’ work, which has been discussed by Galle (O. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roemeri triduum&nbsp;οbservatiοnum astrœnœmiearum a. 1706 institutarurn,</span><span class="font0"> Berlin, 1845).&nbsp;His disciple Horrebow has left us a very detailed description of&nbsp;Roemer’s instruments and ideas in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opera mathematico-physiea&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(3 vols., Copenhagen, 1740-41). Grant’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Physical Astronomy</span><span class="font0"> (London, 1852) gives a very correct account of Roemer and&nbsp;his inventions.

<p><span class="font1">ROERMOND or Roermonde (t,β., “ Roer-Mouth ”), a town of the Netherlands in the province of Limburg&nbsp;(formerly Guelderland), on the right bank of the Maas&nbsp;(Meuse) at the mouth of the Roer, which separates it from&nbsp;the suburb of St Jacob. It is 29 ⅜ miles from Maestricht&nbsp;by the railway to Venlo (opened 1865). The old fortifications were dismantled in 1819 and have been partly&nbsp;turned into promenades. At this point the Maas is crossed&nbsp;by a bridge erected in 1866-67, and the Roer by one dating&nbsp;from 1771 and replacing the older structure destroyed in&nbsp;1764. The finest building in the town is the Romanesque&nbsp;minster church, begun in 1218, and dedicated by Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne. In the middle of the nave&nbsp;is the tomb of Count Gerhard III. of Guelderland and his&nbsp;wife Margaret. The cathedral of St Christopher is also&nbsp;of note ; on the top of the tower (246 feet) is a copper&nbsp;statue of the saint and the interior is adorned with paintings by Rubens, Jacob de Wit, &amp;c. The Reformed church&nbsp;was once the chapel of the monastery of the Minorites.&nbsp;The old bishop’s palace is now the court-house, and the&nbsp;old Jesuits’ monastery with its fine gardens is now occupied as a higher burgher school. Woollen, cotton, silk,&nbsp;and mixed stuffs, paper, flour, and beer are manufactured&nbsp;at Roermond. The population of the town was 5712 in&nbsp;1840 and 8797 in 1870; and that of the commune has&nbsp;increased from 6005 in 1840 to 10,470 in 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Till the 13th century Roermond was only a village with a hunting lodge known as Pot. The erection of the monastic church in 1218 was followed by the building of town walls in 1231 by Count&nbsp;Otho II. In 1543 Roermond was occupied by the troops of Charles&nbsp;V., and in the course of the Eighty Years’ War few places more&nbsp;frequently changed hands. The peace of Münster (1648) left it in&nbsp;the Spanish Netherlands ; but between 1702 and 1716 it was held&nbsp;by the forces of the United Provinces.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER I., “ grand count ” of Sicily, the twelfth and youngest son of Tancred de Hauteville in Normandy, was&nbsp;born about 1031. He joined his brother Robert Guiscard&nbsp;(7.v.) in Italy in 1058, and after taking part with him in&nbsp;his conquests on the mainland passed over to Sicily in 1061.&nbsp;There such success attended his arms that in 1071 he took&nbsp;the title of count; in 1089 he became “grand count” and&nbsp;in 1098 received from the pope for himself and his successors the title of “ legate apostolical ” in Sicily. He died&nbsp;in 1101. See Sicily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROGER IL, count of Sicily, son of the preceding, was born about 1093 and died in 1154. He obtained from&nbsp;the antipope Anacletus II. the title of king of Sicily in&nbsp;1130, and was crowned in the same year. The title was&nbsp;afterwards confirmed in 1139 by Innocent II. See Sicily.</span></p>
