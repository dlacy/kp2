The monarch afterwards not only refuſed to repay him, but even confined him, and endangered his life. Rabi-rius eſcaped from Egypt with difficulty ; but at his re-turn to Rome he was accuſed by the ſenate of having lent money to an African prince for unlawful purpoſes. He was ably defended by Cicero, and acquitted with difficulty.—There was a Latin poet of the ſame name in the age of Auguſtus. He wrote a poem on the victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at Actium. Seneca has compared him to virgil for ele-gance and majeſty ; but Quintilian is not fo favourable to his poetry. —And there was an architect in the reign of Domitian, called <hi rend="italic">Rabirius.</hi>  He built a celebrated palace for the emperor, of which the ruins are ſtill feen at Rome.</p><p>RACCOON.

The fa-mous George earl of Cumberland is recorded to have wafted more of his eſtate than any of his anceſtors ; and chiefly by his extreme love to horſe-races, tiltings, and other expenſive diverfions. It is probable that the parſimonious queen did not approve of it ; for races are not among the diverfions exhibited at Kennelworth by her favourite Leiceſter. In the following reign, were places allotted for the ſport: Croydon in the fouth, and Garterly in Yorkſhire, were celebrated courſes.

He had a fine genius for the <hi rend="italic">Belles Lettres,</hi>  and became one of the firſt poets of the age. He produced his <hi rend="italic">Thebαide</hi>  when but very young ; and afterwards other pieces, which met with great ſucceſs, though they appeared when Corneille was in his higheſt reputation. In his career, however, he did not fail to meet with all that oppoſition which envy and cabal are ever ready to ſet up againſt a ſuperior genius. It was partly owing to a chagrin from this circumſtance that he took a refolution to quit the theatre for ever ; although his genius was ſtill in full vigour, being not more than 38 years of age. But he had alſo imbibed in his in-fancy a deep ſenſe of religion ; and this, though it had been ſmothered for a while by his connections with the theatre, and particularly with the famous actreſs Champ-melle, whom he greatly loved, and by whom he had a ſon, now at length broke out, and bore down all before it. In the ſirſt place, he reſolved not only to write no more plays, but to do a rigorous penance for thoſe he had written ; and he actually formed a deſign of be-coming a Carthuſian friar. His religious director, however, a good deal wiſer than he, adviſed him to think-more moderately, and to take meaſures more fuita⅛Ie to his character. He put him upon marrying, and-ſettling in the world : with which propoſal this humble and tractable penitent complied ; and immediately took to wife the daughter of a treaſurer of France for Amiens, by whom he had ſeven children.</p><p>He had been admitted a member of the French academy in 1673, *<hi rend="sup">n</hi> the <hi rend="sup">room θ</hi>f La Mothe le vayer deceaſed ; but ſpoiled the ſpeech he had made upon that occaſion by pronouncing it with too much timidity. In 1677, he was nominated with Boileau, with whom he was ever in ſtrict friendſhip, to write the hiſtory of Louis XIV. ; and the public expected great things from two writers of their diſtinction, but were difappointed. Boileau and Racine, after having for ſome time laboured at this work, perceived that it was en* tirely oppoſite to their genius.</p><p>He ſpent the latter years of his life in compoſing a hiſtory of the houſe of Port-Royal, the place of his education ; which, however, though finely drawn up, as many have aſſerted, has not bcen publiſhed. Too great ſenfibility, ſay his friends, but more properly an impotence of ſpirit, ſhortened the days of this poet.—-Though he had converſed much with the court, he had not learned the wiſdom, which is uſually learned there, cf diſguifing his real fentiments. Having drawn up a well-reafoned and well-written memorial upon the mife-ries of the people, and the means of relieving them, he one day lent it to Madam de Maintenon to read ; when the king coming in, and demanding what and whoſe it was, commended the zeal of Racine, but diſapproved of his meddling with things that did not . concern him : and faid with an angry tone, " Becauſe he knows how to make .good verſes, does he think he knows every thing? And would he be a miniſter of ſtate, becauſe he is a great poct ?” Theſe words hurt Racine greatly : he conceived dreadful ideas of the king’s diſpleaſure ; and his chagrin and fears brought on a fever, of which he died the 2 2d of April 1699.</p><p>Thc king, who was ſenſible of his great merit, and always loved him, ſent often to him in his illneſs ; and finding after his death that he had more glory than riches, ſettled a handſome penſion upon his family.— There is nothing in the French language written with . more wit and elegance than his pieces in proſe. Be-ſides his plays, ſeveral of his letters have been publiſhed-; he alſo wrote ſpiritual ſongs, epigrams, &amp;c. Racine’s</p></body></text></TEI>
