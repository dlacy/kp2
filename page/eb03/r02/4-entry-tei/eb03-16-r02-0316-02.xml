<p><label>ROCKINGHAM</label>
a town in Northamptonſhire, in England, 87 miles from London, ſtands on the river Welland. It has a charity-ſchool, a market on Thursday, and a fair on Sept. 8. for five days. Its foreſt was reckoned one of the largeſt and richeſt of the kingdom, in which William the Conqueror built a caſtle ; it extended, in the time of the ancient Britons, almoſt from the Welland to the Nen, and was noted formerly for iron-works, great quantities of flags, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the refuſe of the iron-ore, being met with in the adjacent fields. It extended, according to a ſurvey in 1641, near 14 miles in length, from the weſt end of Middleton-Woods to the town of Mansford, and five miles in breadth, from Brigſtock to the Welland!; but is now diſmembered into parcels, by the interpoſition of fields and towns, and is divided into three bailiwicks. In ſeveral of its woods a great quantity of charcoal is made of the tops of trees, of which many waggon-loads are ſent every year to Peterborough. There is a ſpacious plain in it called Rockinghamſhire, which is a common to the four towns of Cottingham, Rockingham, Corby, and Gretton. King William Rufus called the council here of the great men of the kingdom. W. Long. 0. 46. N. Lat. 52. 32.</p>
