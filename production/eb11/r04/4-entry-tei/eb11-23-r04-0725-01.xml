               <p>                   <label>ROSAS, JUAN MANUEL</label> (1793-1877), tyrant of Buenos Aires, was
                    born on the 30th of March 1793, in the city of that name. His father, Leon Ortiz
                    de Rosas, was an owner of cattle runs <hi rend="italic">(estancias)</hi> and a
                    trader in hides, who took an active part in defeating the English attack on the
                    city in 1807. Juan Rosas received so little education that he had to learn to
                    read and write when he was already a married man and a successful cattle
                    breeder. From a very early age he was left in charge of one of his father’s
                    establishments. When he was eighteen he married Maria de la Encarnacion Eseurra.
                    His mother having suspected him of appropriating money, he left his parents, and
                    for some time subsisted by working as a <hi rend="italic">vaquero</hi> or
                    cowboy, and then as overseer on the estates of other owners; but he accumulated
                    money, and by the help of a loan from a friend he became possessed of a cattle
                    run of his own, Los Cerrillos. The anarchical state of the country since its
                    independence of Spain had favoured the Indians, who had taken the offensive and
                    raided up to within forty miles of Buenos Aires. Rosas obtained leave to arm his
                    cowboys. Under his management Los Cerrillos became a refuge for adventurers,
                    whom he paid and fed well, but from whom he exacted implicit obedience. His
                    followers became a fighting force of acknowledged efficiency, and Rosas took
                    practically the position of an independent ruler whose help was sought by
                    contending political parties. By attending to his own interest only, and by
                    astute intrigue, or savage fighting when necessary, he grew in power from 1820
                    onwards, and from 1835 to 1852 ruled as dictator (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Argentina).</hi> It is probable that he would have continued to govern in
                    Buenos Aires till his death if his ambition had not led him into wars with all
                    his neighbours. He wished to extend the authority of the Republic over all the
                    territory which had belonged to the Spanish viceroyalty of Buenos. This led him
                    directly into wars with Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile, and into “ warlike
                    operations ” with England and France, with whom he had other causes of quarrel
                    arising out of the complaints of traders and bondholders. His government was
                    overthrown in 1852 by a coalition of his neighbours and the defection of several
                    of his generals, and even members of his own family who lived in fear of his
                    suspicions and violence. He took refuge in England, and lived at Swaythling,
                    near Southampton, till his death on the 14th of March 1877. A portrait taken in
                    1834 and reproduced by Sir Woodbine Parish in his <hi rend="italic">Buenos Ayres
                        and Provinces of the Rio de là Plata</hi> (London, 1852) represents Rosas as
                    a fine-looking man of the handsome Spanish type.</p>               <p>See 0. Martens, <hi rend="italic">Ein Caligula unseres Jahrhunderts</hi>
