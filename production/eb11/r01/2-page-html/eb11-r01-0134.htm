<p><span class="font2">and pictures. Although a devout student of the Shastras, he advocated female education and social reform. Refusing to&nbsp;cross the sea and so break caste by appearing before a parlia-mentary commission, he yet preached religious toleration. A&nbsp;patron of the Indian Congress, he borrowed from the armoury&nbsp;of British administration every reform which he introduced&nbsp;into the native states. He was respected alike by Europeans&nbsp;and natives, and received titles and honours from the British&nbsp;government. As tutor of the maharaja of Travancore, and&nbsp;then as revenue officer in that state, he showed firmness and&nbsp;ability, and became diwan or prime minister in 1857. He&nbsp;found the finances disorganized, and trade cramped by monopolies and oppressive duties. He co-operated with the Madras&nbsp;government in carrying out reforms, and when his measures&nbsp;led to misunderstandings with the maharaja, he preferred&nbsp;honourable resignation to retention of a lucrative office in which&nbsp;he was powerless for good. In 1872 he was engaged at Indore&nbsp;in laying down a plan of reform and of public works which he&nbsp;bequeathed to his successor, when a grave crisis at Baroda&nbsp;demanded his talents there. The Gaekwar had been deposed&nbsp;for scandalous misrule, and an entire reorganization was needed.&nbsp;Aided by Sir Philip Melvill, Madhava Rao swept away the&nbsp;corrupt officials, privileged sirdars and grasping contractors&nbsp;who had long ruined Baroda. He wrote able minutes defending&nbsp;the rights and privileges of the Gaekwar from fancied encroachment, and justifying the internal reforms which he introduced.&nbsp;He resigned office in 1882, and in his retirement devoted his&nbsp;leisure to reading and writing upon political and social questions.&nbsp;He died on the 4th of April 1891.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAOUL DE CAMBRAI, the name of a French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste.</span><span class="font2"> The existing romance is a 13th-century recension of a&nbsp;poem by a trouvère of Laon called Bertholais, who professed&nbsp;to have witnessed the events he described. It presents, like&nbsp;the other provincial </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">geste</span><span class="font2"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Garin le Loherain,</span><span class="font2"> a picture of the&nbsp;devastation caused by the private wars of the feudal chiefs.&nbsp;A parallel narrative, obviously inspired by popular poetry, is&nbsp;preserved in the chronicle of Waulsort (ed. Achery, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spicilegium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">ii. p. 100 seq.),and probably corresponds with the earlier recension.&nbsp;Raoul de Cambrai, the posthumous son of Raoul Taillefer,&nbsp;count of Cambrai, by his wife Alais, sister of King Louis&nbsp;(d’Outre-Mer), whose father’s lands had been given to another,&nbsp;demanded the fief of Vermandois, which was the natural inheritance of the four sons of Herbert, lord of Vermandois. On&nbsp;King Louis’s refusal, he proceeded to war. The chief hero on&nbsp;the Vermandois side was Bernier, a grandson of Count Herbert,&nbsp;who had been the squire and firm adherent of Raoul, until he&nbsp;was driven into opposition by the fate of his mother, burned&nbsp;with the nuns in the church of Origny. Bernier eventually&nbsp;slew the terrible Raoul in single fight, but in his turn was slain,&nbsp;after an apparent reconciliation, and the blood-feud descended&nbsp;to his sons. The date of these events is exactly ascertainable.&nbsp;Flodoard (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Annales, Anno</span><span class="font2"> 943) states that Count Herbert died&nbsp;in that year, and was buried by his sons at St Quentin, that&nbsp;when they learnt that Raoul, son of Raoul de Gouy, was about&nbsp;to invade their father’s territory, they attacked him and put&nbsp;him to death. The identity of other of the personages of the&nbsp;story has also been fixed from historical sources. The second&nbsp;part of the poem, of which Bernier is the hero, is of later date,&nbsp;and bears the character of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">roman d’aventures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAOUL ROCHETTE, DÉSIRÉ (1790-1854), French archaeologist, was bom on the 9th of March 1790 at St Amand in the department of Cher, and received his education at Bourges.&nbsp;He was made professor of history in the Collége de Louis-le-Grand at Paris (1813) and in the Sorbonne (1817). His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire critique de l'établissement des colonies grecques</span><span class="font2"> (4 vols.,&nbsp;1815) is now out of date.

<p><span class="font2">RAOULT, FRANÇOIS MARIE (1830-1901), French chemist, was born at Fournes, in the Département du Nord, on the 10th&nbsp;of May 1830. He became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aspirant répétiteur</span><span class="font2"> at the lycée of&nbsp;Rheims in 1853, and after holding several intermediate positions&nbsp;was appointed in 1862 to the professorship of chemistry in Sens&nbsp;lycée, where he prepared the thesis on electromotive force&nbsp;which gained him his doctor’s degree at Paris in the following&nbsp;year. In 1867 he was put in charge of the chemistry classes&nbsp;at Grenoble, and three years later he succeeded to the chair&nbsp;of chemistry, which he held until his death on the 1st of April&nbsp;1901. Raoult’s earliest researches were physical in character,&nbsp;being largely concerned with the phenomena of the voltaic&nbsp;cell, and later there was a period when more purely chemical&nbsp;questions engaged his attention. But his name is best known&nbsp;in connexion with the work on solutions, to which he devoted&nbsp;the last two decades of his life. His first paper on the depression&nbsp;of the freezing-points of liquids by the presence of substances&nbsp;dissolved in them was published in 1878; and continued investigation and experiment with various solvents, such as benzene&nbsp;and acetic acid, in addition to water, led him to believe in a&nbsp;simple relation between the molecular weights of the substances&nbsp;and the freezing-point of the solvent, which he expressed as the&nbsp;“ loi générale de la congelation,’’ that if one molecule of a&nbsp;substance be dissolved in 100 molecules of any given solvent,&nbsp;the temperature of solidification of the latter will be lowered&nbsp;by 0∙63° C. (See, however, the article Solution.) Another&nbsp;relation at which he worked was that the diminution in the&nbsp;vapour-pressure of a solvent, caused by dissolving a substance&nbsp;in it, is proportional to the molecular weight of the substance&nbsp;dissolved—at least when the solution is dilute. These two&nbsp;generalizations not only afforded a new method of determining&nbsp;the molecular weights of substances, but have also been utilized&nbsp;by J. H. van’t Hoff and W. Ostwald, among other chemists,&nbsp;in support of the hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation in&nbsp;solutions. An account of Raoult’s life and work was given by&nbsp;Professor van’t Hoff in a memorial lecture delivered before the&nbsp;London Chemical Society on the 26th of March 1902.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAOUX, JEAN (1677-1734), French painter, was born at Montpellier in 1677. After the usual course of training he became a member of the Academy in 1717 as an historical painter. His&nbsp;reputation had been previously established by the credit of&nbsp;decorations executed during his three years in Italy on the&nbsp;palace of Giustiniani Sclini at Venice, and by some easel paint-ings, the Four Ages of Man (National Gallery), commissioned&nbsp;by the grand prior of Vendôme. To this latter class of subject&nbsp;Raoux devoted himself, nor did he even paint portraits except&nbsp;in character. The list of his works is a long series of sets of the&nbsp;Seasons, of the Hours, of the Elements, or of those scenes of&nbsp;amusement and gallantry in the representation of which he was&nbsp;immeasurably surpassed by his younger rival Watteau. After&nbsp;his stay in England (1720) he lived much in the Temple, where&nbsp;he decorated several rooms. He died in Paris in 1734. His&nbsp;best pupils were Chevalier and Montdidier. His works, of&nbsp;which there is a poor specimen in the Louvre, were much&nbsp;engraved by Poilly, Moyreau, Dupuis, &amp;c.</span></p>
