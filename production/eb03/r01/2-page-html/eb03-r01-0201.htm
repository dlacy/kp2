<p><span class="font2">There ſhall be named one elector to the aſſembly, or not, according as there ſhall happen to be preſent 100&nbsp;active citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There ſhall be named two, when there ſhall be preſent from 151 to 250, and ſo on in this proportion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The members of the legiſſative body may be re-elect-ed to a ſubſequent legiſlature, but not till after an interval of one legiſſature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No active citizen can enter or vote in an aſſembly if he is armed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The repreſentatives ſhall meet on the ſirſt Monday of May, in the place of the ſittings of the laſt legiſiature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The royalty is indiviſible, and delegated hereditarily to the race on the throne from male to male, by&nbsp;order of primogeniture, to the perpetual excluſion of&nbsp;women and their defcendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nothing is prejudged on the effect of renunciations in the race on the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The perſon of the king is inviolable and ſacred ; his only title is king of the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the king put himſelf at the head oſ an army, and direct the forces of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">lt </span><span class="font2">againſt the nation, or if he do&nbsp;not oppoſe, by a formal act, any ſuch enterpriſe undertaken in his name, he ſhall be held to have abdicated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The nation makes proviſion for the ſplendour of the throne by a civil lift, of which the legiſiative body ſhall&nbsp;ſix the ſum at the commencement of each reign, for&nbsp;the whole duration of that reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The king is a minor till the age of 18 complete ; and during his minority there ſhall be a regent of the&nbsp;kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The regency belongs to the relation of the king, next in degree according to the order of ſucceffion to&nbsp;the throne, who has attained the age of 25 ; provided&nbsp;he be a Frenchman reſident in the kingdom, and not&nbsp;preſumptive heir to any other crown, and have pre-viouſiy taken the civic oath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&quot; The denomination of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prince</span><span class="font2"> cannot be given to any individual, and ſhall not cany with it any privilege&nbsp;or exception to the common right of all French citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the king alone belongs the choice and diſmiffion of miniſters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; The members of the nrcſent national aſſembly, and of the ſubſequent legiſſatures, the members of the tribunal of appeal, and thoſe who ſliall be of the high&nbsp;jury, cannot be advanced to the miniſtry, cannot receive&nbsp;any place, gift, penfion, allowance, or commiffion of&nbsp;the executive power or its agents during the continuance of their functions, or during two years after&nbsp;ceaſſng to exerciſe them : the ſame ſhall be obſerved re-ſpecting thoſe who ſhall only be inſenbed on the liſt&nbsp;of high jurors as long as their inſcription ſhall con-tinue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No order of the king can be executed if it be not ſigned by him, and counterſigned by the miniſter or&nbsp;comptroller of the department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In no caſe can the written or verbal order of a king ſhelter a miniſter from reſponſibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The conſtitution delegates ■ excluſively to the legiſia’ tive body the powers and functions following ;</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">During the whole courſe of war, the legiſſative body may require the king to negociate peace ; and the king&nbsp;is bound to yield to this requiſition.</span></p>
