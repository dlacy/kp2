If rigors happen during the time the patient labours under this  indiſpoſition, it generally implies that matter will be formed within the ſubſtance of the bone. If the extremities of the bone complained of begin, or if it becomes enlarged throughout its whole extent, it may be known to be an abſceſsus in medulla, or true spina ventoſa, as it is called : if neither of theſe ſymptoms take place, the great inſenſibility of the bone in ſome ſubjects will prevent that acuteneſs of pain uſual in other parts where matter is formed, though the acrid matter is eroding the bone during the whole time it is contained within it. This matter at length having made its way through, arrives at the perioſteum, where it creates moſt violent pain, as well from its ſharpneſs as from its increaſed quantity, occaſioning an extenſion of the perioſteum. The integuments then become ſwelled and inflamed, and have a sort of emphyſematous feel. On being examined by preſſure, the tumor will ſometimes be leſſened, from part of the matter retiring into the bone : from this appearance to the touch, moſt likely the name of <hi rend="italic">ventoſa</hi> was added to the term <hi rend="italic">ſpina.</hi> When we are aſſured of matter being under the perioſteum, we cannot be too early in letting it out, as it will lave a conſiderable deal of pain to the patient, though probably it may not be of any conſiderable advantage in respect to the carious bone ; for, where the fluids in general are vitiated, no chance of cure can be expected from topical remedies ; but where the conſtitution is mended, nature will ſometimes aſtoniſh us in her part, as the carious bone will be thrown off from the epiphyſes, or the teredines will be filled up by the oſſific matter that slows from the parts of the bone where ſome of the spinæ have come away.</p><p>If proper medicines are given, the children well ſupported, and the parts kept clean and dry, patience and perſeverance will frequently give great credit to the ſurgeon. In caſe it ſhould have been thought adviſable to apply a trephine, to give free diſcharge to the matter, the waſhing it away, as well as the ſmall crumblings of the carious bone, by means of deterſive and drying injections, has been known to contribute greatly to the curing this kind of caries, after the habit of body in general had been mended.</p><p>Beſides thoſe above-mentioned, the bones are liabe to two oppoſite diſeaſes ; the one termed friabilitas<hi rend="italic">,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">mollities ;</hi> the former peculiar to adults, the latter more frequent in infants, though ſometimes ſeen in adults, from a vitiated ſtate of their juices.</p><p>The bones, when deprived of their cementing liquor, by paſſing through fire, become friable. From repeated ſalivations, and in old people, they have been rendered extremely brittle ; insomuch that in many ſubjects they have been fractured merely from their weight and the action of the muſcles : but in ſuch caſes, this is not owing to the friability of the bones, but to the loſs of ſubſtance, from the eroſion of the bone by an acrimonious humour thrown on it ; to which cauſe perhaps may be attributed the diſeaſe called <hi rend="italic">rickets</hi> in children. The effects of ſcorbutic humour in rendering the bones ſoft in many inſtances, have often been remarked.</p><p>By proper diet, gentle friction with coarſe cloths, exerciſe, and cold bathing, rickety children will frequently get their conſtitution ſo much changed, as that, by the time they arrive at the age of 20 years, there ſhall not remain the leaſt veſtige of their former diſeaſe. The epiphyſes are generally moſt affected in this ſpecies of the diſorder. For want of early attention to invalids of this sort, we find that their bones not only become ſoft, and yield to the powers of the muſcles, but remain diſtorted the reſt of their lives, though they have acquired a perfect degree of ſolidity. In ſuch caſes, correcting the vitiated juices only will not reſtore the bones to their natural ſtate ; therefore the aſsistance of a ſkilful mechanic is neceſſary both to ſupport the parts improperly acted on, and to alter the line of direction of the diſtorted offeous fibres.</p><p>Though the curvature of the extremities, or thickneſs of the ends of the bones near their articulations, may give the firſt alarm to thoſe who are conſtantly with children, yet there are other ſymptoms that give earlier notice than theſe ; and had they been timely diſcovered by proper judges, it is highly probable that the curvature of the limbs in many children might not have happened. The belly generally becomes larger in this diſeaſe, from the increaſed ſize of the contained bowels, as it is not unlikely but that the meſenteric glands are the firſt parts obſtructed ; obſtructions of the liver, ſpleen, and pancreas, ſoon follow ; the head then becomes enlarged ; then a difficulty of breathing, which is generally ſuppoſed to be the effects of taking cold, ſucceeds ; the ſternum is elevated and ſharp, and the thorax becomes contracted ; the ſpine is protruded in ſeveral parts ; the pelvis altered, according to the preſſure of the parts within, and habitual inclination of the patient, at times, to obtain that line of direction in which the perpendicular from the centre of gravity may fall within the common baſe of the body, the extremities of the cylindrical bones, and the ends of the ribs next the ſternum, become enlarged ; ſoon after this the bones in general become ſoft and flexible, yielding in ſuch directions as the ſtrongeſt muſcles determine by their actions.</p><p>The bones of children who die of this diſorder, we obſerve, are not only rendered ſoft, but the veſſels within their ſubſtance are replete with blood of a texture totally broken, and having more the appearance of thin chocolate than blood : the perioſteum in many places is ſeparated, and the intermediate ſpace between it and the bone filled with extravaſated fluid ; and caries is almoſt as frequent as the ſeparation of the perioſteum. The muſeles in ſuch bodies generally appear pale and flabby.</p><p>Where the affection of the meſenteric glands is evident, Mr Bromefield aſſerts, that after a dose or two oſ the pulvis baſilſeus to empty the inteſtines thoroughly, the purified crude quickſilver is by much the möst efficacious medicine to remove obſtructions in thoſe glands. When the belly begins to ſoften and ſubſide, the chyle passes without interruption, and the child begins to get fleſh ; then the cold bath becomes truly ſerviceable, and the decoction or cold infuſion of the Peruvian bark is a proper reſtorative ; but the cold bath uſed too early, or the bark given before there is a free circulation of chyle through the lacteals, would be very injurious.</p><p>The mollities oſſium, in ſome caſes, may be produced from a redundancy of the oleaginous parts of the blood, or from a laxity of the ſolids, by which the fluids are not ſufficiently attenuated, nor properly blended and mixed : the conſequence of which will be obſtructed perſpiration, the habit in general loaded with groſs, phlegmatic, and ſerous humours, and the oſſific matter not united or condenſed as in an healthy ſtate. The method of cure confirms us in the cauſe of theſe ſymptoms ; for, by ſtrengthening the fibrous ſyſtem, by uſing gentle exerciſe, a dry diet, good air, aromatics, and cold bathing, this kind of invalids are generally reſtored to health.</p><p>Among the diſeaſes of the bones we may likewiſe take notice of that <hi rend="italic">palſy of the lower extremities</hi> which takes place, as is generally ſuppoſed, in conſequence of a curvature in ſome part of the ſpine. To this diſtemper both ſexes and all ages are equally liable. When it attacks an infant of only a year or two old or under, the true cauſe of it is ſel-</p></body></text></TEI>
