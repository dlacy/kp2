He next turned his arms againſt the Sabines, whom he entirely defeated in two engagements, and made the whole nation tributary ; for which exploits he decreed himſelf two triumphs, and on his return to Rome he employed the populace in finiſhing the ſewers and circus which had been begun by his grandfather Tarquin I.</p><p>In the mean time, the perſecutions of Tarquin a-gainſt his own ſubjects daily drove ſome of the moſt conſiderable into baniſhment. A great number of patricians took refuge in Gabii, a city of Latium about 13 miles from Rome 5 where the inhabitants, touched with compaſſion for their misfortunes, not only received them with kindneſs, but began a war with 'Γarquin on their account. The Gabini ſeem to have been the moſt formidable enemies whom the Romans had hitherto met with ; ſince Tarquin was obliged to raiſe a prodigious bulwark to cover the city on the ſide of Gabii. The war laſted ſeven years ; during which time, by the mutual devaſtations committed by the two armies, a great ſcarcity of proviſions took place in Rome. The people ſoon grew clamorous ; and Tarquin being unable either to quiet them, or to reduce the Gabini, fell upon the following diſhonourable and treacherous expedient. His ſon Sextus Tarquinius pretended to be on very bad terms with his father, and openly inveighed againſt him as a tyrant ; on which he was proclaimed a rebel, and publicly beaten in the forum. This being reported at Gabii, by perſons lent thither on purpoſe, the inhabitants became very deſirous of having Sextus among them ; and accordingly he ſoon went thither, having previouſly obtained a ſolemn promiſe from the inhabitants never to deliver him up to his father. Here he made frequent inroads into the Roman territories, and always came back laden with ſpoil, his father ſending againſt him only ſuch weak parties as muſt infallibly be worſted. By this means he ſoon came to have ſuch a high degree of credit among the Gabini, that he was choſen general of their army, and was as much maſter at Gabii as Tarquin was at Rome. Finding then that his authority was ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, he diſpatched a ſlave to his father for inſtructions ; but the king, unwilling to return an explicit anſwer, only took the meſ-ſenger into the garden, where he ſtruck off the heads of the talleſt poppies. Sextus undeι ſtood that by this hint the king deſired him to put to death the leading men in the city of Gabii, which he immediately put in execution ; and while the city was in confuſion on account of this maſſacre, he opened the gates to his father, who took poſſeſſion of the city with all the pride of a conqueror.·—The inhabitants dreaded every thing from the haughty tyranny of the Roman monarch : however, on tins occaſion he conſulted his policy rather than his revenge ; granted them their lite, liberty, and eſtates, and even entered into a treaty of alliance with them. The articles were written on the hide of an ox, which was ſtill to be ſeen in the time of Auguſtus, in the temple of Jupiter Fidius. After this, however, he made his ſon Sextus king of Gabii ; lending off alſo</p><lb/><p>his two other ſons, Titus and Arunx, the one to build a city at Signia, the other at Circæum, a promontory of the Tyrrhene ſea, and both theſe to keep the Volſci in awe.</p><p>For ſome time Tarquin now enjoyed a profound peace ; the Romans, being accuſtomed to oppreſſion and the yoke of an imperious maſter, malting no oppoſition to his will. During this interval Tarquin met with the celebrated adventure of the Sibyl f ; whoſe books were ever afterwards held in high eſtima-tion at Rome, and Tarquin appointed two perſons of diſtinction to take carc of them. Thoſe were called <hi rend="italic">Duumviri :</hi>  but their number was afterwards increaſed to 10, when they were called <hi rend="italic">Decemviri ;</hi>  and then to 15, when they were termed <hi rend="italic">Quindecemviri.</hi>  At this time alſo the written civil law had its origin among the Romans ; all the ſtatutes enacted by the kings being collected into one body ; which, from Papirius the name of the collector, was called the <hi rend="italic">Papiriaa</hi>  law. The temple of the Capitol was alſo finiſhed; for which purpoſe the moſt ſkilful architects and workmen were brought from Hetruria, the populace being obliged to ſerve them in the moſt laborious parts.</p><p>We now come to the important revolution which put an end to the regal power at Rome, and introduced a new form of government, to which this city is allowed to owe the greateſt part of her grandeur. Tarquin, as we have already ſeen, had left himſelf no friends among the rich citizens, by reaſon of the oppreſſion under which he made them labour ; and the populace were equally diſaffected on account of their being obliged to labour in his public works. Among the many perſons of diſtinction who had been ſacrificed to the avarice or ſuſpicions of Tarquin, was one M. Junius, who had married the daughter of Tarquin I. This nobleman had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">L. Junius Brutus,</hi>  who eſeaped the cruelty of the tyrant by pretending to be an idiot, which part he had ever ſince continued to act. Sooh after the finiſhing of the w0rk3 abovementioned, a violent plague happening to break out at Rome, Tarquin ſent bis ſons Titus and Arunk to conſult the oracle of Delphi ; and the princes took Brutus along with them, to divert themſelves with his pretended folly by the way. Brutus choſe for his offering to the Delphic A-pollo a ſtick of elder ; which occaſioned much laughter. However, he had the precaution to incloſe a rod of gold within the ſtick ; and to this probably it was owing, that the prieſteſs gave the princes the following riddle, that he who ſhould firſt kiſs his mother ſhould ſucceed Tarquin in the government of Rome. This anſwer had been given to their inquiries concerning the ſucceſſion ; upon which the two brothers either drew lots which of them ſhould kiſs their mother at their return, or agreed to do it at once, that both might reign jointly ; but Brutus, imagining the oracle had another meaning, fell down and kiſſed the earth, the common mother of all living. This, in all probability, the prieſteſs had meant ; and had given the anſwer on purpoſe to have another proof of Brutus’s ingenuity, which had already diſcovered itſelf, by his offering the elder ſtick.</p><p>On the return of the princes to Rome, they found, their father engaged in a war with the Rutuli. The treaſury being exhauſted by the ſums which Γarquin had expended in his public works, he had marched to</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
