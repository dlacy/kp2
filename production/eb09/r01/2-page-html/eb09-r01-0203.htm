<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">would have shrunk. It marked, moreover, in the condition of armed resistance against established authority which was forced upon it by the Counter-Reformation,&nbsp;a firm resolve to assert political liberty, leading in the&nbsp;course of time to a revolution with which the rebellious&nbsp;spirit of the Revival was sympathetic. This being the relation of humanism in general to reform, French learning in&nbsp;particular displayed such innovating boldness as threw&nbsp;many of its most conspicuous professors into the camp at&nbsp;war with Rome. Calvin, a French student of Picard origin,&nbsp;created the type of Protestantism to which the majority of&nbsp;French Huguenots adhered. This too was a moment at&nbsp;which philosophical seclusion was hardly possible. In a&nbsp;nation so tumultuously agitated one side or the other had&nbsp;to be adopted. Those of the French humanists who did&nbsp;not proclaim Huguenot opinions, found themselves obliged&nbsp;with Muretus to lend their talents to the Counter-Reformation, or to suffer persecution for heterodoxy, like Dolet.&nbsp;The church, terrified and infuriated by the progress of&nbsp;reform, suspected learning on its own account. To be an&nbsp;eminent scholar was to be accused of immorality, heresy,&nbsp;and atheism in a single indictment; and the defence of&nbsp;weaker minds lay in joining the Jesuits, as Heinsius was&nbsp;fain to do. France had already absorbed the earlier Renaissance in an Italianizing spirit before the Reformation&nbsp;made itself felt as a political actuality. This fact, together&nbsp;with the strong Italian bias of the Valois, serves to explain&nbsp;in some degree the reason why the Counter-Reformation&nbsp;entailed those fierce entangled civil wars, massacres of St&nbsp;Bartholomew, murders of the Guises, regicides, treasons,&nbsp;and empoisonments that terminated with the compromise of&nbsp;Henry IV. It is no part of the present subject to analyse&nbsp;the political, religious, and social interests of that struggle.&nbsp;The upshot was the triumph of the Counter-Reformation,&nbsp;and the establishment of its principle, absolutism, as the&nbsp;basis of French government, it was a French king who,&nbsp;when the nation had been reduced to order, uttered the&nbsp;famous word of absolutism, “ L’Etat, c’est moi.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Renaissance in the Low Countries, as elsewhere, had its brilliant age of arts and letters. During the Middle&nbsp;Ages the wealthy free towns of Flanders flourished under&nbsp;conditions not dissimilar to those of the Italian republics..&nbsp;They raised miracles of architectural beauty, which were&nbsp;• modified in the 15th and 16th centuries by characteristic&nbsp;elements of the new style. The Van Eycks, followed by&nbsp;Memling, Metsys, Mabuse, Lucas van Leyden, struck out&nbsp;a new path in the revival of painting and taught Europe&nbsp;the secret of oil-colouring. But it was reserved for the&nbsp;17th century to witness the flower and fruit time of this&nbsp;powerful art in the work of Porbus, Rubens, and Vandyck,&nbsp;in the Dutch schools of landscape and home-life, and in&nbsp;the unique masterpieces of Rembrandt. We have a right&nbsp;to connect this later period with the Renaissance, because&nbsp;the distracted state of the Netherlands during the 16th&nbsp;century suspended, while it could not extinguish, their&nbsp;aesthetic development. The various schools of the 17th&nbsp;century, moreover, are animated with the Renaissance&nbsp;spirit no less surely than the Florentine school of the 15th&nbsp;or the Venetian of the 16th. The animal vigour and&nbsp;carnal enjoyment of Rubens, the refined Italianizing&nbsp;beauty of Vandyck, the mystery of light and gloom on&nbsp;Rembrandt’s panels, the love of nature in Ruysdael, Cuyp,&nbsp;and Van Hooghe, with their luminously misty skies,&nbsp;silvery daylight, and broad expanse of landscape, the&nbsp;interest in common life displayed by Terburg, Van Steen,&nbsp;Douw, Ostade, and Teniers, the instinct for the beauty of&nbsp;animals in Potter, the vast sea spaces of Vanderveldt, the&nbsp;grasp on reality, the acute intuition into character in&nbsp;portraits, the scientific study of the world and man, the&nbsp;robust sympathy with natural appetites, which distinguish</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the whole art of the Low Countries, are a direct emanation from the Renaissance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The vernacular in the Netherlands profited at first but little by the impulse which raised Italian, Spanish,&nbsp;French, and English to the rank of classic languages.&nbsp;But humanism, first of all in its protagonist Erasmus,&nbsp;afterwards in the long list of critical scholars and editors,&nbsp;Lipsius, Heinsius, and Grotius, in the printers Elzevir and&nbsp;Plantin, developed itself from the centre of the Leyden&nbsp;university with massive energy, and proved that it was&nbsp;still a motive force of intellectual progress. In the fields&nbsp;of classical learning the students of the Low Countries&nbsp;broke new ground chiefly by methodical collection, classification, and comprehensive criticism of previously accumulated stores. Their works were solid and substantial&nbsp;edifices, forming the substratum for future scholarship.&nbsp;In addition to this they brought philosophy and scientific&nbsp;thoroughness to bear on studies which had been pursued in&nbsp;a more literary spirit. It would, however, be uncritical to&nbsp;pursue this subject further; for the encyclopaedic labours&nbsp;of the Dutch philologers belong to a period when the Renaissance was overpast. For the same reason it is inadmissible to do more than mention the name of Spinoza here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Netherlands became the battlefield of Reformation and Counter-Reformation in even a stricter sense than&nbsp;France. Here the antagonistic principles were plainly&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">i </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">posed in the course of a struggle against foreign despotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I The conflict ended in the assertion of political independence as opposed to absolute dominion. Europe in large measure&nbsp;owes the modern ideal of political liberty to that spirit&nbsp;of stubborn resistance which broke the power of Spain.&nbsp;Recent history, and in particular the history of democracy,&nbsp;claims for its province the several stages whereby this&nbsp;principle was developed in England and America, and its&nbsp;outburst in the frenzy of the French Revolution. It is&nbsp;enough here to have alluded to the part played by the Low&nbsp;Countries in the genesis of a motive force which may be&nbsp;described as the last manifestation of the Renaissance&nbsp;striving after self-emancipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The insular position of England, combined with the nature of the English people, has allowed us to feel the&nbsp;vibration of European movements later and with less of&nbsp;shock than any of the Continental nations. Before a wave&nbsp;of progress has reached our shores we have had the&nbsp;opportunity of watching it as spectators, and of considering how we shall receive it. Revolutions have passed&nbsp;from the tumultuous stages of their origin into some&nbsp;settled and recognizable state before we have been called&nbsp;upon to cope with them. It was thus that England took&nbsp;the influences of the Renaissance and Reformation simultaneously, and almost at the same time found herself&nbsp;engaged in that struggle with the Counter-Reformation&nbsp;which, crowned by the defeat of the Spanish Armada,&nbsp;stimulated the sense of nationality and developed the&nbsp;naval forces of the race. Both Renaissance and Reformation had been anticipated by at least a century in England.&nbsp;Chaucer’s poetry, which owed so much to Italian examples,&nbsp;gave an early foretaste of the former. Wickliffe’s teaching&nbsp;was a vital moment in the latter. But the French wars,&nbsp;the Wars of the Roses, and the persecution of the Lollards&nbsp;deferred the coming of the new age; and the year 1536,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I when Henry VIII. passed the Act of Supremacy through Parliament, may be fixed as the date when England&nbsp;entered definitively upon a career of intellectual development abreast with the foremost nations of the Continent.&nbsp;The circumstances just now insisted on explain the specific&nbsp;character of the English Renaissance. The Reformation&nbsp;had been adopted by consent of the king, lords, and&nbsp;commons; and this change in the state religion, though it&nbsp;was not confirmed without reaction, agitation, and blood-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
