<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">« Sixthly,</span><span class="font1"> Infects being thctr food, I </span><span class="font0">never </span><span class="font1">ſaw any toad ſhow any liking or diſlike to any plant (d).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; Seventhly,</span><span class="font1"> 1 hardly remember any perfops taking it up except my father and myielf ; 1 do not know&nbsp;whether it had any particular attachment to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eighthly,</span><span class="font1"> In reſpect to its end, I anſwer this laſt query. Had it not been for a tame raven, I make no&nbsp;doubt but it would have been now living ; who one day&nbsp;feeing it at the month of its hole, pulled it out, and although I reſcued it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it ſo,&nbsp;that notwithſtanding its living a twelvemonth it never&nbsp;enjoyed itſelf, and had a difficulty of taking its food,&nbsp;miffing the mark for want of its eye : before that accèdent it had all the appearance of perfect health.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rubeta, or natter-jack, frequents dry and fan-dy places : it is found on Putney common, and alſo&nbsp;near Reveſhy abbey, Lmcolnſhire. It never leaps, neither does it crawl with the flow pace of a toad, but its&nbsp;motion is liker to running. Several are found commonly together, and like others of the genus they appear&nbsp;in the evenings. The upper part of the body is of a&nbsp;dirty yellow, clouded with brown, and covered with porous pimples,of unequal ſizes : on the back is a yellow&nbsp;line. The upper fide of the body is of a paler hue,&nbsp;marked with black ſpots, which are rather rough. Οη&nbsp;the fore-feet are four divided toes ; on the hind five, a&nbsp;little webbed. The length of the body is two inches&nbsp;and a quarter; the breadth, one and a quarter: the&nbsp;length of the fore-legs, one inch one-ſixth ; of the hind&nbsp;legs, two inches, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font1">are indebted to SirJoſeph Banks,&nbsp;for this account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pipal, or Surinam toad, is more ugly than&nbsp;even the common one. The body is flat and broad ;&nbsp;the head ſmall ; the jaws, like thoſe of a mole, are extended, and evidently formed for rooting in the ground :&nbsp;tlιe ſkin of the neck forms a fort of wrinkled collar:&nbsp;the.colour of the head is of a dark cheſnut, and the&nbsp;eyes are ſmall : the back, which is vcry broad, is of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">hghtiſh grey, and feems covered over with a number of&nbsp;ſmall eyes, which are round, and placed at nearly equal&nbsp;diſtances. Theſe eyes are very different from what they&nbsp;ſeem : they are the animal’s eggs, covered with their&nbsp;ſhells, and placed therc for hatching. Thefe eggs are&nbsp;buried deep in the ſkin, and in the beginning of incubation but juſt appear j and are very viſible when the&nbsp;young animal is about to burſt from its confinement.&nbsp;They are of a reddiſh, ihining yellow colour ; and the&nbsp;ſpaces between them are full oſ ſmall warts, reſembling&nbsp;pearls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is their ſituation previous to their coming forth ; but nothing ſo much demands our admiration as the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">manner of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">their production. The egga, when formed </span><span class="font1">i∏ tſie ovary, are ſent, by ſome internal canals, which&nbsp;anatomiſts have not hitherto deſcribed, to lie aηd come&nbsp;to maturity under the bony ſubſtance of the back : in&nbsp;this ſtate they are impregnated by the male, whoſe ſeed&nbsp;finds its way by pores very ſingularly contrived, and&nbsp;pierces not only the ſkin but the perioſteum : the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſkin,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">however, is ſtill apparently entire, and forms a very&nbsp;thick covering ever the whole brood ; but as they advance to maturity, at different intervals, one after another, the egg ſeems to ſtart forward, and burgeons&nbsp;from the back, becomes more yellow, and at laſt breaks j&nbsp;when the young one puts forth its head : it ſtill, however, keeps its ſituation until it has acquired a proper&nbsp;degree of ſtrength, and then it leaves the ſhell, but ſtill&nbsp;continues to keep upon the back of the parent. In&nbsp;this manner the pipal is ſeen travelling with her won-derous family on her back, in all the different ſtages of&nbsp;maturity. Some of the ſtrange progeny, not yet come&nbsp;to ſufficient perfection, appear quite torpid, and as yet&nbsp;without life in the egg : others ſeem juſt beginning tts&nbsp;riſe through the ſkin ; here peeping forth from the&nbsp;ſhell, and there having entirely forſaken their priſon ;&nbsp;ſome are ſpprting at large upon the parent’s back, and&nbsp;others defcending to the ground to try their own fortune&nbsp;below. The male pipal is every way larger than the fe-male, and has the ſkin leſs tightly drawn round the body. The whole body is covered with pullules, reſembling pearls ; and the belly, which is of a bright yel-low, ſeems as if it were ſewed up from the throat to&nbsp;the vent,. a feam being ſeen to run in that direction.&nbsp;This animal, like the reſt of the frog kind, is moſt probably harmleſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water frog of Cateſhy has large black eyes*&nbsp;yellow irides, and long limbs : the upper part of the&nbsp;head and body is of a duſky green, fpotted with black ;&nbsp;and from each eye to the noſe is a white line ; and alfi&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">yellow line along the ſides to the rump. They fre-quent rivulets and ditches, which they do not quit </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the dry land. It is ſaid they will ſpring five or ſix&nbsp;yards at a leap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rana arborea, or green tree frog of Cateſhy,&nbsp;is of a ſlender ſhape and bright green colour, marked or»&nbsp;each ſide with a line of yellow : the eyes are black ;&nbsp;the irides yellow ; they have four toes before and five&nbsp;behind ; at the end of each toe there ia a round membrane, concave beneath, and not unlike the mouth of a&nbsp;leech. They lurk under the lower fides of leaves, even&nbsp;of the talleſt trees, and adhere firmly, by means of the&nbsp;membranes at the ends of their toes, {ticking to the&nbsp;ſmootheſt ſurface t a looking-glaſs was held before one,.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
