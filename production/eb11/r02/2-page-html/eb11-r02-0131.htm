<p><span class="font0">ducts, or vestigial representatives of the vasa efferentia, are often of considerable length, persistent in chameleon and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uromastix,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">much reduced in geckos, or disappearing with age as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The urine of most lizards contains much solid uric acid, which&nbsp;is retained in the urodaeum and voided as a rather solid, white&nbsp;mass, not united with the faeces. Those which have a greater&nbsp;amount of fluid urine have a bladder which receives the fluid&nbsp;portion. The opening of this bladder is on the ventral side of the&nbsp;cloaca, not in direct connexion with the ureters. The bladder&nbsp;is very rarely absent, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in Varanidae and Amphisbaenidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font0"> have the kidneys placed below the pelvis; their surface shows meandering convolutions separated by furrows.&nbsp;The ureters are for the greater part of their length deeply sunk&nbsp;into the substance of the kidneys, which they leave near the&nbsp;hinder ends, to run freely for a short distance along the dorsal&nbsp;sides of the cloaca, and they open, each separately, and away&nbsp;from the vasa deferentia, into the dorsal side of the urodaeum,&nbsp;which, together with the coprodaeum, forms a large oval chamber,&nbsp;and this being filled with the very fluid urine, functionizes instead&nbsp;of the absent bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font0"> the kidneys lie in the pelvis, short and thick, more or less trihedral; the surface is marked with many shallow&nbsp;meandering grooves and fewer deeper furrows. Each ureter,&nbsp;composed of several large successive canals, leaves its kidney&nbsp;near the inner hinder end, and then runs free for a short space,&nbsp;crossing the gut to open into the neck of the urinary bladder,&nbsp;which arises ventrally out of the urodaeum, which itself has&nbsp;become a recess of the cloaca. The bladder is large, often more&nbsp;or less two-horned, attached to the pelvic wall by a peritoneal&nbsp;fold, and it contains very fluid urine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The kidneys of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> are very small and far removed from the generative organs. The ureters open, each close to&nbsp;the vas deferens of its side, beneath a little papilla, on the dorsal&nbsp;side, rather near the midline of the urodaeum, whence arises&nbsp;a long-necked bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reproductive System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ovaries</span><span class="font0"> are always in pairs, placed headwards at a distance from the kidneys in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenadon,</span><span class="font0"> lizards and snakes; in the&nbsp;latter the right ovary lies farther forward. In tortoises, and&nbsp;especially in the crocodiles, where they arc very long and much&nbsp;twisted or Iobated, they are situated close to the kidneys and&nbsp;even accompany them. The ovaries of lizards and snakes contain many and large lymph spaces; those of the other reptiles&nbsp;are much denser in structure. The ripening eggs always cause&nbsp;them to assume the shape of a bunch of grapes. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oviducts</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;each held by a peritoneal fold which arises from near the dorsal&nbsp;midline. The abdominal ostia are long slits and are turned&nbsp;towards the side, away from the ovaries. The walls of the ducts&nbsp;gradually become thicker, glandular and much folded. Whilst&nbsp;the ripe eggs, often in considerable numbers, receive their shell,&nbsp;each egg lies in a separate chamber; in the geckos, which lay&nbsp;only one pair of eggs, the two respective chambers have become&nbsp;permanent features. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> each oviduct opens together&nbsp;with the ureter of its side near the dorsomedian line of the&nbsp;urodaeum. In most lizards the two oviducts and the two&nbsp;ureters have four separate openings in the dorsal wall of the&nbsp;rather deep dorsal recess of the urodaeum. But in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lophura&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">both oviducts unite (like the ureters) and have only one opening,&nbsp;which is placed a little nearer towards the pelvis than the&nbsp;urinary opening, but they are divided by a longitudinal septum&nbsp;which extends almost to their common orifice. In the snakes&nbsp;the oviducts likewise open into the dorsal recess, sometimes by a&nbsp;common ostium, which is provided with a strong sphincter. The&nbsp;whole recess acts like a vagina for the reception of one of-the&nbsp;copulatory organs. The oviducts of the crocodiles open in a&nbsp;decidedly ventral position, on either side close to the base of the&nbsp;clitoris, a considerable distance from the openings of the ureters.&nbsp;In the tortoises the oviducts open separately into a wide ventral&nbsp;urino-genital sinus, at the base of the neck of the bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testes</span><span class="font0"> correspond in position with the ovaries; in snakes and Amphisbaenids the right is placed farther headwards than the left. The usual shape is elongated, sometimes&nbsp;pointed forwards. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epididymis</span><span class="font0"> is sometimes of the same&nbsp;size as the testis and then consists of many meandering convolutions of the vas defercns which is composed of several&nbsp;canals from thc testis. The convolutions are held together by a&nbsp;peritoneal lamella. Towards thc cloaca they become much&nbsp;smaller and shorter, and the vas deferens passes along the median&nbsp;side of the ureter. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> these open separately, each&nbsp;near and below the same papilla near which opens the ureter of&nbsp;the same side. In most lizards the vas deferens unites with its&nbsp;ureter into one short canal which opens beneath or upon a small&nbsp;papilla in the upper corner of the urodaeal recess, far away from&nbsp;the penis. In snakes vas deferens and ureter of each side are&nbsp;likewise commonly united. In the crocodiles each vas dcferens&nbsp;passes from the dorsal side of the cloaca to the ventral side, not&nbsp;accompanied by the ureter, and opens into the blind sac which&nbsp;forms the basal continuation of the deep groove on the dorsal&nbsp;side of the penis. In the tortoises the epididymis is very large&nbsp;and the vas deferens is also much convoluted; each opens&nbsp;separately near the neck of the large urinary bladder close to&nbsp;the backward continuation of the deep longitudinal groove of&nbsp;the copulatory organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remnants of the Mullerian ducts run paralleI with the vasa deferentia, and similar remnants of the Wolffian ducts accompany&nbsp;the oviducts in crocodiles and tortoises, least degenerated of&nbsp;course in young specimens. Such reciprocal vestiges occur&nbsp;most likely also in lizards, and in female snakes a.vestige of the&nbsp;male duct joins its ureter. In a nearly adult male </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;present writer missed the female remnants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The copulatory organs show’ very important modifications. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> is the only recent reptile which is devoid of such an&nbsp;organ; its imperfect substitute is an unpaired, thin, but high&nbsp;membranous fold which arises from the dorsal middle of the&nbsp;circular fold between urodaeum and coprodaeum. During&nbsp;copulation this part of the cloaca is probably everted to secure&nbsp;conception, a striking resemblance to the arrangement found&nbsp;in the Caecilia. The organs of all lizards and snakes are paired,&nbsp;in their quiescent state withdrawn into deep pockets which&nbsp;open on the right and left posterior comers of the proctodaeum&nbsp;or outer chamber of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cloaca, which for this reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">has assumed the shape of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a transverse slit in all</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lizards and snakes. Hence</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">these have sometimes been</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plagiotremota.</span><span class="font0"> Each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">organ can be everted and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tucked in like the finger</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of a glove, a muscle being</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">attached, to the inside of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the apex; when everted, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">muscle extends through the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">length of the organ; each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">muscle arises from the ven</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tral side of several trans</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">verse processes of the tail</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">vertebrae, at a consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">able distance from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cloaca. In the embryo each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">organ arises as a conical protuberance, or papilla, which projects out of the vent. Later it becomes inverted. Probably this ontogenetic feature recapitulates the phylogeny&nbsp;of these organs, which have to be looked upon as swelling flaps or portions of the walls of the cloaca which were protruded during copulation, and which in time borrowed, and&nbsp;specialized, muscular fibres from the ventral tail muscles. On&nbsp;the outer everted side of each organ is a furrow for the reception&nbsp;of the semen. The apex is either single or more or lcss deeply&nbsp;bifurcated, each arm being followed by the likewise divided&nbsp;furrow.. The outer investing membrane of these.very muscular&nbsp;erectile bodies is epidermal; often, especially in snakes, provided with numerous papillae, folds or other excrescences.
