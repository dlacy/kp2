        <p><span class="font1">It is also stated by Dionysius that under Servius Tullius various

                comitia of the curies.<sup>@@3</sup> But we have no&nbsp;corroboration of this, and

        <p><span class="font1">ii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reforms of
                Servius Tullius.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is generally agreed that towards the end of the regal period, and
                connected with the king traditionally called Servius&nbsp;Tullius, a great reform of
                the constitution took place, which&nbsp;exercised much influence on the subsequent
                development of&nbsp;the law. No doubt there is a good deal of myth attached
                to&nbsp;the name of Servius, who seems to have been regarded by later&nbsp;Romans as
                a popular monarch, like Alfred by the English, but&nbsp;the main features of the
                traditional account of the constitutional&nbsp;reforms of this period may be taken
                as based on fair presumptive&nbsp;evidence. That all of them indeed were evolved
                from one&nbsp;brain is hardly credible, and that some of them were in observance
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span
                class="font1"> before being made constitutionally binding is&nbsp;very
                likely.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The design attributed to Servius was that of altering the old
                constitution in order to promote an advance tovzards equality&nbsp;between
                patricians and plebeians. He is credited with having&nbsp;desired, on the one hand,
                to ameliorate the position of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> and, on the other, to
                make them bear a proportionate&nbsp;share of the burdens of the state—in particular,
                to serve in&nbsp;the army and contribute to the war tax </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">{tributum).</span><span class="font1"> He
                effected&nbsp;this by giving them qualified rights of citizenship, not
                indeed&nbsp;by admitting them into the gentile organizations, but by creating a new
                political assembly of a distinctly military character&nbsp;in which they as well as
                the gentiles could take part. The&nbsp;so-called Servian reforms may be roughly
                summarized under&nbsp;the following four heads, viz. (i) a division of the
                Roman&nbsp;territory within the city walls into four local wards
                called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tribus</span><span
                class="font1"> (to which a number of tribes outside the city—</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tribus&nbsp;rusticae—</span><span
                class="font1">were afterwards in course of time added); (2) the&nbsp;establishment
                of a register of the citizens </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >{census)</span><span class="font1"> which was&nbsp;to contain, in addition to a
                record of the strength of their&nbsp;families, a statement of the value of their
                lands, with the slaves&nbsp;and cattle employed in their cultivation, and which was
                to be&nbsp;revised periodically; (3) a division of the people, as appearing&nbsp;in
                the census, into five classes for military purposes, determined&nbsp;by the value of
                their holdings in land and its appurtenances,&nbsp;with a subdivision of each class
                into so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >centuriae;</span><span class="font1"> (4) the&nbsp;creation of a new assembly with

                >centuriae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">While it may be an open question how far
                these reforms, and&nbsp;particularly the institution of the centuriate comitia,
                were&nbsp;actually due to Servius, or only a result of his arrangements,&nbsp;the
                whole conception of the new constitution is obviously of&nbsp;early date and
                indicative of considerable statesmanship.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The plebeians were thereby made constitutionally part of the

                tribute he was to pay, and his right to take part in the new&nbsp;political
                assembly. It is indeed probable that a good while&nbsp;before Servius the conception
                of individual ownership of lands&nbsp;and things necessary for their cultivation had
                been reached,&nbsp;and that such ownership was recognized not only among
