<p><span class="font2">notice at Rome. The popes of the Renaissance were profoundly uninterested in theology; they were far more at home in an&nbsp;art gallery, or in fighting to recover their influence as temporal&nbsp;Italian princes, gravely shattered during the long residence of&nbsp;the papal court at Avignon in the 14th century. But these&nbsp;secular interests came to an end with the so-called sack of&nbsp;Rome in 1527, when Charles V. turned his arms against Clement&nbsp;VII., and made the pope a prisoner in his own capital. Thenceforward there was no more thought of territorial aggrandisement. The popes, as the phrase went, became Spanish chaplains, with a fixed territory guaranteed to them by Spanish&nbsp;arms; apart from the addition of Ferrara and one or two other&nbsp;petty principalities on the extinction of the reigning house, its&nbsp;boundaries remained unchanged till Napoleonic times. Under&nbsp;Clement’s successor, Paul III., a new state of things began to&nbsp;dawn. Hitherto the way had been blocked by a horde of&nbsp;protonotaries, dataries and other officials—purveyors of indulgences, dispensations and such-like spiritual favours—to&nbsp;whom reform spelt ruin. Even the Reformation did not move&nbsp;them; if less money came in from Germany, that was all the&nbsp;more reason for leaving things unchanged in France and Spain.&nbsp;But among Paul’s cardinals were three remarkable men, the&nbsp;Italians Contarini and Sadolet, and the Englishman Reginald&nbsp;Pole, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury under Mary. All&nbsp;three were disciples of Erasmus, the great apostle of a new,&nbsp;tolerant, scholarly religion very different from the grimy pedantry&nbsp;of the medieval doctors. It was better, he said, to be weak in&nbsp;Duns Scotus, but strong in St Paul—than to be crammed with&nbsp;all the learning of Durandus, and ignorant of the law of Christ.&nbsp;Men trained in this school were not likely to be tender towards&nbsp;vested interests in darkness, least of all when they stood in the&nbsp;way of a reconciliation with the Protestants: for the cardinals&nbsp;thought that the strength of the Reformation lay much less in&nbsp;the attractiveness of Luther’s doctrines than in his vigorous&nbsp;denunciations of the vices of the clergy. Once root out abuses&nbsp;with a firm hand, and they believed that a few timely concessions on points of doctrine would tempt most Protestants&nbsp;back within the Roman pale. This belief was shared by&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles V. Together they persuaded the unwilling</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Council</span><span class="font2"> pope to call a general council. It met in December </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of Trent.</span><span class="font2"> J<sub>545</sub>, <sub>at</sub> TjIesc city of Trent, with Pole as one of&nbsp;the three presidents (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Trent, Council of).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a means of reconciliation the council was a signal failure. The Protestants refused to attend an assembly where even&nbsp;the most conciliatory prelate could hardly condescend to&nbsp;meet them on equal terms. Nor was Pole allowed to use the&nbsp;only possible means of overcoming their reluctance. He had&nbsp;wished to begin by reforming abuses before proceeding to&nbsp;sit in judgment on doctrinal errors. But this arrangement&nbsp;was cried down as a revolutionary departure from all established&nbsp;precedent; and he had much ado to secure the compromise&nbsp;that doctrines and practical reforms should be simultaneously&nbsp;discussed. But in the midst of its labours the council was&nbsp;prorogued (March 1547) in consequence of a quarrel between&nbsp;the pope and emperor. In 1551 it met again, only to be again&nbsp;prorogued in 1552. Ten years later it met again for a third&nbsp;and final session, lasting throughout 1562 and 1563. During&nbsp;those ten years great changes had taken place. Charles V. had&nbsp;followed Pole and his peace-loving colleagues to the grave;&nbsp;in his place stood his son, Philip II. of Spain, while the intellectual leadership of the council fell to Jaime Laynez, general&nbsp;of the newly founded Society of Jesus. There was no longer&nbsp;any question of * reconciliation with the Protestants. North&nbsp;Germany, England, Scandinavia were irretrievably lost to&nbsp;Rome; wars of religion had broken out in France. Clearly&nbsp;the one hope was to enter into a desperate struggle for the&nbsp;possession of such countries as still hung in the balance; and&nbsp;that could· best be done by striking at the heart of the Reformation. Protestantism centred—or was by Catholics supposed&nbsp;to centre—in a mysterious “right of private judgment”;&nbsp;the council accordingly retorted by hymning the praises of&nbsp;obedience, of submitting to authority and never thinking for&nbsp;oneself. To waverers it held up an absolutely sure and uniform&nbsp;Rule of Faith, contrasting impressively with the already multitudinous variations of the Protestant Churches. Moreover,&nbsp;thanks to Layncz, it accomplished this task without running&nbsp;the obvious danger of tying itself hand and foot to the past.&nbsp;When old-fashioned theologians talked about the canons and&nbsp;.councils of antiquity, Laynez answered that the Church was&nbsp;not more infallible at one time than another; the Holy Ghost&nbsp;spoke through the decrees of Trent quite as plainly and directly&nbsp;as through the primitive Father^. Thus the council’s authority&nbsp;became at once peremptory and elastic. But the real gainer&nbsp;was the pope. Hitherto infallibility had been thought of as the&nbsp;supreme weapon of the Church’s armoury, destined only for&nbsp;use at some extraordinary crisis; hence it was naturally conceived of as residing only in the extraordinary authority&nbsp;of a general council presided over by the pope. Since the&nbsp;outbreak of the Reformation, however, extraordinary crises,&nbsp;calling for immediate decision, might arise at any moment.&nbsp;It was no longer possible to wait for the assembling of a&nbsp;general council; stronger and stronger grew the tendency&nbsp;to ascribe infallibility to the pope alone, as being always on&nbsp;the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Doctrine and discipline once settled at Trent, the work of counter-reformation could begin. Rebels were won back&nbsp;by force wherever force could be applied. In Spain&nbsp;the Inquisition soon snuffed out the few Reformers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Italy, though declared Protestants were few, there was widespread sympathy with some of Luther’s&nbsp;ideas; a committee of cardinals at Rome was accordingly&nbsp;orgamzed into an Inquisition, with branches at the chief Italian&nbsp;towns. For half a century trials were many at Venice and&nbsp;elsewhere, but actual executions were only common at Rome;&nbsp;the most illustrious victim was the philosopher Giordano Biuno,&nbsp;burnt in 1600. In the imperial dominions, however, there could&nbsp;be no recourse to the stake. The peace of Augsburg (1555)&nbsp;forbade the German princes to persecute, though it recognized&nbsp;their right to determine to what religion their subjects should&nbsp;belong, and to banish nonconformists. At first this compromise had worked in .favour of the Reformation, but presently&nbsp;the CathoHc princes began to turn it against their Protestant&nbsp;subjects. “ Governments learned to oppress them wisely,&nbsp;depriving them of church and school, of pastor and schoolmaster; and by those nameless arts with which the rich used&nbsp;to coerce the poor in the good old days. Fervent preachers&nbsp;came amongst them, widely differing in moraUty, education,&nbsp;earnestness and eloquence from the parish clergy, whose deficiencies gave such succour to Luther. Most<sub>i</sub> of those who,&nbsp;having no taste for controversy, were repelled by scandals&nbsp;were easily reconciled. Others, who were conscious of disagreement with the theology of the last thousand years, had&nbsp;now to meet disputants of a more serious type than the&nbsp;adversaries of Luther, and to meet them unsupported by&nbsp;experts of their own. Therefore it was by honest conviction,&nbsp;as well as by calculated but not illegal coercion, that the&nbsp;Reformation was driven back ” (Acton, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on Modern&nbsp;History,</span><span class="font2"> p. 123).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This system was not ân unmixed success; for its extension to Bohemia early in the 17th century brought about the Thirty&nbsp;Years’ War. But it obliged the authorities to pay anew attention to the training of the clergy. The “ seminary system ”&nbsp;came into being—that is, the custom of obHging candidates&nbsp;for ordination to spend several years in a theological college,&nbsp;whence lay influences were carefully excluded. But ecclesiastical learning of a wider type was also promoted. Gregory&nbsp;XIII. (1572-85) and Sixtus V. (1585-90) dreamed of making&nbsp;Rome once more the capital of European culture. Gregory reformed the Calendar, and founded the university that bears his&nbsp;name. Five years of power were enough for Sixtus to reform&nbsp;the central government of the Church and the administration&nbsp;of the Papal States, to set on foot the Vatican press and issue&nbsp;an official edition of the Vulgate. Thcir efforts bore fruit in&nbsp;many quarters. In Rome arose Cardinal Baronius, first </span><span class="font1">of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
