<p><span class="font1">Hagiographa, is usually reckoned as the second of the five Megilloth or Festal Rolls. This position corresponds to&nbsp;the Jewish practice of reading the book at the Feast of&nbsp;Pentecost ; Spanish MSS., however, place Ruth at the&nbsp;head of the Megilloth (see Canticles) ; and the Talmud,&nbsp;in a well-known passage of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Bathra,</span><span class="font1"> gives it the&nbsp;first place among all the Hagiographa. On the other&nbsp;hand the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the English version&nbsp;make Ruth follow Judges. It has sometimes been held&nbsp;that this was its original place in the Hebrew Bible also,&nbsp;or rather that Ruth was originally reckoned as an appendix to Judges, since it is only by doing this, and also by&nbsp;reckoning Lamentations to Jeremiah, that all the books of&nbsp;the Hebrew canon can be reduced to twenty-two, the&nbsp;number assigned by Josephus and other ancient authorities. But it has been shown in the article Lamentations&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> that the argument for the superior antiquity of this&nbsp;way of reckoning breaks down on closer examination, and,&nbsp;while it was very natural that a later rearrangement&nbsp;should transfer Ruth from the Hagiographa to the historical books, and place it between Judges and Samuel, no&nbsp;motive can be suggested for the opposite change. That&nbsp;the book of Ruth did not originally form part of the series&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prophetæ priores</span><span class="font1"> (Judges-Kings) is further probable&nbsp;from the fact that it is quite untouched by the process of&nbsp;“ prophetic ” or “ Deuteronomistic ” editing, which gave&nbsp;that series its present shape at a time soon after the fall&nbsp;of the kingdom of Judah; the narrative has no affinity&nbsp;with the point of view which looks on the whole history&nbsp;of Israel as a series of examples of divine justice and&nbsp;mercy in the successive rebellions and repentances of the&nbsp;people of God. @@<sup>1</sup> But if the book had been known at the&nbsp;time when the history from Judges to Kings was edited,&nbsp;it could hardly have been excluded from the collection ;&nbsp;the ancestry of David was of greater interest than that of&nbsp;Saul, which is given in 1 Sam. ix. 1, whereas the old&nbsp;history names no ancestor of David beyond his father&nbsp;Jesse. In truth the book of Ruth does not offer itself as&nbsp;a document written soon after the period to which it&nbsp;refers ; it presents itself as dealing with times far back&nbsp;(Ruth i. 1), and takes obvious delight in depicting details&nbsp;of antique life and obsolete usages ; it views the rude&nbsp;and stormy period before the institution of the kingship&nbsp;through the softening atmosphere of time, which imparts&nbsp;to the scene a gentle sweetness very different from the&nbsp;harsher colours of the old narratives of the book of&nbsp;Judges. In the language, too, there is a good deal that&nbsp;makes for and nothing that makes against a date subsequent to the captivity, and the very designation of a&nbsp;period of Hebrew history as “ the days of the judges ” is&nbsp;based on the Deuteronomistic additions to the book of&nbsp;Judges (ii. 16 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)</span><span class="font1"> and does not occur till the period of&nbsp;the exile. An inferior limit for the date of the book&nbsp;cannot be assigned with precision. It has been argued&nbsp;that, as the author seems to take no offence at the marriage&nbsp;of Israelites with Moabite women, he must have lived&nbsp;before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezra ix. ; Neh.&nbsp;xiii.) ; but the same argument would prove that the book&nbsp;of Esther was written before Ezra, and indeed “ a disposition to derive prominent Jewish families from proselytes&nbsp;prevailed to a much later date,” and finds expression in&nbsp;the Talmud (see Wellhausen-Bleek, p. 205). The language of Ruth, however, though post-classical, does not&nbsp;seem to place it among the very latest Old Testament&nbsp;books, and the manner in which the story is told is as&nbsp;remote from the legal pragmatism of Chronicles as from&nbsp;the prophetic pragmatism of the editor of the older&nbsp;histories. The tone of simple piety and graciousness&nbsp;which runs through the narrative, unencumbered by the&nbsp;pedantry of Jewish legality, seems to indicate that the&nbsp;book was written before all the living impulses of Jewish&nbsp;literature were choked by the growing influence of the&nbsp;doctors of the law. In this respect it holds in Hebrew&nbsp;prose writing a position analogous to that of the older&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chokma</span><span class="font1"> in Hebrew poetry. But the triumph of the scribes&nbsp;in literature as well as in law was not accomplished till&nbsp;long after the time of Ezra.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The religious pragmatism lacking in the original is in part supplied by the Targum (i. 5, 6).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Wellhausen in Bleek, 4th edition, p. 204 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.,</span><span class="font1"> finds the clearest indication of the date of Ruth in the appended&nbsp;genealogy, Ruth iv. 18-22 ; compare his remarks in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prol. GescK Israels,</span><span class="font1"> p. 227 (Eng. tr., pp. 217 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.).</span><span class="font1"> Salma&nbsp;(Salmon), father of Boaz, is a tribe foreign to old Judah,&nbsp;which was not “ father ” of Bethlehem till after the exile,&nbsp;and the names of Salma’s ancestors are also open to criticism. But this genealogy is also found in Chronicles,&nbsp;and is quite in the manner of other genealogies in the&nbsp;same book. That it was borrowed from Chronicles and&nbsp;added to Ruth by a later hand seems 'certain, for the&nbsp;author of Ruth clearly recognizes that Obed was legally&nbsp;the son of Mahlon, not of Boaz (iv. 5, 10), so that from&nbsp;his standpoint the appended genealogy is all wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The design of the book of Ruth has been much discussed and often in too narrow a spirit ; for the author is an artist who takes manifest delight in the touching and&nbsp;graceful details of his picture, and is not simply guided&nbsp;by a design to impart historical information about David’s&nbsp;ancestors, or enforce some particular lesson. Now the&nbsp;interest of the story, as a work of art, culminates in the&nbsp;marriage of Boaz and Ruth, not in the fact that their son&nbsp;was David’s ancestor, which, if the book originally ended&nbsp;with iv. 17, is only mentioned in a cursory way at the&nbsp;close of the story. Had the author’s main design been to&nbsp;illustrate the history of the house of David, as many&nbsp;critics think, or to make the point that the noblest stock&nbsp;in Israel was sprung from an alien mother (Wellhausen),&nbsp;this design would certainly have been brought into more&nbsp;prominence. The marriage acquires an additional interest&nbsp;when we know that Ruth was David’s great-grandmother,&nbsp;but the main interest is independent of that, and lies in&nbsp;the happy issue of Ruth and Naomi from their troubles&nbsp;through the loyal performance of the kinsman’s part by&nbsp;Boaz. Doubtless the writer meant his story to be an&nbsp;example to his own age, as well as an interesting sketch&nbsp;of the past ; but this is effected simply by describing the&nbsp;exemplary conduct of Naomi, Ruth, Boaz, and even Boaz’s&nbsp;harvesters. All these act as simple, kindly, God-fearing&nbsp;people ought to act in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is one antique custom which the writer follows with peculiar interest and describes with archæological detail as a thing&nbsp;which had evidently gone out of use in his own day. By old&nbsp;Hebrew law, as by the old law of Arabia, a wife who had been&nbsp;brought into her husband’s house by contract and payment of a&nbsp;price to her father was not set free by the death of her husband&nbsp;to marry again at will. The right to her hand lay with the&nbsp;nearest heir of the dead. Originally we must suppose, among the&nbsp;Hebrews as among the Arabs, this law was all to the disadvantage&nbsp;of the widow, whose hand was simply part of the dead man’s&nbsp;estate ; but, while this remained so in Arabia to the time of&nbsp;Mohammed, among the Hebrews the law early took quite an&nbsp;opposite turn ; the widow of a man who died childless was held&nbsp;to have a right to have a son begotten on her by the next&nbsp;kinsman, and this son was regarded as the sou of the dead and&nbsp;succeeded to his inheritance so that his name might not be cut&nbsp;off from Israel. The duty of raising up a son to the dead lay upon&nbsp;his brother, and in Deut. xxv. 5 is restricted to the case when&nbsp;brothers live together. In old times, as appears from Gen. xxxviii.,&nbsp;this was not so, and the law as put in the book of Ruth appears&nbsp;to be that the nearest kinsman of the dead in general had a&nbsp;right to “redeem for himself” the dead man’s estate, but at the&nbsp;same time was bound to marry the widow. The son of this&nbsp;marriage was reckoned as the dead man’s son and succeeded to&nbsp;his property, so that the “ redeemer ” had only a temporary&nbsp;usufruct in it. Naomi was too old to be married in this way, but</span></p>
