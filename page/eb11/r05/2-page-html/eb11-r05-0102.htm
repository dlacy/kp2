<p><span class="font0">formed of English exiles in the French army, and received a wound at the siege of La Bassée in 1647. Charles in misfortune&nbsp;had understood something of his nephew’s devotion, and wrote&nbsp;to him in the friendliest terms, and though the prince had by&nbsp;no means forgiven Digby, Colepeper and others of the council,&nbsp;he obtained command of a Royalist fleet. The king’s enemies&nbsp;were now no longer the Fresbyterians and the majority of the&nbsp;English people but the stern Independent community, with&nbsp;whose aims and aspirations he could not have any sympathy&nbsp;whatever. A long and unprofitable naval campaign followed,&nbsp;which extended from Kinsale to Lisbon and from Toulon to&nbsp;Cape Verde. But the prince again quarrelled with the council,&nbsp;and spent six years (1654-60) in Germany, during which&nbsp;period nothing is known of him, except that he vainly attempted&nbsp;(as also before and afterwards) to obtain the apanage to which&nbsp;as a younger son he was entitled from his brother the elector&nbsp;palatine. At the Restoration he settled in England again,&nbsp;receiving from Charles II. an annuity and becoming a member&nbsp;of the privy council. He never again fought on land, but,&nbsp;turning admiral like Blake and Monk, he bore a brilliant part&nbsp;in the Dutch Wars. He died at his house in Spring Gardens,&nbsp;Westminster, on the 29th of November 1682.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Apart from his military renown, Prince Rupert is a distinguished figure in the history of art as one of the earliest mezzotinters. It has often been said that he was the inventor&nbsp;of mezzotint engraving, but this is erroneous, as he obtained&nbsp;the secret from a German officer, Ludwig von Siegen. One of&nbsp;the most beautiful and valuable of early mezzotints is his “ Head&nbsp;of St John the Baptist.” He was also interested in science,&nbsp;experimented with the manufacture of gunpowder, the boring&nbsp;of guns and the casting of shot, and invented a modified brass&nbsp;called “ prince’s metal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prince Rupert was duke of Cumberland and earl of Holder-ness in the English peerage. He was unmarried, but left two natural children; one a daughter who married General Emmanuel&nbsp;Scrope Howe and died in 1740, and the other a son, whose&nbsp;mother (who claimed that she was married to the prince) was&nbsp;Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Bard, Viscount Bellamont.&nbsp;The son was killed in 1686 at the siege of Buda.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUPERT (1352-1410), German king, and, as Rupert III., elector palatine of the Rhine, was a son of the elector Rupert&nbsp;II. and Beatrice, daughter of Peter II., king of Sicily. He was&nbsp;born at Amberg on the 5th of May 1352, and from his early&nbsp;years took part in the government of the Palatinate to which&nbsp;he succeeded on his father’s death in 1398. He was one of the&nbsp;four electors who met at Oberlahnstein in August 1400 and declared King Wenceslaus deposed. This was followed by the&nbsp;election of Rupert as German king at Rense on the 21st of that&nbsp;month, and by his coronation at Cologne on the 6th of the&nbsp;following January. Winning some recognition in S. Germany,&nbsp;he made an expedition to Italy, where he hoped to receive the&nbsp;imperial crown, and to crush Gian Galleazzo Visconti, duke of&nbsp;Milan. In the autumn of 1401 he crossed the Alps, but his&nbsp;troops, checked before Brescia, melted away, and in 1402&nbsp;Rupert, too poor to continue the campaign, returned to Germany. The news of this failure increased the disorder in&nbsp;Germany, but the king met with some success in his efforts to&nbsp;restore peace, and in October 1403 he was recognized by Pope&nbsp;Boniface IX. It was only the indolence of Wenceslaus that&nbsp;prevented his overthrow, and in 1406 he was compelled to make&nbsp;certain concessions. The quarrel was complicated by the papal&nbsp;schism, but the king was just beginning to make some headway&nbsp;when he died at his castle of Landskron near Oppenheim on the&nbsp;18th of May 1410 and was buried at Heidelberg. He married&nbsp;Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick IV. of Hohenzollem, burgrave&nbsp;of Nuremburg, and left three sons and four daughters. Rupert,&nbsp;who earned the surname of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">clemens,</span><span class="font0"> was brave and generous,&nbsp;but his resources were totally inadequate to bear the strain of&nbsp;the German kingship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUPERT’S LAND, a former district of Canada. The generous charter of Charles II. given in 1670 to the Hudson's Bay Company gave rights of possession, trade and administration of&nbsp;justice “ of all those seas, streights and bays, rivers, lakes,&nbsp;creeks and sounds, in whatsoever latitude they shall be, that lie&nbsp;within the entrance of the streights commonly called Hudson’s&nbsp;streights, together with all the lands, countries and territories&nbsp;upon the coasts and confines of the seas, streights, bays, lakes,&nbsp;rivers, creeks and sounds aforesaid, which are not now actually&nbsp;possessed by any of our subjects, or by the subjects of any other&nbsp;Christian prince or state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general interpretation given to this was that it included all the country drained into Hudson Bay. As Prince Rupert&nbsp;was first governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company his name was&nbsp;given to the concession under the name “ Rupert’s Land.” It&nbsp;will be observed that Athabasca, New Caledonia and British&nbsp;Columbia were not included in this grant. They were held under&nbsp;the title Indian Territories by the Hudson’s Bay Company by&nbsp;licence terminable every twenty-one years, the last term closing&nbsp;with 1859. Rupert’s Land was transferred to Canada by the&nbsp;imperial government in 1870, and ceased to exist as a political&nbsp;name. It is still used as the title of the episcopal diocese, which&nbsp;is in the main coincident with the province of Manitoba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUPILIUS, PUBLIUS, Roman statesman, consul in 132 B.c. During the inquiry that followed the death of Tiberius Gracchus,&nbsp;conducted by himself and his colleague Popillius Laenas, he&nbsp;proceeded with the utmost severity against the supporters of&nbsp;Gracchus. In the same year he was despatched to Sicily, where&nbsp;he suppressed the revolt of the slaves under Eunus. During&nbsp;131 he remained as proconsul of the island, and, with the&nbsp;assistance of ten commissioners appointed by the senate, drew&nbsp;up regulations for the organization of Sicily as a province.&nbsp;These regulations were known by the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges Rupiliae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">though they were not laws in the strict sense. Rupilius was&nbsp;subsequently brought to trial (123 b.c.) and condemned for&nbsp;his treatment of the friends of Gracchus. The disgrace of his&nbsp;condemnation, added to disappointment at the failure of his&nbsp;brother to obtain the consulship in spite of the efforts of Scipio,&nbsp;caused his death shortly afterwards.</span></p>

The town, which was rebuilt in fine, regular fashion&nbsp;after a destructive fire in 1787, contains three Protestant&nbsp;churches, a Roman Catholic church and various educational&nbsp;and benevolent institutions. Its inhabitants are employed in&nbsp;the manufacture of cloth, starch and machinery, in ironfounding and lithography. Important cattle and horse fairs&nbsp;are held here.

It was&nbsp;one of the twelve cities of the Etruscan confederation, and was&nbsp;taken in 294 B.C. by the Romans. In 205 B.C. it contributed&nbsp;grain and timber for the needs of Scipio’s fleet. A colony was&nbsp;founded here either by the Triumviri or by Augustus. The&nbsp;place was deserted in 1138, and the episcopal see was transferred</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
