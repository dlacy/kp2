He was made rector of that university in 1873. In 1874 and 1875 he was the official reporter of the memorable Reunion Conferences held at Bonn in those years and attended by many distinguished theologians of the Oriental and Anglican communions.</p><p>Reusch was a profound scholar, an untiring worker and a man of lovable character. Among his voluminous works were contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Revue internationale de théologie,</hi> a review started at Bern at the instance of the Old Catholic Congress at Lucerne. He wrote also works on the Old Testament; a pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Die Deutschen Bischöfe und der Aberglaube;</hi> and another on the falsifications to be found in the treatise of Aquinas against the Greeks; as well as essays on the history of the Jesuit Order, and a book of prayers. But his fame will mainly rest on the works which he and Dollinger published jointly. These consisted of a work on the Autobiography of Cardinal Bellarmine, the <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Moralstreitigen in der Römisch-Katholischen Kirche seit dem XVI. Jahrhundert,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Erörterungen über Leben und Schriften des hl. Liguori.</hi> During the last few years of his life he was smitten with paralysis. He died on the 3rd of March 1900, leaving behind him in manuscript a collection of letters to Bunsen about Roman cardinals and prelates, which has since been published. (J. J. L. *)</p>
