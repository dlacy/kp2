in area the sixth (789 square miles), in actual population the fourth (210,491), and in relative density of population the tenth of the Swiss cantons, was formed in 1803 out of the two independent communities of the “ town ” and the “ abbey ” (including Toggenburg), Rapperswyl, Uznach, Gaster, Sargans, Gams, Rheinthal, Sax (with Forsteck), which belonged to Zurich, and Werdenberg, which belonged to Glarus. It encloses the canton<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0187.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0169"/>
of Appenzell, extending between the Lake of Constance and the Lake of Zurich on the west, and being bounded by the Rhine on the east, while in the south-west lies the valley occupied by the Wallenstätt Lake and the Linth Canal. The Rhine separates St Gall from Tyrol, and the rest of its frontier is conterminous in succession with Grisons, Glarus, Schwyz, Zurich, and Thurgau. In altitude the canton ranges from 1306 feet above the sea (the height of the Lake of Constance) to 10,660 feet in the Ringelspitz of the Sardona group. The arable area is not sufficient to supply the local demand for grain; but the stock-breeding and especially the manufacturing industries, to which a large part of the population is devoted, make up for any agricultural deficiency. Rorschach and Rapperswyl are lake ports; Wyl, Lichtensteig, Altstätten, and Uznach markets of some importance for local products. Ironstone is worked in the Gonzen district, and there are quarries at Rorschach and Bolligen, Mels and Degersheim. Ragatz, the well-known watering-place, is supplied with mineral water from Pfäffers. The people of St Gall are three-fifths Roman Catholic and two-fifths Protestant (126,164 and 83,441 in 1880), but, in spite of this and considerable diversities of culture and character from district to district, a fair degree of harmony has ultimately been secured even in the treatment of educational questions. The constitution dates from 1861 and was partially revised in 1875. After being abolished for many years, the death-penalty was re-enacted in 1882. Besides the city of St Gall there were in the canton in 1880 three communes with upwards of 5000 inhabitants each,—Tablat (8092), Wattwyl (a seat of the cotton manufacture, 5283), and Straubenzell (5026).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
