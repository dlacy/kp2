<p><span class="font0">It is not known with certainty what share the empress had in this event ; but it is affirmed that on the very day&nbsp;on which it happened, while the empress was beginning her&nbsp;dinner with much gaiety, an officer, supposed to be one of&nbsp;the assassins, precipitately entered the apartment with his&nbsp;hair dishevelled, his face covered with sweat and dust, his&nbsp;clothes torn, and his countenance agitated with horror and&nbsp;dismay. On entering, his eyes, sparkling and confused, met&nbsp;those of the empress. She arose in silence, and went into&nbsp;a closet, whither he followed her. A few moments afterwards she sent for Count Panin, the former governor of&nbsp;Peter, who was already appointed her minister, and, informing him that the emperor was dead, consulted him on&nbsp;the manner of announcing his death to the public. Panin&nbsp;advised her to let one night pass over, and to spread the&nbsp;news next day, as if they had received it during the night.&nbsp;This counsel being approved, the empress returned with&nbsp;the same countenance, and continued her dinner with the&nbsp;same gaiety. On the day following, when it was published&nbsp;that Peter had died of an hæmorrhoidal colic, she appeared&nbsp;bathed in tears, and proclaimed her grief by an edict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The corpse was brought to St Petersburg, there to be exposed. The face was black, and the neck excoriated.&nbsp;Notwithstanding these horrible marks, in order to assuage&nbsp;the commotions, which began to excite apprehension, and&nbsp;to prevent impostors from hereafter disturbing the empire,&nbsp;it was left three days exposed to all the people, with only&nbsp;the ornaments of a Holstein officer. The soldiers, disbanded and disarmed, mingled with the crowd, and as they beheld their sovereign, their countenances indicated a mixture of compassion, contempt, and shame. They were&nbsp;soon afterwards embarked for their country ; but, as the&nbsp;sequel of their cruel destiny, almost all of these unfortunate men perished in a storm. Some of them had saved&nbsp;themselves on the rocks adjacent to the coast ; but they&nbsp;again fell a prey to the waves, while the commandant of&nbsp;Cronstadt despatched a messenger to St Petersburg to&nbsp;know whether he might be permitted to assist them. Thus&nbsp;fell the unhappy Peter III. in 1762, in the thirty-fourth year&nbsp;of his age, after having enjoyed the imperial dignity only six&nbsp;months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On her accession, Catherine behaved with great magna-<sup>3</sup> nimity and forbearance towards those who had opposed her elevation, or were the declared friends of the deceased em-’ peror. She gave to Prince George, in exchange for his&nbsp;title of Duke of Courland, conferred on him by Peter, the&nbsp;government of Holstein. She reinstated Biren in his dukedom of Courland, received into favour Marshal Munnich,&nbsp;who had readily transferred his fidelity from the dead to&nbsp;the living, and even pardoned her rival the Countess Vo-rontzoff, and permitted her to retain the tokens of her&nbsp;lover’s munificence. She permitted Gudovitch, who was&nbsp;high in the confidence of Peter, and had incurred her particular displeasure, to retire to his native country. Perhaps the most unexpected part of her conduct towards the&nbsp;friends of Peter, was her adhering to the treaty of peace&nbsp;which that monarch had concluded with the king of Prussia six months before. The death of his inveterate enemy&nbsp;Elizabeth had relieved Frederick from a load of solicitude,&nbsp;and had extricated him from his dangerous situation. He&nbsp;now, as he thought, saw himself again involved in a war&nbsp;with the same formidable power ; but, to his great joy, he&nbsp;found that Catherine, from motives of policy, declined entering on a war at the commencement of her reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In one particular the empress showed her jealousy and her fears. She increased the vigilance with which the&nbsp;young prince Ivan was confined in the castle of Schlusselburg, from which Peter III. had expressed a resolution to&nbsp;release him. Not long after her accession, this unfortunate prince was assassinated, though whether this event&nbsp;was to be imputed to the empress or her counsellors, cannot&nbsp;be positively determined. But a manifesto published by the&nbsp;court of St Petersburg, and supposed to have been written&nbsp;by the empress herself, admitted that the prince was put&nbsp;to death by the officers of his guard, alleging that this was&nbsp;necessary, in consequence of an attempt to carry him off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Were we to offer a detailed account of the principal transactions that took place during the long reign of Catherine, we should far exceed the limits within which this&nbsp;article must be confined, and should at the same time repeat much of what has already been given under other&nbsp;heads. As the events that distinguished the life of Catherine, however, are too important to be wholly omitted, we&nbsp;shall present our readers with the following chronological&nbsp;sketch of them, referring for a more particular account to&nbsp;Tooke’s Life of Catherine II., and to the articles Catherine IL Britain, France, Poland, Prussia, Sweden,&nbsp;and Turkey, in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The year 1766 presented at St Petersburg the grandest spectacle that perhaps was ever seen in Europe. At an entertainment, which the empress chose to name a carousal, the principal nobility appeared in the most sumptuous dresses, sparkling with diamonds, and mounted on&nbsp;horses richly caparisoned, in a magnificent theatre erected&nbsp;for that purpose. Here all that has been read of the ancient jousts and tournaments was realized and exceeded in&nbsp;the presence of thousands of spectators, who seemed to vie&nbsp;with each other in the brilliancy of their appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1768, the empress composed instructions for a new code of laws for her dominions ; and the same year she&nbsp;submitted to the danger of inoculation, in order that her&nbsp;subjects, to whom the practice was unknown, might be benefited by her example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the same year a war broke out with the Ottoman Porte. The various events of this long and important conflict, which continued for seven years, must here be only&nbsp;briefly enumerated, as they will hereafter be more particularly noticed under the article Turkey. In this war our&nbsp;countryman Greig, then an admiral in the Russian service,&nbsp;highly distinguished himself by his conduct in a naval engagement with the Turks, in the harbour of Tschesme, in&nbsp;the Archipelago, in which the Turkish fleet was entirely&nbsp;defeated, and their magazines destroyed. This took place&nbsp;on the 4th of November 1772.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the beginning of the year 1769, the khan of the Crimea made an attack on the territory of Bachmut, on the river Bog, where he was several times bravely repulsed,&nbsp;with his army of Tartars and Turks, by Major-General Ro-manius and Prince Prosorofskoi. At the same time were&nbsp;fought the battles of Zekanofca and Soroca on the Dnieper, when the large magazines of the enemy were burned.&nbsp;In February the Polish Kozaks in the voyvodeship of Brac-lau put themselves under the Russian sceptre. In the same&nbsp;month the Nisovian Saparogian Kozaks gained a battle in&nbsp;the deserts of Krim. In March the Polish rebels were subdued, and their town taken, by Major-General Ismailof.&nbsp;On the 2d of April the fort of Taganrog, on the Sea of&nbsp;Azof, was taken. On the 15th the Russian army, under&nbsp;the general-in-chief Prince Galitzin, crossed the Dniester.&nbsp;On the 19th a victory was gained by Prince Galitzin near&nbsp;Chotzim. On the 2lst the Turks were defeated not far&nbsp;from Chotzim by Lieutenant-General Count Soltikof. The&nbsp;29th, an action was fought between the Russian Kalmucks&nbsp;and the Kuban Tartars, to the disadvantage of the latter.&nbsp;June the 8th, the Turks were defeated at the mouth of the&nbsp;Dnieper, near Otchakof. An action took place on the&nbsp;Dniester on the 19th, when the troops of Prince Proso-rofskoi forced the Turks to repass the river in great disorder. Chotzim was taken on the 19th of September.&nbsp;Yassy, in Moldavia, was taken on the 27th of September.&nbsp;Bukarescht, in Wallachia, was taken, and the hospodar&nbsp;made prisoner, in November 1770. A victory was gained</span></p>
