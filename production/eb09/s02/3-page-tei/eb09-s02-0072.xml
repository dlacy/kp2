At present (1886) Paris possesses by far the most important school of art existing, and French painters on the whole are supreme in power of drawing and in technical skill. Unhappily these great merits are often counterbalanced by false sentimentalism or excessive realism, and especially by gross sensuality. Art in France—that is, in Paris—is now in a state of the most prolific activity, and is branching out into new and startling phases, such as the impressionist style, in which <hi rend="italic">form</hi> is suppressed for the sake of <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> and the naturalist school, which leans rather to what is ugly or even loathsome ; to the latter belong some of the technically ablest painters alive. @@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> As in Spain and Italy, the influence of Fortuny is strong in Paris, and Parisian influence now extends very widely, as the École des Beaux-Arts is resorted to by art students from all countries except Germany.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">British.</hi></p><p>The modern British @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> school begins with the painters of miniature portraits in the 16 th and 17th centuries, among whom the earliest were Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver, artists of some note in the reign of Elizabeth. Many very beautiful miniatures were produced by them and by the younger Peter Oliver, who rose into celebrity under the Commonwealth.</p><p>Other able portrait painters of the 17th</p><p>century were the Scotch Jamesone, a pupil of Rubens, William Dobson, a pupil of Vandyck, @@<hi rend="superscript">3 </hi>and Samuel Cooper ; but the chief court painters after the Restoration were the Flemish Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose influence on art in England was disastrous. The 18th century produced many painters of the highest merit, as Hogarth, who stands unrivalled as a caricaturist and moralist, Reynolds and his rival Gainsborough, notable among the chief portrait painters of the world (see figs. 40 and</p><p>41), and Richard Wilson, the founder of the English school of landscape, the chief artistic speciality of the country. The three brothers Smith of Chichester, Gainsborough, and later in the</p><p>century John (Old)</p><p> Crome of Norwich and James Ward, were all landscape painters of great ability. England has since the 18th century been specially famed for its school of water-colour painters, of which Paul Sandby was one of the founders; he was followed by Wheat- ley, Webber, Girtin, and Prout. Sir Henry Raeburn was a Scottish portrait painter of the highest rank (see fig. 42), but was far less admired in England than the very feeble Lawrence. Little can be said in favour of many of the most popular</p><p>painters of that time, as West, Barry, Fuseli, North- cote, and Shee, who practised what was considered the highest</p><p>branches of art, such as historical painting.</p><p>William Blake, in spite of his wonderful poetical and imaginative power, lived and died with very inadequate recognition.
