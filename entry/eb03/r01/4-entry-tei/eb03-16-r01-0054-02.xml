<p><label>REGION</label>
in geography, a large extent oſ land, in-habited by many people of the ſame nation, and incloſed within certain limits or bounds.</p><p>The modern aſtronomers divide the moon into ſeveral regions, or large tracts of land, to each of which they give its proper name.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Region, in phyſiology, is taken for a diviſion of our ■atmoſphere, which is divided into the upper, middle, and Iower regions.</hi></p><p>The upper region commences from the tops of the -mountains, and reaches to the utmoſt limits of the at-moſphere. In this region reign a perpetual, equable, calmneſs, clearneſs, and ſerenity. The middle region is that in which the clouds reſide, and where meteors are formed, extending from the extremity of the loweſt to the tops of the higheſt mountains. The loweſt region is that in which we breathe, which is bounded by the reflection of the fun’s rays ; or by the height to which they rebound from the earth. See Atmosphere and Air.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Æthereal Region,</hi> in cofmography, is the whole ex-tent of the univerſe, in which is included all the heavenly bodies, and even the orb of the fixed ſtars.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Elementary Region,</hi> according to the Ariſtotelians, is a ſphere terminated by the concavity of the moon’s orb, comprehending the atmoſphere of the earth.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Region, in anatomy, a diviſion of the human body, otherwiſe ealled</hi> <hi rend="italic">cavity,</hi> of which anatomiſts reckon three, viz. the upper region, or that of the head ; the middle region, that of the thorax or breaſt ; and the lower, the abdomen, or belly. See Anatomy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Region, in ancient Rome, was a part or diviſton of •the city. The regions were only four in number, till Auguſtus Cæiar’s time, who divided the city into fourteen ; over each of which he fettled two furveyors, called</hi> <hi rend="italic">curatores viarum,</hi> who were appointed annually, and took their diviſions by lot. Theſe fourteen regions contained four hundred and twenty-four ſtreets, thirty-one of which were called <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> or <hi rend="italic">royal Jlreets,</hi> which began at the gilt pillar that ſtood at the entry of the open place, in the middle of the city. The extent of theſe diviſions varied greatly, ſome being from 12000 or 13000 to 33000 feet or upwards in circumference. Authors, however, are not agreed as to the exact limits of each. The curatores viarum wore the purple, had each two lictors in their proper divilions, had ſlaves under them .to take care of fires, that happened to break ■out. They had alſo two officers, called <hi rend="italic">denunciatores,</hi> in each region, to give account of any diſorders. Four <hi rend="italic">vιco-rnagijlri</hi> alſo were appointed in each ſtreet, who took care of the ſtreets allotted them, and carried the orders of the city to each citizen.</p>
