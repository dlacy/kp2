<p><label>RANAI</label>
one of the Sandwich iſlands diſcovered by Captain Cooke, is about nine miles diſtant from Mowee and Morotoi, and is ſituated to the ſouth-weſt of the paſſage between thoſe two iſles. The conntry towards the ſouth is elevated and craggy ; but the other parts of the iſland had a better appearance, and feemed to be well inhabited. It abounds in roots, ſuch as ſweet potatoes, <hi rend="italic">taro,</hi> and yams ; but produces very few plan-tains and bread-fruit trees. The fouth point of Ranai is in the latitude of 20 <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 46' north, and in the longitude of 2c3 <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 8 eaſt.</p>
