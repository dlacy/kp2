In a royal or noble household the fear of poisoning led to the custom of tasting the food or drink before it was served to the master and his guests; this was known as the “ assay ” of meat and drink, and in Spanish was called <hi rend="italic">salυa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">salvar,</hi> to preserve from risk, Lat. <hi rend="italic">salvare,</hi> to save). The term <hi rend="italic">salva</hi> was also applied to the dish or tray on which the food or drink was presented after the tasting process. There seems no doubt that this Spanish word is the source of the English “ salver ”; a parallel is found in the origin of the term “ credence-table,” which is from the Ital. <hi rend="italic">credenza,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">credere,</hi> to believe, trust (see Credence and Credence-Table).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
