See <hi rend="smallcaps">Astringents.</hi></p><p>RESULT, what iβ gathered from a conference, inquiry, meditation, or the like ; or the conclufion and effect thereof.</p><p>RESURRECTION, in theology, is a rifiιιg again ſrom the ftate of the dead and is that event, the be-lief of which conſtitutee one of the principal articles in the Chrittian creed.</p><p>In treating of this object of our faith, it has been uſual to mention, ſirſt, the reſurrection of our Bleffed X„ord, with the character of the witneffes, and the authenticity of the goſpel hiſtory by which it has been proved, and from which, as a conſequence, ours is inferred. But as moſt of the arguments for his reſurrec-tion are contained in the goſpels, and as merely to re-peat them would afford, we hope, but little informa-tion to moſt of our readers, we mean here to take a view of the ſeveral grounds on which the belief of a future exiſtence is ſuppoſed to be founded ; to collect together ſome of the ſentiments of authors and nations concerning the place where departed fpirits reſide ; concerning the nature of their preſent ſtate ; concerning the kinds of their future deſtination ; that we may afterwards ſee how far their notions differ and agree with what we conſider as the doctrines of Scripture.</p><p>Cf a future ſtate, there have ſometimes been found a few wandering and obſcure tribes who ſeemed to enter-tain no notion at all ; though it ſhould be remarked, that ſome oſ theſe were likewiſe obſerved in ſo low a degree oſ ſavage barbarity as not to be acquainted with the uſe oſ the bow, the dart, or the ſling, and as not knowing how to wield a club, or to throw a ſtone, as a weapon of defence *.</p><p>wherever the human mind has been cultivated, or properly ſpeaking, begun to be cultivated, the opinion has likewiſe generally prevailed that human exiſtence is not confined to the preſent ſcene ; nay, ſo very gene-ral has this notion been found among mankind, that many are puzzled how to account for what they ſuppoſe to be almoſt next to its univerſality.</p><p>To explain the phenomenon, ſome have imagined that it is a notion derived by tradition from primeval re-velation. They ſuppofe that the firſt parent of mankind, as a moral agent accountable for his conduct, was informed by his Maker of every thing which it was of importance for him to know ; that he muſt have been acquainted with this doctrine of a future ſtate in parti-cular j and that he could hardly fail to communicate a matter fo intereſting to his poſterity. They ſuppoſ¢, too, that the hiſtory of the tranflatioa of Enoch muſt have made a great noife in the world, and that the re-membrance of it muſt have been long retained and widely diſſuſed ; and they find in the book of Job plain intimations of a reſurrection from the dead, which, from the manner in which they are introduced, they think that very ancient patriarch muſt have received through this channel.</p><p>It is not thought to be any objection to theſe fuppo∙ ſitions, that the Moſt High, when delivering his laws from the top of Mount Sinai, did not enforce them by the awful fonctions of a future ſtate. The intelligent reader of the Scriptures knows that the fonctions of a future ſtate belong to a different and more univerſal diſ-penſation than was that of Moſes ; that the primeval revelation related to that diſpenfotion ; and that the Jewiſh law, with its temporal fonctions, was introduced only to preſerve the knowledge and worſh¾p of the true God among a people too groſs in their conceptions to have been properly influenced by the view of future rewards and puniſhments, of fuch a nature as eye hath not feen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive. He fees at the ſame time, everywhere ſcattered through the old Teſtament, plain indications of the Moſaic economy, being no more than preparatory to the bringing in of a better hope ; and he thinks it evident, that ſuch Jews as underſtood any thing of the nature of that better hope, muſt have been convinced, that, however the <hi rend="italic">ceremonial rites</hi>  of <hi rend="italic">their </hi>religion might be ſuſſiciently guarded by temporal ſanc-tions, the <hi rend="italic">fundamental principles</hi>  of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>  religion and virtue are ſupported by rewards and puniſhments to be diſpen-ſed in a ſtate beyond the grave. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Prophecy</hi>  and <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology.</hi></p><p>That the progenitors of the human race muſt have been inſpired by their Creator with the knowledge of their immortality, and of every thing neceſſary to their everlaſting welfare, cannot, we ſhould think, be queſ-tioned by any one who believes that the world had a beginning, and that it is under the government of good-neſs and juſtice. The progreſs from ſenfe to ſcience is ſo flow, that however capable we may ſuppoſe the ear-lieſt inhabitants of this earth to have been of making philofophical difeoveries, we cannot believe that the Father of mercies left his helpleſs creature to difeover for himſelf his future exiſtence. Death, when firſt preſented to him, muſt have been a ghaſtly object ; and had he been left without any hope of redemption from it, he would undoubtedly have funk into liſtleſsdeſpondency.</p><p>But a proſpect of immortality is ſo pleafing to the human mind, that if it was communicated to the firſt</p><p>man, it would of courſe be cheriſhed by his poſterk ty ; and there is no difficulty in conceiving how it might be handed down by tradition to very remote ages, among ſuch of his defeendents as were not ſcattered over the face of the earth in ſmall and ſavage tribes.—&gt; In the courfe of its progreſs, it would frequently be new-modelled by the ever active imagination ; and at laſt many abſurd and fantaſtic circumſtances would doubtlefs be combined with the original truth, that death puts not an end to human exiſtence.</p><p>But though we are firmly convinced that the flrſt principles of ufeful knowledge, and among them the doctrine of a future ſtate, were communicated to man</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
