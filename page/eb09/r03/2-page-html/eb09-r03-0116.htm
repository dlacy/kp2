<p><span class="font0">naming him gonfalonier of the church. Thereupon Ladislaus concluded a sham peace, and then, seizing Rome,&nbsp;put it to the sack and established his own government&nbsp;there. Thus John, like the other two popes, became&nbsp;a wanderer in Italy. In August 1414 Ladislaus died and&nbsp;was succeeded by the scandalous Queen Joanna II. The&nbsp;Roman people promptly expelled the Neapolitans, and&nbsp;Cardinal Isolani, John’s legate, succeeding in rousing a&nbsp;reaction in favour of the church, constituted a government of thirteen “ conservators” on the 19th October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In November 1414 the council of Constance assembled, and at last ended the schism by deposing all the popes,&nbsp;and incarcerating John XXIII., the most turbulent of&nbsp;the three. On the Ilth November 1417 Oddo Colonna&nbsp;was unanimously elected to the papal chair ; he was&nbsp;consecrated in the cathedral on the 27 th as Pope Martin&nbsp;V., and, being acknowledged by all, hastened without delay&nbsp;to take possession of his see. Meanwhile disorder was&nbsp;at. its height in Rome. The cardinal legate Isolani&nbsp;’ governed as he best could, while Castle St Angelo remained in the hands of the Neapolitans, who still had a&nbsp;party in the city. In this divided state of affairs Braccio,&nbsp;a daring captain of adventurers, nicknamed Fortebraccio,&nbsp;was inspired with the idea of making himself master of&nbsp;Rome. Overcoming the feeble resistance opposed to him,&nbsp;he succeeded in this on the l6th June 1416 and assumed&nbsp;the title of “ Defensor Urbis.” But Joanna of Naples&nbsp;despatched Sforza, an equally valiant captain, against him,&nbsp;and, without offering battle, Fortebraccio withdrew on the&nbsp;26th August, after having been absolute master of the&nbsp;eternal city for seventy days. Sforza marched in on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">27th, and took possession of the city in the name of Joanna. Martin V. instantly proved himself a good&nbsp;statesman. He confirmed the legate Isolani as his vicar,&nbsp;and Giovanni Savelli as senator. Leaving Constance on&nbsp;the 16th May 1418, he reached Milan on the 12th&nbsp;October, and slowly proceeded on his journey. While in&nbsp;Florence he despatched his brother and nephew to Naples&nbsp;to make alliance with Joanna, and caused her to be&nbsp;crowned on the 28th October 1419 by his legate&nbsp;Morosini. Upon this she promised to give up Rome to&nbsp;the pope. Her general, Sforza, then entered the service&nbsp;of Martin V., and compelled Fortebraccio, who was&nbsp;lingering in a threatening attitude at Perugia, to make&nbsp;peace with the pope. The latter entrusted Fortebraccio&nbsp;with the conduct of the campaign against Bologna, and&nbsp;that city was reduced to submission on the 15 th July&nbsp;1420. The Romans had already yielded to Martin’s brother&nbsp;the legate, and now earnestly besought the arrival of their&nbsp;pope. Accordinglyhe left Florence on the 19th September&nbsp;1420, and entered the Vatican on the 28th. Rome was in&nbsp;ruins ; nobility and burghers were equally disorganized,&nbsp;the people unable to bear arms and careless of their rights,&nbsp;while the battered walls of the Capitol recorded the fall of&nbsp;two republics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Martin V. had now to fulfil a far more difficult task than that of taking possession of Rome. Throughout Italy&nbsp;municipal freedom was overthrown, and the Roman&nbsp;republic had ceased to exist. The Middle Ages were&nbsp;ended; the Renaissance was beginning. The universal&nbsp;unity both of church and of empire was dissolved; the&nbsp;empire was now Germanic, and derived its principal&nbsp;strength from direct dominion over a few provinces.&nbsp;Independent -and national states were already formed&nbsp;or forming on all sides. The papacy itself had ceased&nbsp;to claim universal supremacy over the world’s Governments, and the possession of a temporal state had become&nbsp;essential to its existence. In fact Martin V. was the first&nbsp;of the series of popes who were real sovereigns, and more&nbsp;occupied with politics than religion. Involved in all the&nbsp;foreign intrigues, falsehoods, and treacheries of Italian&nbsp;diplomacy in the 15th century, their internal policy was&nbsp;imbued with all the arts practised by the tyrants of the&nbsp;Renaissance, and nepotism became necessarily the basis of&nbsp;their strength. It was natural that men suddenly elected&nbsp;sovereigns of a new country where they had no ties, and&nbsp;of which they had often no knowledge, should seek to&nbsp;strengthen their position by aggrandizing so-called nephews&nbsp;who were not Unfrequently their sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Martin V. reduced the remains of the free Roman ' Government to a mere civil municipality. Following the&nbsp;method of the other despots of Italy, the old republican&nbsp;institutions were allowed to retain their names and forms,&nbsp;their administrative and some of their judicial attributes,&nbsp;while all their political functions were transferred to the new&nbsp;Government. Order was re-established, and justice rigidly&nbsp;observed. Many rebellious places were subdued by the&nbsp;sword, and many leaders of armed bands were hanged.&nbsp;The pope, however, was forced to lean on his kinsmen the&nbsp;Colonna and again raise them to power by grants of vast&nbsp;fiefs both in his own state and the Neapolitan territory.&nbsp;And, after first supporting Joanna II., who had assisted his&nbsp;entry into Rome, he next sided with her adversary, Louis&nbsp;of Anjou, and then with Alphonso of Aragon, the conqueror of both and the constant friend of the pope, who at&nbsp;last felt safe on his throne. Rome now enjoyed order,&nbsp;peace, and security, but had lost all hope of liberty. And&nbsp;when Martin died (20th February 1431) these words were&nbsp;inscribed on his tomb, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Temporum suorum félicitas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Eugenius IV. (1431-47) leant on the Orsini, and was fiercely opposed by the Colonna, who excited the people&nbsp;against him. Accordingly on the 29th May 1434 the&nbsp;Romans rose in revolt to the old cry of “ Popolo e popolo,”&nbsp;and again constituted the rule of the seven governors&nbsp;of liberty. The pope fled by boat down the Tiber, and,&nbsp;being pursued with stones and shots, narrowly escaped with&nbsp;his life. On reaching Florence, he turned his energies to&nbsp;the recovery of the state. It was necessary to quell the&nbsp;people ; but, first of all, the Colonna and the clan of the&nbsp;prefects of Vico, with their renewed princely power, had&nbsp;to be overthrown. The Orsini were still his friends.&nbsp;Eugenius entrusted the campaign to Patriarch (afterwards&nbsp;Cardinal) Vitelleschi, a worthy successor of Albornoz, and&nbsp;of greater ferocity if less talent. This leader marched&nbsp;his army towards Rome, and, instantly attacking Giovanni,&nbsp;prefect of Vico, captured and beheaded him. The family&nbsp;was now extinguished; and, its possessions reverting to the&nbsp;church, the greater part of them were sold or given to&nbsp;Count Everso d’Anguillara, of the house of Orsini. The&nbsp;prefecture, now little more than an honorary title, was&nbsp;bestowed at will by the popes. Eugenius gave it to&nbsp;Francesco, founder of the powerful line of the Gravina-Orsini. Thus one noble family was raised to greatness&nbsp;while another perished by the sword. Vitelleschi had&nbsp;already begun to persecute the Colonna and the Savelli,&nbsp;and committed terrible slaughter among them. Many&nbsp;castles were demolished, many towns destroyed ; and their&nbsp;inhabitants, driven to wander famine-stricken over the&nbsp;Campagna, had to sell themselves as slaves for the sake of&nbsp;bread. Finally the arrogant patriarch marched into Rome,&nbsp;as into a conquered city, at the head of his men, and the&nbsp;Romans crouched at his feet. The pope now began to&nbsp;distrust him, and sent Scarampo, another prelate of the&nbsp;same stamp, to take his place. This new commander soon&nbsp;arrived, and, perceiving that Vitelleschi proposed to resist,&nbsp;had him surrounded by his soldiers, who were obliged to&nbsp;use force to compel his surrender. ATtelleschi was carried&nbsp;bleeding to Castle St Angelo, where he soon afterwards&nbsp;died. The pope at last returned to Rome in 1443, and&nbsp;remained there quietly till his death in 1447.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
