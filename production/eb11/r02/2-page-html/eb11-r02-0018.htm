<p><span class="font2">which appears to represent the bez-tine of the red-deer; there is no trez-tine, but some distance above the bez the beam is&nbsp;suddenly bent forward to form an “ elbow,” on the posterior&nbsp;side of which is usually a short back-tine; above the back-tine&nbsp;the beam is continued for some distance to terminate in a large&nbsp;expansion or palmation. The antlers of females are simple and&nbsp;generally smaller. The muzzle is entirely hairy; the ears and&nbsp;tail are short; and the throat is maned. The coat is unspotted&nbsp;at all ages, with a whitish area in the region of the tail. The&nbsp;main hoofs are short and rounded and the lateral hoofs very&nbsp;large. There is a tarsal, but no metatarsal gland and tuft. In&nbsp;the skull the gland-pit is shallow, and the vacuity of moderate&nbsp;size; the nasal bones are well developed, and much expanded&nbsp;at the upper end. Upper canines are wanting; the cheek-teeth&nbsp;are small and low-crowned, with the third lobe of the last molar&nbsp;in the lower jaw minute. The lateral metacarpal bones are&nbsp;represented only by their lower extremities; the importance of&nbsp;this feature being noticed in the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In spite of the existence of a number of more or less well-marked geographical forms, reindeer from all parts of the northern hemisphere present such a marked similarity that it seems preferable&nbsp;to regard them as all belonging to a single widespread species, of&nbsp;which most of the characters will be the same as those of the genus.&nbsp;American naturalists, however, generally regard these as distinct&nbsp;species. The coat is remarkable for its density and compactness;&nbsp;the general colour of the head.and upper parts being clove-brown,&nbsp;with more or less white or whitish grey on the under parts and inner&nbsp;surfaces of the limbs, w hile there is also some white above the hoofs&nbsp;and on the muzzle, and there may be whitish rings round the eyes;&nbsp;there is a white area in the region of the tail, which includes the sides&nbsp;but not the upper surface of the latter ; and the tarsal tuft is generally white. The antlers are smooth, and brownish white in colour,&nbsp;but the hoofs jet black. Albino varieties occasionally occur in the&nbsp;wild state. A height of 4 ft. io in. at the shoulder has been recorded in the case of one race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wild Scandinavian reindeer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rangifer tarandus)</span><span class="font1"> may be regarded as the typical form of the species. It is a smaller animal than the American woodland race, with antlers approximating to&nbsp;those of the barren-ground race, but less elongated, and with a&nbsp;distinct back-tine in the male, the brow-tines moderately palmated&nbsp;and frequently nearly symmetrical, and the bez-tine not excessively expanded. Female antlers are generally much smaller&nbsp;than those of males, although occasionally as large, but with much&nbsp;fewer points. The antlers make their appearance at an unusually&nbsp;early age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Madison Grant considers that American reindeer, or caribou, may be grouped under two types, one represented by the barren-ground caribou R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tarandus arcticus,</span><span class="font1"> which is a small animal with&nbsp;immense antlers characterized by the length of the beam, and the&nbsp;consequent wide separation of the terminal palmation from the&nbsp;brow-tine; and the other by the woodland-caribou </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(R. t. caribou),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is a larger animal with shorter and more massiye antlers,&nbsp;in which the great terminal expansions are in approximation to&nbsp;the brow-tine owing to the shortness of the beam. Up to 1902&nbsp;seven other American races had been described, four of which are&nbsp;grouped by Grant with the first and three with the second type.&nbsp;Some of these forms are, however, more or less intermediate between&nbsp;the two main types, as is a pair of antlers from Novaia Zemlia&nbsp;described by the present writer as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. t. pearsoni,</span><span class="font1"> The Scandinavian&nbsp;reindeer is identified by Mr Grant with the barren-ground type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reindeer are domesticated by the Lapps and other nationalities of northern Europe and Asia, to whom these animals are all-important. Domesticated reindeer have also been introduced into&nbsp;Alaska.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REINECKE, CARL HEINRICH CARSTEN (1824-1910), German composer and pianist, was bom at Altona on the 23rd of&nbsp;June 1824; his father, Peter Reinecke (who was also his teacher),&nbsp;being an accomplished musician. At the age of eleven he made&nbsp;his first appearance as a pianist, and when scarcely eighteen he&nbsp;went on a successful tour through Denmark and Sweden. After&nbsp;a stay in Leipzig, where he studied under Mendelssohn and&nbsp;under Schumann, Reinecke went on tour with Konigslow and&nbsp;Wasielewski, Schumann’s biographer, in North Germany and&nbsp;Denmark. From 1846 to 1848 Reinecke was court pianist to&nbsp;Christian VIII. of Denmark. After resigning this post he went&nbsp;first to Paris, and next to Cologne, as professor in the Con-servatorium. From 1854 to 1859 he was music director at&nbsp;Barmen, in the latter year filling this post at Breslau University;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in i860 he became conductor of the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus, a post which (together with that of professor at the Conserva-torium) he held with honour and distinction for thirty-five&nbsp;years. He finally retired into private life in 1902 and died&nbsp;in March 1910. During this time Reinecke continually made&nbsp;concert tours to England and elsewhere. His pianoforte playing&nbsp;belonged to a school now almost extinct. Grace and neatness&nbsp;were its characteristics, and at one time Reinecke was probably&nbsp;unrivalled as a Mozart player and an accompanist. His grand&nbsp;opera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">König Manfred,</span><span class="font2"> and the comic opera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Auf hohen Befehl,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">were at one time frequently played in Germany; and his&nbsp;cantata </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hakon Jarl</span><span class="font2"> is melodiously beautiful, as are many of his&nbsp;songs; while his Friedensfeier overture was once quite hackneyed. By far his most valuable works are those written&nbsp;for educational purposes. His sonatinas, his “ Kindergarten ” and much that he has ably edited will keep his name&nbsp;alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REINHART, CHARLES STANLEY (1844-1896), American painter and illustrator, was bom at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,&nbsp;and after having been employed in railway work and at a steel&nbsp;factory, studied art in Paris and at the Munich Academy under&nbsp;Straehuber and Otto. He afterwards settled in New York,&nbsp;but spent the years 1882-1886 in Paris. He was a regular&nbsp;exhibitor at the National Academy in New York, and contributed illustrations in black and white and in colours to the&nbsp;leading American periodicals. He died in 1896. Among his&nbsp;best-known pictures are: “ Reconnoitring,” “ Caught Napping,”&nbsp;“ September Morning,” “ Mussel Fisherwoman,” “ At the&nbsp;Ferry,” “ Normandy Coast,” “ Gathering Wood,” “ The Old&nbsp;Life Boat,” “ Sunday,” and “ English Garden but it is as an&nbsp;illustrator that he is best known.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REINHART, JOACHIM CHRISTIAN (1761-1847), German painter and etcher, was bom at Hof in Bavaria in 1761, and&nbsp;studied under Oeser at Leipzig and under Klingel at Dresden.&nbsp;In 1789 he went to Rome, where he became a follower of the&nbsp;classicist German painters Carstens and Koch. He devoted&nbsp;himself more particularly to landscape painting and to aquatint&nbsp;engraving. Examples of his landscapes are to be found at&nbsp;most of the important German galleries, notably at Frankfort,&nbsp;Munich, Leipzig and Gotha. In Rome he executed a series&nbsp;of landscape frescoes for the Villa MassimL He died in Rome&nbsp;in 1847.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REINHOLD, KARL LEONHARD (1758-1823), German philosopher, was bom at Vienna. At the age of fourteen he&nbsp;entered the Jesuit college of St Anna, on the dissolution of which&nbsp;(1774) he joined a similar college of the order of St Barnabas.&nbsp;Finding himself out of sympathy with monastic life, he fled in&nbsp;1783 to North Germany, and settled in Weimar, where he&nbsp;became Wieland's </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">collaborateur</span><span class="font2"> on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">German Mercury,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;eventually his son-in-law. In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">German Mercury</span><span class="font2"> he published,&nbsp;in the years 1786-87, his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Briefe Über die Kantische Philosophie,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which were most important in making Kant known to a wider&nbsp;circle of readers. As a result of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,</span><span class="font2"> Reinhold received&nbsp;a call to the university of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to&nbsp;1794. In 1789 he published his chief work, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Versuch einer&nbsp;neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens,</span><span class="font2"> in which&nbsp;he attempted to simplify the Kantian theory and make it more&nbsp;of a unity. In 1794 he accepted a call to Kiel, where he taught&nbsp;till his death in 1823, but his independent activity was at an&nbsp;end. In later life he was powerfully influenced by Fichte, and&nbsp;subsequently, on grounds of religious feeling, by Jacobi and&nbsp;Bardili. His historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier&nbsp;activity. The development of the Kantian standpoint contained&nbsp;in the “ New Theory of Human Understanding ” (1789), and in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fundament des philosophischen Wissens</span><span class="font2"> (1791), was called&nbsp;by its author </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elementarphilosophie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, “ Reinhold lays greater emphasis than Kant upon the unity and activity of consciousness. The principle of consciousness tells us&nbsp;that every idea is related both to an object and a subject, and is&nbsp;partly to be distinguished, partly united to both. Since form&nbsp;cannot produce matter nor subject object, we are forced to assume&nbsp;a thing-in-itself. But this is a notion which Js self-contradictory&nbsp;if consciousness be essentially a relating activity. There is there</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
