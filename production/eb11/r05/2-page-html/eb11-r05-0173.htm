On the first day of&nbsp;hostilities Rear-Admiral Uriu disembarked troops at&nbsp;Chemulpo under the eyes of the Russian cruiser</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4t</sup> Variag,” and next day he attacked and destroyed the “ Variag &quot; and some smaller war-vessels in the harbour, and&nbsp;the rest of the 1st Army (General Tiuroki) was gradually brought&nbsp;over during February and March, in spite of an unbeaten and,&nbsp;under Makârov’s regime, an enterprising hostile navy. But&nbsp;owing to the thaw and the subsequent break-up of the miserable Korean roads, six weeks passed before the columns of the&nbsp;army (Guard, 2nd and 12th divisions), strung out along the&nbsp;“ Mandarin road ” to a total depth of six days’ march, closed&nbsp;upon the head at Wiju, the frontier town on the Yalu. Opposite&nbsp;to them they found a large Russian force of all arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russian commanders, at this stage at least, had not and could not. have any definite objective. Both by sea and by&nbsp;land their policy was to mass their resources, repulsing meantime the attacks of the Japanese with as much damage to the&nbsp;enemy and as little to themselves as possible. Their strategy&nbsp;was to gain time without immobilizing themselves so far that the&nbsp;Japanese could impose a decisive action at the moment that&nbsp;suited them best. Both by sea and by land, such strategy was&nbsp;an exceedingly difficult game to play. But afloat, had Makârov&nbsp;survived, it would have been played to the end, and Togo’s fleet&nbsp;would have been steadily used up. One day, indeed (May 15th),&nbsp;two of Japan’s largest battleships, the “ Hatsume ” and the&nbsp;<sup>0</sup> Yashima,” came in contact with free mines and were sunk.&nbsp;One of them went to the bottom with five hundred souls. But&nbsp;the admiral was not on board. The Russian sailors said, when&nbsp;Makârov’s fate was made known, “ It is not the loss of a battleship. The Japanese are welcome to two of them. It is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">he.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Not only the skill, but the force of character required for playing&nbsp;with fire, was wanting to Makârov’s successors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was much the same on land. Kuropatkin, who had taken command of the army, saw from the first that he would have&nbsp;to gain three months, and disposed his forces as they&nbsp;came on the scene, unit by unit, in perfect accord&nbsp;with the necessities of the case. His expressed intention&nbsp;was to fight no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">battle</span><span class="font0"> until superiority in numbers was on his&nbsp;side. He could have gained his respite by concentrating at&nbsp;Harbin or even at Mukden or at Liao-Yang. But he had to&nbsp;reckon with the fleet@@<sup>1</sup> at Port Arthur. He knew that the'&nbsp;defences of that place were defective, and that if the fleet were&nbsp;destroyed whilst that of Togo kept the sea, there would be no&nbsp;Russian offensive. He therefore chose Liao-Yang as the point&nbsp;of concentration, and having thus to gain time by force instead&nbsp;of by distance, he pushed out a strong covering detachment</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">towards the Yalu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But little by little he succumbed to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">milieu &gt;</span><span class="font0"> the atmosphere of false confidence and passivity created around him by Alexeiev.&nbsp;After he had minutely arranged the Eastern Detachment in a&nbsp;series of rearguard positions, so that each fraction of it could&nbsp;contribute a little to the game of delaying the enemy before&nbsp;retiring on the positions next in rear, the commander of the&nbsp;detachment, Zasulich, told him that “ it was not the custom&nbsp;of a knight of the order of St George to retreat,” and Kuropatkin&nbsp;did not use his authority to recall the general, who, whether&nbsp;competent or not, obviously misunderstood his mission. Thus,&nbsp;whilst the detachment was still disposed as a series of rearguards, the foremost fractions of it stood to fight on the Yalu,&nbsp;against odds of four to one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Japanese 1st Army was carefully concealed about Wiju until it was ready to strike. Determined that in this first battle&nbsp;against a white nation they would show their mettle, the&nbsp;Japanese lavished both time and forethought on the minutest&nbsp;preparations. Forethought was still busy when, in accordance&nbsp;with instructions from Tokio, Kuroki on the 30th of April&nbsp;ordered the attack to begin at daybreak on the 1st of May.&nbsp;Eor several miles above Antung the rivers Yalu and Aiho arc&nbsp;parallel and connected by numerous channels. The majority&nbsp;of the islands thus formed were held and had been bridged by&nbsp;the Japanese. The points of passage were commanded by high&nbsp;ground a little farther up where the valleys definitely diverge,&nbsp;and beyond the flank of the ill-concealed positions of the defence.&nbsp;The first task of the right division (12th) was to cross the upper&nbsp;Yalu and seize this. To the Guard and 2nd divisions was&nbsp;assigned the frontal attack on the Chiuliencheng&nbsp;position, where the Russians had about one-half of&nbsp;their forces under Major-General Kashtalinski. On&nbsp;the 30th of April, Inouye’s 12th division accomplished its&nbsp;task of clearing the high ground up to the Aiho. The&nbsp;Russians, though well aware that the force in their front&nbsp;was an army, neither retired nor concentrated. Zasulich’s&nbsp;medieval generalship had been modified so far that he intended&nbsp;to retreat when he had taught the Japanese a lesson, and therefore Kuropatkin’s original arrangements were not sensibly&nbsp;modified. So it came about that the combined attack of the&nbsp;2nd and Guard divisions against the front, and Inouye on the&nbsp;left flank and rear, found Kashtalinski without support. After&nbsp;a rather ineffective artillery bombardment the Japanese advanced&nbsp;in full force, without hesitation or finesse, and plunging into the&nbsp;river, stormed forward under a heavy fire. A few moments afterwards Zasulich ordered the retreat. But the pressure was far too&nbsp;close now. Broken up by superior numbers the Russian line parted&nbsp;into groups, each of which, after resisting bravely for a time, was&nbsp;driven back. Then the frontal attack stopped and both divisions&nbsp;abandoned themselves to the intoxication of victory. Meanwhile, the right attack (12th division) encountering no very&nbsp;serious resistance, crossed the Aiho and began to move on the left&nbsp;rear of the Russians. On the side of the defence, each colonel had&nbsp;been left to retire as best he could, and thus certain fractions&nbsp;of the retreating Russians encountered Inouye’s advancing&nbsp;troops and were destroyed after a most gallant resistance. The&nbsp;rearguard itself, at Hama tan, was almost entirely sacrificed,&nbsp;owing to the wrong direction taken in retreating by its left&nbsp;flankguard. Fresh attempts were made by subordinates to&nbsp;form rearguards, but Zasulich made no stand even at Feng-hwang-cheng, and the Japanese occupied that town unopposed&nbsp;on the 5th of May. The Japanese losses were 1100 out of over&nbsp;40,000 present, the Russian (chiefly in*the retreat) at least 2500&nbsp;out of some 7000 engaged.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Not, as is often assumed, the fortress itself.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">The Yalu, like Valmy, was a moment in the world’s history. It mattered little that the Russians had escaped or that they&nbsp;had been in inferior numbers. The serious fact was that they&nbsp;had been beaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general distribution of the Russian forces was now as follows: The main army under Kuropatkin was forming, by&nbsp;successive brigades, in two groups—I. Siberian Corps (Stakel-berg), Niu-chwang and Kaiping; II. Siberian Corps, Liao-Yang.&nbsp;Zasulich (III. Corps and various other units) had still 21,000. In&nbsp;the Port Arthur “ fortified rayon,” under Lieut.-General Stoessel&nbsp;(IV. Corps), were 27,000 men, and General Linievich around&nbsp;Vladivostok had 23,000. These are, however, paper strengths&nbsp;only, and the actual number for duty cannot have been higher&nbsp;than 110,000 in all. The Trans-Siberian railway was the only&nbsp;line of communication with Europe and western Siberia, and&nbsp;its calculated output of men was 40,000 a month in the summer.&nbsp;In October 1004, therefore, supposing the Japanese to have used&nbsp;part of their forces against Port Arthur, and setting this off&nbsp;against the absence of Linievich and Stoessel, Kuropatkin could&nbsp;expect to have a sufficient superiority in numbers to take the&nbsp;offensive. His policy was still, “ No battle before we are in&nbsp;superior force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the moment it was equally Japan’s interest to mark time in Manchuria. Still intent upon the Russian Port Arthur squadron,&nbsp;she had embarked her 2nd Army (General Oku, 1st, 3rd,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4th and 5th divisions) during April, and sent it to Chinampo whence, as soon as the ice melted and&nbsp;Kuroki’s victory cleared the air, it sailed to the&nbsp;selected landing-place near Pitszewo.
