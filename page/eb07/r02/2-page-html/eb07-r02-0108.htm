<p><span class="font1">ing and trembling at the chimæras with which his imagination peopled solitudes—could the phantoms bred in his eccentric brain, and nurtured amidst the fumes of a Berlin&nbsp;tavern, have ever assumed tllat appearance of reality and&nbsp;belief which could render their introduction into a work of&nbsp;fiction at all practicable. Only by a mind accustomed,&nbsp;from a painful experience, to brood over and dissect the&nbsp;origin and connexion of these strange phenomena, half&nbsp;mental half physical, which make “ life a dream,” but with&nbsp;a nightmare accompaniment, could the possible connexion&nbsp;of this phantasmagoria with real existence, in morbid minds,&nbsp;be rendered so far intelligible as to redeem them from the&nbsp;charge of the merest puerility. Hoffmann’s tales, though&nbsp;they constantly suggest the idea that they have had their&nbsp;source in tile inspiration of opium, seem really to be the&nbsp;only compositions in this style of grotesque horror, which&nbsp;can be said to possess the redeeming quality of genius.&nbsp;They remind us of the images of our dreams, calling up&nbsp;before us, as in sleep, long perspectives of gloomy vastness,&nbsp;broken here and there by the light of the strangest ignes&nbsp;fatui, along which are seen, flitting in antic movements,&nbsp;bands of the most fantastic creatures, such as those which, in&nbsp;the pictures of Teniers, disturb the solitude of St. Anthony,&nbsp;or which give a strange blending of the humorous and the&nbsp;horrible to the distempered sketches of Callot. Yet, as&nbsp;a proof that the talent of Hoffmann was by no means confined merely to the fantastic and the supernatural, we may&nbsp;notice his truthful and vigorous picture of the German&nbsp;burgher life of the middle ages, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Master Martin and&nbsp;his Apprentices,</span><span class="font1"> and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mademoiselle de Scudery,</span><span class="font1"> a tale&nbsp;of vivid and fascinating interest, founded on a historical&nbsp;groundιvork, moving in the simplest and most direct manner towards its object, and exciting the feeling of curiosity&nbsp;and suspense even to the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some notoriety of an evil kind was obtained by a class of novels, in which the attempt was made to invest sensuality&nbsp;with tlle graces of art, or to merge art in sensuality. Such&nbsp;were the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ardιηghello</span><span class="font1"> of Heinse (1749—1803), in which&nbsp;painting was made the apology for the introduction of voluptuous pictures, and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hildegard von Hοhenthal,</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;which music was made to minister to a similar purpose,—&nbsp;no unfit sequel to a literary life which commenced with a&nbsp;translation of Petronius. In truth, in the whole range of&nbsp;the German novels, the tendency to an undue license of this&nbsp;kind is observable. In those of Goethe, though veiled by&nbsp;an appearance of decency, it is sufficiently perceptible ; nor&nbsp;does Tieck appear free from the common taint. Many passages in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelm Meister</span><span class="font1"> are highly objectionable ; and&nbsp;such a novel as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wahlverwandschαften</span><span class="font1"> we regard as&nbsp;untranslateable into English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of Goethe’s novels we have already expressed our opinion in our biographical article on Goethe himself. If the merits of a novel consisted, not in exhibiting an epitome of&nbsp;human life, more or less poetically conceived, according to&nbsp;the prosaic or imaginative turn of the writer’s mind, but in&nbsp;speculating ingeniously on painting, agriculture, landscape,&nbsp;gardening, tile rules of good composition, or the state of the&nbsp;theatre, connecting these speculations by a thread of mystical narrative, and introducing us to a set of beings without&nbsp;the least trace </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">reality about them, who all appear to be&nbsp;playing some theatrical part in a dreamy representation of&nbsp;life, which seems to have no intelligible object,—Goethe&nbsp;may be a great novelist. With an English public, demanding some firm basis of reality, instead of that unsubstantial&nbsp;cloud-land which envelopes us in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelm Meister’s&nbsp;Lehrjahre</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wandcrjahre,</span><span class="font1"> and accustomed to insist on&nbsp;a plain meaning as a preliminary to poetical embellishment,&nbsp;he never can be a favourite. A novel which does not explain its purpose without a commentary, seems to violate&nbsp;the essential laws of such compositions ; but a novel, in regard to the object of which no two commentators agree, is&nbsp;an anomaly in literature. Most of the German critics, indeed, though professing a great admiration of these singular performances of Goethe, are careful to confine their observations, in regard to the meaning or object of the novels,&nbsp;to the merest generalities. They describe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelm Meister,</span><span class="font1"> to use the congenial language of an English admirer,&nbsp;as a picture “ of warm, hearty, sunny, human endeavour,&nbsp;a free recognition of life in its depth, variety, and majesty,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">but as yet nο divinity recognised there?</span><span class="font1"> The latter portion of the sentence is intelligible, and is unfortunately true,&nbsp;but the rest reminds us of Mr. Dangle’s remark, that the&nbsp;interpreter appears </span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">harder to be understood of the&nbsp;two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These observations apply, with slight modification, to the novels of Tieck, when be abandons the province of the&nbsp;traditional tale, and attempts subjects connected witll real&nbsp;life ; the characters, the incidents, tlle whole cast of the tale,&nbsp;appear so extravagant, that, but for the grave and laudatory criticism with which these effusions seem invariably to&nbsp;be received by his countrymen, it would be difficult to believe the author serious. His first romance, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">William Lovef&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was a gloomy and revolting extravagance, and his later&nbsp;caprices, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Alte Buch,</span><span class="font1"> (the Old Book), the Fo-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gelscheuche,</span><span class="font1"> (Scarecrow), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eigcnsinη und Laune,</span><span class="font1"> (Self-will&nbsp;and Humour), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wundxrlichheiteη,</span><span class="font1"> (Marvels), are utterly&nbsp;unworthy of a man of genius. Even the merits,ofhis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dich-terlxben,</span><span class="font1"> (a Poet’s Life), have been greatly exaggerated.&nbsp;Any tale, in which Marlowe and Shakespeare figure as actors, has a certain interest for a Briton ; but beyond some&nbsp;eloquent disputations on the drama, and the formation of a&nbsp;poet’s mind, in which Shakespeare and his companions are&nbsp;made to utter modern German theories, the most opposite to&nbsp;English notions of the sixteenth century, we cannot perceive&nbsp;wherein tlle peculiar merit of this much-lauded performance lies. Tieck has said absurdly and presumptuously&nbsp;of Sir Walter Scott, that “ it is surprising how little he&nbsp;wants to be a poet, but how much that little outw<sup>r</sup>eiglιs all&nbsp;that he is.” Let any one who has read Tieck’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aufmhτ&nbsp;in den Cevenηeη,</span><span class="font1"> in which he has come in competition with&nbsp;the Scotch novelist on an historical subject, judge whether he&nbsp;has himself made a nearer approximation to that character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The talent displayed by Schiller inhis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Verbreeher aus Eltre, </span><span class="font1">and his fine fragment of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armenian, or the Ghost Seer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">excites regret that he did not give us less of philosophy’, and&nbsp;more of fiction. The latter is an unfinished taleof mystery,of&nbsp;deep interest, the idea of which, it is supposed, was suggested by the juggleries of Cagliostro, and in which Schiller,&nbsp;though he never witnessed the scenery which he describes,&nbsp;has caught the spirit of silence and secrecy which seems to&nbsp;pervade Venice, with the same success as, in hislf<sup>z</sup>i7∕zcwt </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tell,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">he has transported us into the mountain recesses ofthe Ober-land. And Lord Byron has recorded the strong impression&nbsp;made upon his mind by the recollection of the incomprehensible Armenian, one ofthose conceptions which he w as accustomed by anticipation to associate with the image of the city&nbsp;of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several female novelists, too, have respectably supported the pretensions of their sex; such as Fanny Tarnυw, the&nbsp;Baroness de la Motte Fouque, Johanna Schopenhauer, Henrietta Hanke, and Caroline Pichler, the able authoress of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Agathocles.</span><span class="font1"> Many of their productions exhibit talent,&nbsp;grace, and facility of style, but we should be at a loss to name&nbsp;any for which the praise of genius could justly be claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The class of romances called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Krirninal Geschichten,</span><span class="font1"> t urn-ingon stories of secret guilt discovered by circumstantial evidence,has been a numerous one in Germany. At the head of this class of novelists stands Kruse, who certainly possesses&nbsp;in a high degree a power, which at the present day appears to&nbsp;be rather a rare one,—that of constructing an ingenious and&nbsp;complicated plot, keeping the curiosity constantly on the&nbsp;stretch, and defying conjecture as to the result, till the au-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
