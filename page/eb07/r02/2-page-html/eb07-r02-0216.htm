<p><span class="font0">given to the wheel, the top was moved slowly up the walk, by the workman, the reels at the same time giving out the&nbsp;yams as they were taken up by the twisting. When the&nbsp;workman arrived at the first separator, the iron rods were,&nbsp;by the contrivance already alluded to, at once withdrawn, and&nbsp;the yarns left free, and so the workman proceeded until he&nbsp;arrived at the reel-frame, when the turning or heaving at the&nbsp;hook was stopped, and the strand prevented from untwisting, by being seized in a kind of nipper formed of iron.&nbsp;The ends of the yams were then unfastened from the reels,&nbsp;and the strand was completed. By increasing the size of&nbsp;the reel-frames and separators, and by using three top-minors fixed to a sledge or otherwise, three strands could&nbsp;at the same time have been formed. The strands formed&nbsp;by this machinery were then laid together into ropes in the&nbsp;ordinary manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1793. In April 12th of this year, Mr Richard Fothergill obtained a patent for rope-machinery, embracing the following objects : First, freeing the hemp from its native husk,&nbsp;and fitting it for the subsequent processes ; secondly, dressing the hemp, and drawing it out into slivers fit for spinning ; thirdly, spinning the hemp ; and, fourthly, twisting or&nbsp;making it into ropes or cordage. All these operations required no rope-walk to carry them on. Engravings of the&nbsp;machinery will be found in the fourteenth volume of the&nbsp;second series of the Repertory of Arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1793. In April 25th, Mr Joseph Huddart took out a patent for certain improvements in the formation of ropes. His method of registering the strands, in order to acquire&nbsp;an additional degree of strength, by giving the length of&nbsp;the yarns which compose the strand a certain ratio, according to the angle and hardness or compression the rope&nbsp;is intended to be laid with, and thereby acquiring a more&nbsp;equal distribution of the strain upon the yarns than ropes&nbsp;made in the common way, consisted of the following principles : First, by keeping the yarns separate from each other,&nbsp;and drawing them from bobbins which revolve, to keep up&nbsp;the twist whilst the strand is forming ; secondly, by passing&nbsp;through a register which divides them by circular shells of&nbsp;holes, the number in each shell being agreeable to the distance from the centre of the strand, and the angle the yarns&nbsp;make with a line parallel to it, and gives them a proper&nbsp;position to enter ; thirdly, by a cylindrical tube, which compresses the strand, and maintains a cylindrical figure to its&nbsp;surface ; fourthly, by a gauge to determine the angle which&nbsp;the yarns in the outside shell make with a line parallel to&nbsp;the centre of the strand when registering, and according&nbsp;to the angle made by the yams in this shell, the length of&nbsp;all the yarns in the strand will be determined ; lastly, by&nbsp;hardening up the strand, and thereby increasing the angle&nbsp;in the outside shell, which compensates for the stretching&nbsp;of the yams and compression of the strand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this, as in Belfour’s invention, the rcgistering apparatus was moved up the rope-walk by the twisting of the strand ; but the machine differs from Belfour’s in the following particulars. First, in place of the bobbins or reels&nbsp;being fixed in an upright frame, they are placed in horizontal ranges, each range rising higher from the front towards the back part of the machine. Secondly, in place of&nbsp;the separator of Belfour, sets of horizontal rails, notched&nbsp;to receive the yams, and hung in cleats fixed to upright&nbsp;posts, are placed at regular intervals down the walk, so as&nbsp;to keep the yarns separate the whole length of the strand.&nbsp;Thirdly, in place of Mr Belfour’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">top minor,</span><span class="font0"> a plate pierced&nbsp;with concentric circles of holes is made use of, the circles&nbsp;being about two inches asunder ; and behind this plate a&nbsp;smaller plate, pierced with a similar number of holes, is&nbsp;fixed, the holes in the latter plate being so close together&nbsp;as merely to keep the yarns clear of each other. Immediately behind this last plate is fixed a tube made of thin&nbsp;steel, of a spring temper, and in two parts longitudinally ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the thin edges of the one part overlapping those of the other, and the two parts being compressed by a thong or&nbsp;wire wound round them several times, and fastened to the&nbsp;jaws of an instrument called a heaver. By means of this,&nbsp;the yarns, in passing through the tube, can be compressed&nbsp;by a constant force ; and if the yams be thicker or smaller&nbsp;in different parts of the strand, the tube will expand or contract, to suit the difference of size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to these, an instrument called a register-gauge is used to measure the angle of twist of the yarns in the&nbsp;strands, with the view to employ the same twist when the&nbsp;strands are formed into a rope. Some of the parts of the&nbsp;machinery above noticed, it will be seen, have been adopted&nbsp;by other inventors, and some of them are still in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1797, September 13. At this time Mr William Chapman of Newcastle obtained a first patent for laying, twisting, or making ropes or cordage, of any number of yams&nbsp;or strands, or any number of threads tarred or untarred,&nbsp;from the size of a cable down to the smallest line formed&nbsp;of more than one thread. The machinery for this purpose&nbsp;was less complicated than those formerly mentioned, but&nbsp;was only capable of forming ropes on the common principle. In the month of January 1798 he obtained a patent for Scotland for further improvements in rope-machinery, and containing the substance of his former one and&nbsp;of another taken out for England on the 6th of March</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1798. The inventions embrace the making of ropes either&nbsp;by stationary machines, or by moving machinery on a rope-walk. In the former, the operations of forming the yarns&nbsp;into strands, twisting the strands into a rope, and coiling&nbsp;away the rope, on reels or otherwise, go on at the same&nbsp;time. One of the arrangements of the machinery by which&nbsp;these different operations are carried into effect, is as follows. Three or more discs, according to the number of&nbsp;strands, are placed round a common centre, with their&nbsp;planes inclined to each other in such a manner that their&nbsp;produced axes would meet in a given point. These discs&nbsp;are by the inventor termed strand-tables, and each of them&nbsp;is fixed to a hollow shaft, capable of revolving round its&nbsp;axis ; which shaft is called the strand-shaft or upper shaft.&nbsp;These shafts are on the sides of the discs which are inclined to each other. On the opposite sides of the discs yarn-reels are suspended on spindles, on which they can turn&nbsp;freely. The yams from the reels are passed through the&nbsp;shafts, and by the turning of the discs or strand-tables they&nbsp;are twisted into strands. In a part of the shaft there is a&nbsp;transverse opening to admit of two blocks of hard wood or&nbsp;other matter being applied on each side to press the yarns,&nbsp;and retard their passage through the shafts, so that they may&nbsp;be twisted to the degree required. These blocks are called press-blocks or compressors, and are held together by&nbsp;springs or weights. Instead of blocks the patentee sometimes substitutes rollers moving round their axes, and holding the yarns by their friction. Besides these, the yams&nbsp;pass through a perforated plate called a yarn-guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The strand-tables all move round in one direction, and the strands as they proceed from the shafts are concentrated into a point, over a fixed grooved block, corresponding to the top in the ordinary process. Behind this block&nbsp;the strands are received into a hollow axis, which turns&nbsp;round in a direction contrary to the twist of the strand-tables, and in which the strands are formed into a shroud-laid rope, by being twisted by the apparatus attached to&nbsp;the shaft. This consists of a pair of wheels or sheaves,&nbsp;moving easily on their axes, to admit the rope a free passage, and at the same time compel it to twist equally round&nbsp;with the shaft. These sheaves are grooved in such a manner as to prevent the rope from turning sideways, and are&nbsp;called twisting-sheaves. Instead of the sheaves moving&nbsp;freely on their axes, such a motion may be given to them as.&nbsp;in every revolution of the rope-shaft, which makes one turn</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
