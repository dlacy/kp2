<p><span class="font1">these peculiar circumstances, he obtained 412 votes, while the second of the successful candidates had only 967. This&nbsp;homage to an individual personally unknown, was paid to&nbsp;him as “ the friend of peace, of reform, and of religious liberty.” In his printed address to the independcnt electors&nbsp;of this borough, he expressed his “ conviction that the great&nbsp;work, which must eventually produce the reformation and&nbsp;happiness of the people, was already begun.” An eventful&nbsp;period of twenty years served to evince how well he had&nbsp;discerned tile signs of the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The return of peace did not immediately produce all the benefits that were anticipated. The war-establishment, with&nbsp;its lavish profusion of expenditure, had long contributed to&nbsp;maintain an artificial state of things. When the war was&nbsp;at length brought to a termination, we were overwhelmed&nbsp;with an enormous national debt ; and under such burdens&nbsp;as this debt imposed, it was difficult for manufactures and&nbsp;trade to find a favourable channel. The banking-house&nbsp;with which Roscoe was connected did not escape the commercial pressure of that period. Great exertions were&nbsp;made by the partners to avert the crisis by which they&nbsp;were threatened ; but suspicions having been excited, large&nbsp;balances were suddenly withdrawn from the bank ; and after&nbsp;struggling for a few days in the vain hope of supporting&nbsp;their credit, they were, on the 25th of January 1816, reduced to the necessity of suspending their payments. A&nbsp;committee appointed by the creditors reported that, after&nbsp;the liquidation of the debts, there would remain a surplus&nbsp;of L.6l,l44. The bank was never shut; and the house&nbsp;was allowed six years for discharging all the debts, with interest. Roscoe undertook the management of its affairs,&nbsp;and exerted himself with surprising energy. One of the&nbsp;greatest trials which he sustained, was the necessity of parting with his library, pictures, and other works of art, the&nbsp;valuable and cherished accumulation of nearly half a century. The auction of his library, which was sold by Win-stanley of London, extended to fourteen days, commencing&nbsp;with the 19th of August 1816. It included rare and precious works in several departments, but was particularly&nbsp;rich in Italian literature. The sale of the books was immediately followed by that of the prints, which occupied&nbsp;eleven days, and, being divided into 1352 lots, produced&nbsp;the sum of L.1915. Is. The drawings, consisting of 610&nbsp;lots, and the paintings, of 156, were sold for L.2825. 19s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the midst of these vicissitudes and trials, which he endured with exemplary fortitude, he still retained his love&nbsp;of literature. In the establishment of the Royal Institution&nbsp;of Liverpool, he lent his effective aid. A plan for such an&nbsp;institution had in 1813 been written by Dr Traill, now professor of medical jurisprudence in the university of Edinburgh. The scheme was at length brought towards maturity ; and, after an interval of four years, Mr Roscoe, as&nbsp;chairman of a committee, prepared an explanatory report.&nbsp;He was induced, though not without considerable difficulty,&nbsp;to compose and to deliver the inaugural address at the&nbsp;opening of the institution. The attendance was very numerous, and he received the most gratifying applause. On&nbsp;the ensuing day, he was requested by the committee to publish his discourse, and it accordingly appeared under the&nbsp;subsequent title : “ On the Origin and Vicissitudes of Literature, Science, and Art, and their Influence on the present State of Society : a Discourse delivered on the Opening of the Liverpool Royal Institution, 25th November&nbsp;1817.” In 1819 he published his “ Observations on Penal&nbsp;Jurisprudence, and the Reformation of Offenders.” In 1822&nbsp;appeared his “ Additional Observations” on the same subject ; and a third part followed in 1825. He afterwards&nbsp;published two tracts on the penitentiary discipline of the&nbsp;United States. In all his literary undertakings, he aimed&nbsp;at improving the morals and increasing the happiness </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mankind.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the affairs of the bank had reached their final crisis. The partners found themselves unable to&nbsp;contend with the difficulties which beset and impeded their&nbsp;progress, and a commission of bankruptcy was issued in the&nbsp;year 1820, Having now withdrawn from business, he seems&nbsp;to have placed his chief reliance on the remuneration of his&nbsp;literary labours. Some of his friends privately raised the&nbsp;sum of L.2500, and vested it in trustees for the benefit of&nbsp;himself and his family. “ The office of communicating to&nbsp;him this kind and liberal act, on the part of his friends, was&nbsp;confided to Dr Traill, who by his judicious representations,&nbsp;and affectionate remonstrances, succeeded in removing from&nbsp;the mind of Mr Roscoe the objections which he felt to incur obligations of so serious a nature.” About this period,&nbsp;he found a pleasing employment in arranging and improving the library of Mr Coke, now earl of Leicester, and in&nbsp;preparing a catalogue of the numerous manuscripts. His&nbsp;visits to Holkham were rendered peculiarly pleasant ; and&nbsp;this gentleman, as we are informed, “ conferred upon him&nbsp;obligations of no ordinary nature.” His literary ardour was&nbsp;still unabated ; and in 1822 he published an octavo volume,&nbsp;under the title of “ Blustrations, Historical and Critical, of&nbsp;the Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, called the Magnificent ;&nbsp;with an Appendix of original and other Documents.” An&nbsp;Italian version, exclusive of the appendix, was published at&nbsp;Florence by Pecchioli in the course of the following year.&nbsp;In 1822 he likewise published a “Memoir of Richard Roberts&nbsp;Jones of Aberdaron, in the county of Carnarvon, in North&nbsp;Wales, exhibiting a remarkable instance of a partial power&nbsp;and cultivation of intellect.” This extraordinary character,&nbsp;who was originally a fisher-lad, “ continues to display a&nbsp;love of learning and an extent of erudition seldom exhibited&nbsp;within the walls of schools or universities, united with a&nbsp;want of common sense amounting almost to idiocy, and a&nbsp;squalor and wretchedness of appearance of which a common mendicant would be ashamed.” At Allerton he had&nbsp;a conversation with Dr Parr on languages, oriental and occidental ; and on being afterwards asked his opinion of the&nbsp;learned stranger, he replied, “ He is less ignorant than most&nbsp;men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During this year he quitted his residence in Liverpool, and took a house in Lodge Lane, Toxteth Park, about a&nbsp;mile from the town. Two years afterwards he had the severe misfortune to lose the excellent and cherished partner&nbsp;of all his joys and sorrows. She died on the 24th of September 1824. This event was very deeply felt ; but the&nbsp;affectionate attention of his two daughters afforded some&nbsp;compensation of a loss which it was impossible to repair. In&nbsp;the early part of the year he had been elected an honorary&nbsp;associate of the Royal Society of Literature ; and after an&nbsp;interval of a few months he was appointed an associate of&nbsp;the first class. He thus became entitled to a pension of&nbsp;one hundred guineas ; but, on the death of the king, the&nbsp;annual grant from the privy purse was withheld by his successor. As its total amount was only a thousand pounds,&nbsp;this cannot but be considered as a miserable piece of economy. In 1827 the great gold medal of the society was&nbsp;awarded to him for his merits as an historian. From other&nbsp;learned associations he obtained various honours ; nor must&nbsp;we omit to state that, during the same year, he was elected&nbsp;a corresponding member of the Accademia della Crusca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the spring of 1821 he had been engaged by the London booksellers to undertake a new edition of the Works of Po</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&gt;e. It appeared in 1824, in ten volumes octavo. He&nbsp;contributed a copious and elegant life of the author, and to&nbsp;a selection of the notes of former editors added a few of his&nbsp;own. Of the character of Pope, both as a man and as a&nbsp;poet, he formed a more favourable estimate than either Dr&nbsp;Warton or Mr Bowles. Those who deny or reluctantly&nbsp;concede to Pope the name of a poet, seem to judge according to a very arbitrary standard. A few months after the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
