                <p><label>SAÔNE-ET-LOIRE</label>, a department of east-central France formed from
                    the districts of Autunois, Brionnais, Chalonnais, Charollais and Mâconnais,
                    previously belonging to Burgundy. It is bounded N. by the department of Côte
                    d’Or, E. by that of Jura, S.E. by Ain, S. by Rhône and Loire, W. by Allier and
                    Nièvre. Pop. (1906) 613,377. Area, 3330 sq. m. Of the two rivers from which the
                    department takes its name the Loire forms its south-western boundary, and the
                    Saône traverses its eastern region from north to south. On the left bank of the
                    Saône the department forms part of the wide plain óf Bresse; on its right bank
                    the centre of the department is occupied by the northern Cévennes, here divided
                    by the river Grosne into two parallel ranges—the mountains of Mâconnais to the
                    east, and the mountains of Charollais to the west. The general direction of
                    these ranges is from south, where their altitude is greatest, to north. The
                    north-west region of Saône-et-Loire is occupied by the southern portion of
                    Morvan, which includes the highest point in the department—the Bois du Roi (2959
                    ft.). South-east of the Morvan lies the hilly region of Autunois, consisting of
                    the basin of the Arroux, a right affluent of the Loire, and divided from the
                    Charollais mountains by the Bourbince, a tributary of the Arroux. Besides those
                    mentioned, the chief rivers of the department are the Doubs, which joins the
                    Saône in the extreme north-east, the Seille, also an affluent of the Saône, and
                    the Arconce, a tributary of the Loire watering the Charollais. The average
                    temperature at Mâcon (52° or 53° F.), the most temperate spot in the department,
                    is slightly higher than at Paris, the winter being colder and the summer hotter.
                    At the same town the yearly rainfall is about 33 in., but both the rigour of the
                    climate and the amount of rain increases in the hilly districts, reaching their
                    maximum in the mountains of Morvan.</p>
                <p>Agriculture prospers in Saône-et-Loire. Wheat, oats and maize are the cereals
                    most cultivated ; potatoes, clover and other fodder, and mangold-wurzels are
                    important crops, and beetroot, hemp, colza and rape are also grown. Excellent
                    pasture is found in the valleys of the Saône and other rivers. The vine, one of
                    the principal resources of the department, is cultivated chiefly in the
                    neighbourhood of Chalon and Mâcon. Of the wines of Mâconnais, the vintage of
                    Thorins is in high repute. The white Charollais oxen are one of the finest
                    French breeds; horses, pigs and sheep are reared, and poultry farming is a
                    thriving occupation in the Bresse. The industrial importance of the department
                    is great, chiefly owing to its coal and iron mines; the chief coal mines are
                    those in the vicinity of Creusot, Autun and Chapelle-sous-Dun. A pit at Épinac
                    is over 2600 ft. in depth. Iron is mined at Mazenay and Change, and manganese is
                    found at Romanèche and there are quarries of various kinds. There are well-known
                    warm mineral springs containing chloride of sodium and iron at Bourbon-Lancy.
                    The iron and engineering works of Schneider &amp;amp; Company at Le Creusot are
                    the largest in France. The department also has numerous flour-mills «and
                    distilleries, together with potteries, porcelain-works (Digoin), tile-works,
                    oil-works and glass factories, and carries on various branches of the textile,
                    chemical, leather and wood-working industries. It exports coal, metals,
                    machinery, wine, Charollais cattle, bricks, pottery, glass. Its commerce is
                    facilitated by navigable streams—the Loire, Saône, Doubs and Seille,—the Canal
                    du Centre, which unites Chalon-sur-Saône with Digoin on the Loire, and the canal
                    from Roanne to Digoin and the lateral Loire Canal, both following the main river
                    valley. The chief railway of the department is the Paris-Lyon-Mediterranée.
                    Saône-et-Loire forms the diocese of Autun; it is part of the district of the
                    VIII. army corps (Bourges); its educational centre is Lyons and its court of
                    appeal that of Dijon. It is divided into 5 arrondissements—Mâcon,
                    Chalon-sur-Saône, Autun, Charolles, Louhans—50 cantons, and 589 communes.</p>
                <p>Mâcon, Chalon, Autun, Le Creusot, Cluny, Montceau-Les-Mines, Tournus,
                    Paray-le-Monial, Louhans and Charolles are the most noteworthy towns in the
                    department and receive separate treatment. Other places of interest are St
                    Marcel-lès-Chalon, where there is a Romanesque church, once attached to an abbey
                    where Abélard died; Anzy, which has a Romanesque church and other remains of an
                    important monastery; St Bonnet-de-Joux and Sully, both of which have châteaus of
                    the 16th century; and Semur-en-Brionnais and Varennes-l'Arconce, with fine
                    Romanesque churches. Prehistoric remains of the stone age have been found at
                    Solutré near Mâcon.</p>
