It is ſeated at the foot of a mountain, in a country abounding in good fruits, on the river Guapy. W. Long. 59. 35. S. Lat. 20. 40.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SANTΛ Fe de Bogota,</hi> a town of South America, and capital of New Granada, with an archbiſbop’s ſee, a ſupreme court of juſtice, and an univerſity.</p><p>The city is ſituated at the foot of a ſteep and cold mountain, at the entrance of a vaſt and ſuperb plain. In 1774 it contained 1770 houſes, 3246 families, and 16,233 inhabitants. Population muſt neceſſarily increaſe there, ſince it is the ſeat of government, the place where the coin is ſtricken, the ſtaple of trade; and laſtly, ſince it is the reſidence of an archbiſhop, whoſe immediate juriſdiction extends over 31 Spaniſh villages, which are called towns; over 195 Indian colonies, anciently ſubdued; and over 28 miſſions, eſtabliſhed in modern times. This archbiſhop hath likewiſe, as metropolitan, a fort of inſpection over the dioceſes of Quito, of Panama, of Caraccas, of St Martha, and of Carthagena. It is by this laſt place, though at the diſtance of 100 leagues, and by the river Magdalena, that Santa Fe keeps up its communication with Europe. There are ſilver mines in the mountains about the city. W. Long. 60. 5. N. Lat. 3 58.</p><p>SANTALUM, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the octandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of which the order is doubtful. The calyx is ſuperior; the corolla monopetalous; the ſtamina placed in the tube; the ſtigma is ſimple; the fruit a berry.</p><p>The ſantalum, or ſanders, grows to the ſize of a walnut-tree. Its leaves are entire, oval, and placed oppoſite to each other. Its flower is of one ſingle piece, charged with eight ſtamina, and ſupported upon the piſtil, which becomes an inſipid berry, reſembling in form that of the laurel. Its wood is white in the circumference, and yellow in the centre when the tree is old. This difference of colour conſtitutes two kinds of ſanders, both employed for the ſame purpoſes, and having equally a bitter taſte, and an aromatic ſmell. With the powder of this wood a paſte is prepared, with which the Chineſe, Indians, Perſians, Arabians, and Turks, anoint their bodies. It is likewiſe burnt in their houſes, and yields a fragrant and wholeſome ſmell. The greateſt quantity of this wood, to which a ſharp and attenuating virtue is aſcribed, remains in Tndia. The red ſanders, though in leſs eſtimation, and leſs generally uſed, is ſent by preference into Europe. This is the produce of a different tree, which is common on the coaſt of Coromandel. Some travellers confound it with the wood of Caliatour, which is uſed in dyeing.</p><p>The ſantalum album, or white ſanders, is brought from the Eaſt Indies in billets about the thickneſs of a man’s leg, of a pale whitiſh colour. It is that part of the yellow ſanders wood which lies next the bark. Great part of it, as met with in the ſhops, has no ſmell or taſte, nor any ſenſible quality that can recommend it to the notice of the phyſician.</p><p>The ſantalum album, or yellow ſanders, is the interior part of the wood of the ſame tree which furniſhes the former, is of a pale yellowiſh colour, of a pleaſant ſmell, and a bitteriſh aromatic taſte, accompanied with an agreeable kind of pungency This elegant wood might undoubtedly be applied to valuable medical pur</p><p>poſes, though at preſent very rarely uſed. Diſtilled with water, it yields a fragrant eſſential oil, which thickens in the cold into the conſiſtence of a balſam. Digeſted in pure ſpirit, it imparts a rich yellow tincture; which being committed to diſtillation, the ſpirit ariſes without bringing over any thing conſiderable of the flavour of the ſanders. The reſiduum contains the virtues of ſix times its weight of the wood. Hoffman looks upon this extract as a medicine of ſimilar virtues to ambergris; and recommends it as an excellent reſtorative in great debilities.</p><p>SANTAREN, a handſome town of Portugal in Eſtremadura, ſeated on a mountain near the river Tajo, in a country very fertile in wheat, wine, and oil. They get in their harveſt here two months after they have ſown their corn. It was taken from the Moors in 1447. W. Long. 7. 45. N. Lat. 39. 12.</p><p>SANΓAUGUSTINE. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Augustine.</hi></p><p>SANTEN, a town of Germany, in the circle of Weſtphalia, and in the duchy of Cleves. It has a handſome church belonging to the Roman Catholics, wherein is an image of the Virgin Mary, which they pretend performs a great many miracles. Here the fine walks begin that run as far as Weſel, from which it is five miles diſtant to the north-weſt. E. Long. 6. 33. N. Lat. 51. 38.</p><p>SANTERRE, a ſmall territory of France, in Picardy; bounded on the north by Cambreſis, on the eaſt by Vermandois, on the weft by Amienois, and on the ſouth by the river Somme. It is very fertile, and the capital town is Peronne.</p><p>SANTEUIL, or rather <hi rend="smallcaps">Santeul</hi> (John Baptiſt de), in Latin <hi rend="italic">Santolius Victorinus,</hi> an excellent Latin poet, was born at Paris in 1630. Having finiſhed his ſtudies in Louis the Great’s college, he applied himſelf entirely to poetry, and celebrated in his verſe the praiſes of ſeveral great men; by which he acquired univerſal applauſe. He enriched Paris with a great number of inſcriptions, which are to be ſeen on the public fountains, and the monuments conſecrated to poſterity. At length, ſome new hymns being to be compoſed for the Breviary of Paris, Claude Santeuil his brother, and M. Boſſuet, perſuaded him to undertake that work; and he ſucceeded in it with the greateſt applauſe. On which the order of Clugny defining him to compoſe ſome for their Breviary, he complied with their requeſt; and that order, out of gratitude, granted him letters of filiation, with an annual penſion. Santeuil was careſſed by all the learned men of his time; and had for his admirers the two princes of Condé, the father and ſon, from whom he frequently recieved favours. Louis XIV. alſo gave him a proof of his eſteem, by beſtowing a penſion upon him. He attended the duke of Bourbon to Dijon, when that prince went thither in order to hold the ſtates of Burgundy; and died therein 1697, as he was preparing to return to Paris. Beſides his Latin hymns, he wrote a great number of Latin poems, which have all the fire and marks of genius diſcoverable in the works of great poets.</p><p>To Santeuil we are indebted for many fine church- hymns, as above-mentioned. Santeuil read the verſes he made for the inhabitants of heaven with all the agitations of a demoniac. Deſpreaux ſaid he was the</p></body></text></TEI>
