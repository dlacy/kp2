<p><span class="font1">in character from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Domestic.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domestic Papers </span><span class="font1">relating exclusively to Ireland have been calendared under the&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers, Ireland,</span><span class="font1"> for the years 1509-1601 and 1603-1665,&nbsp;with a special volume dealing with the papers concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adventurers for Land.</span><span class="font1"> From 1670 these papers are calendared in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domestic</span><span class="font1"> volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland.—</span><span class="font1">Originally there were in the State Paper Office two sets of papers relating to Scotland, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Domestic, Border&nbsp;Papers,</span><span class="font1"> containing papers concerning the Council of the North&nbsp;and the Wardens of the Marches; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign, Scotland,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">before the union of the two crowns. The first calendar of these was&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Stale Papers, Scotland, 1509-1603,</span><span class="font1"> containing brief&nbsp;notes of all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign, Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> and of many of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Border Papers</span><span class="font1"> which were removed from their places without any&nbsp;record of the removal. Next came the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of State Papers&nbsp;Foreign,</span><span class="font1"> in which were included apparently all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Border Papers&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for the period covered which had escaped the previous raid;&nbsp;notes, however, were made of the papers so taken. Out of the&nbsp;original 75 volumes of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Border Papers</span><span class="font1"> only 36 remained. At a later&nbsp;date the papers drawn for the Foreign Calendar were restored&nbsp;and now form the first 19 volumes of the series, while the 36 volumes&nbsp;originally remaining have now become the final 23. At the same&nbsp;time the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign, Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> were annexed, and became&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Domestic, Scotland.</span><span class="font1"> In their present arrangement the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Border Papers</span><span class="font1"> have been calendared in the following volumes:&nbsp;vols. 1-19 in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign 1547-1560;</span><span class="font1"> vols. 20-42&nbsp;in the Scottish General Register Office </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Border Papers&nbsp;1560-1603.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Domestic, Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> from 1547 onwards, are being fully calendared in the Scottish General Register&nbsp;Office </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Scottish Papers</span><span class="font1"> with other material. Those&nbsp;from 1509 to 1547 are dealt with in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters and Papers of Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span><span class="font1"> (see below, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special Collections).</span><span class="font1"> A list of these three&nbsp;Classes has been published (No. III.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign.—</span><span class="font1">Calendars of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign</span><span class="font1"> have been published for the period 1547-1580. A few of these papers are&nbsp;also calendared in the first volume of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Spanish&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(see below under </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spain).</span><span class="font1"> The Record Office has published a list&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers Foreign</span><span class="font1"> (No. XIX.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colonial.—</span><span class="font1">These papers are calendared in two sets, an “ East Indies” (1513-1634, which has been continued to 1639 by the&nbsp;India Office in Miss E. B. Sainsbury’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Court Minutes of the East&nbsp;India Company)</span><span class="font1"> and an “ America and West Indies ” (1574-1693,&nbsp;in progress).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Departmental Records.</span><span class="font1">—From time to time all the government departments, with the exception of the Γndia Office, deposit such papers as they wish to preserve in the Public Record Office;&nbsp;thus the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treasury, Home Office, Foreign Office, Colonial Office,&nbsp;Admiralty, War Office, Local Government Board</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Board of Trade&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">have all placed important papers in the care of the Master of the&nbsp;Rolls. A calendar of the earlier Treasury Papers, which extends&nbsp;from 1660 to 1668 and 1720 to 1745 has been published; also a&nbsp;list of the Admiralty Records (No. XVII.). For each department&nbsp;a limiting date is fixed from time to time; documents before that&nbsp;time are open to students; later ones arc only accessible under&nbsp;special conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Subordinate and Independent Jurisdictions.— </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palatinate of Durham.—</span><span class="font1">For the earlier records see G. T. Lapsley’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">County Palatine of Durham</span><span class="font1"> (Harvard Historical Series, vol. viii.), pp. 327-337.&nbsp;The letters sent out from the bishops’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chancery</span><span class="font1"> are enrolled on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cursitors’ Records,</span><span class="font1"> Nοs. 29 to 184. They arc calendared in Reports&nbsp;31 to 37 and 40. One of the registers (Bishop Kellawe’s) has been&nbsp;printed in full in the Rolls scries (No. 62) with additions from the&nbsp;register of Bishop Bury. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cursitors’ Records</span><span class="font1"> also include seven&nbsp;bundles of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions Post Mortem</span><span class="font1"> (Nos. 164-180), calendared in&nbsp;the 44th Report; and a volume (No. 2) contains transcripts of&nbsp;similar documents, calendared in the 45th Report. The records&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exchequer</span><span class="font1"> of Durham, though deposited in the Public Record&nbsp;Office, are treated as the private records of the Ecclesiastical Commission, and are only accessible with a special permit. To the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicial</span><span class="font1"> records the only printed means of reference is the list of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (20 Henry VII. to 7-8 Victoria) in the Record&nbsp;Office list of Plea Rolls (No. IV.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palatinate of Chester.—</span><span class="font1">The letters sent out from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chancery </span><span class="font1">are enrolled upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chester Recognizance</span><span class="font1"> Rolls (1 Edward II. to&nbsp;34 Charles II. with a few rolls down to 1 William IV.) calendared in&nbsp;Reports 36-37 and 39. The financial records of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exchequer&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Chester are listed among the Ministers’ Accounts (List No. V.)&nbsp;of the county of Chester. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions post Mortem</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad&nbsp;quod damnum</span><span class="font1"> (Edward III. to Charles I.) are indexed in the 25th&nbsp;report. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicial</span><span class="font1"> records consist of Pleas in the Exchequer,&nbsp;a court of equity. Its records are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bills and Answers</span><span class="font1"> (Henry VIII.&nbsp;to George IV.), calendared in the 25th Report up to Philip and Mary;&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decrees and Orders.</span><span class="font1"> The court of the justices of Chester was&nbsp;at common law; its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plea Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (44 Henry III. to 1 William IV.),&nbsp;with a separate series for Flint (from 12 Edward I.) are listed among&nbsp;the Plea Rolls (List No. IV.). The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deeds, Inquisitions</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Writs of&nbsp;Dower</span><span class="font1"> upon these rolls for the period Henry III. to Henry VIII.&nbsp;are calendared in the 26th-30th Reports without an index. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Assize Rolls</span><span class="font1"> for the counties of Chester and Flint and for the&nbsp;honour of Macclesfield are listed among the other assize rolls (List&nbsp;No. IV.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wales.—</span><span class="font1">The following are the principal records of the principality of Wales: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ministers’ Accounts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Court Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> including those of the principality and of the honours and manors of the&nbsp;Lords Marchers, listed in Lists Nos. V. and VL Of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicial&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">records of the Great Sessions of Wales, set up by the act 34 &amp; 35&nbsp;Henry VIII., c. 26, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plea Rolls</span><span class="font1"> are listed in the list of Plea Rolls&nbsp;(No. IV). For an account of the Court of the Marches in Wales,&nbsp;see C. A. Skeel's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Council in the Marches of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Duchy and Palatinate of Lancaster.—</span><span class="font1">The duchy of Lancaster comprises all the estates of the duke of Lancaster; the palatinate&nbsp;is limited to the county of Lancaster. The records of the palatinate, transferred to the Public Record Office from Lancaster castle,&nbsp;related to the county and are either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">enrolments of writs</span><span class="font1"> or of a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicial</span><span class="font1"> nature. The records of the duchy, transferred from the&nbsp;office of the duchy at Westminster, include similar records and&nbsp;others dealing with the manorial and financial records of all the&nbsp;estates within and without the county. For the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Duchy Records&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">see the detailed list (No. XIV.), where the means of reference to&nbsp;this collection are fully described. Of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palatinate Records</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;enrolments of writs are classified as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Patent</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Close Rolls.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;former, a broken series from 5 John of Gaunt to 21 Henry VII.,&nbsp;arc calendared in the 40th Report; the latter (in 3 rolls, a broken&nbsp;series, 11</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">Henry IV. to 9 Edward IV.) in the 37th Report; but&nbsp;certain enrolments of the palatinate are among the duchy records.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicial</span><span class="font1"> records of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chancery</span><span class="font1"> are not calendared; but the&nbsp;proceedings by way of appeal from that court to the Duchy&nbsp;Chamber at Westminster are dealt with in the duchy list. Pro-ceedings under common law include </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plea Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (2 Henry IV. to&nbsp;11 Victoria) listed in the list of Plea Rolls (No. IV.) ; and for criminal&nbsp;proceedings there are palatinate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Assize Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (Henry VI. to 6&nbsp;Victoria), of which there is a list in the same place. But certain&nbsp;rolls which were among the Duchy Records will be found apart&nbsp;at pages 139-140 of the same list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bishopric of Ely.—</span><span class="font1">The act 1 &amp; 2 Victoria, c. 94, places the records of this palatinate under the charge of the Master of the Rolls.&nbsp;They have never been removed to the Record Office, but remain&nbsp;at Ely with the episcopal records, where they can be inspected. A valuable descriptive list has been published by Alfred Gibbons&nbsp;for private circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special Collections.</span><span class="font1">—For the classification of the records hitherto described the knowledge preserved of their origin and&nbsp;purpose has been used. There exist, however, masses of records&nbsp;where this path is now inaccessible; these have been formed by&nbsp;putting together records of a similar nature either in ignorance of&nbsp;their history or without regarding it; the justification of this&nbsp;course of action must be found in the special circumstances of&nbsp;each case. These collections are as follows</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ministers’ Accounts</span><span class="font1"> are the accounts of bailiffs, receivers, and other officers managing estates, including, first, those of the duchy&nbsp;of Lancaster; second, accounts of crown lands filed as vouchers&nbsp;in the King’s Remembrancer’s Office; third, accounts of monastiċ&nbsp;and other lands seized by the crown, or acquired by it by purchase;&nbsp;inheritance or marriage. A list of these accounts has been&nbsp;published by the Record Office (Nos. V. and VIII.) covering thd&nbsp;period down to 1485. For the accounts of the duchy of Lancaster&nbsp;a list will be found in the 45th Report, extending to the reign of&nbsp;George III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Court Rolls</span><span class="font1"> are records of the proceedings and profits of manorial and other private courts coming from the same sources as the&nbsp;Ministers’ Accounts, and closely connected with them. For a&nbsp;list see Record Office, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lists and Indexes,</span><span class="font1"> No. VI.; and for specimens&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Pleas in Manorial Courts,</span><span class="font1"> edited for the Selden Society by&nbsp;F. W. Maitland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Deeds.—</span><span class="font1">In this collection are placed all documents which appear to have formed part of a title to land, some original&nbsp;royal charters and other analogous records. There are five series,&nbsp;A, B, C, D, and E, distinguished by their former place of custody.&nbsp;Documents too large for the ordinary method of packing have a&nbsp;double letter, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> A.A., and to those bearing fine seals the letter&nbsp;S is added, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> AS or AAS. There arc thus in all fifteen classes.&nbsp;The A classes are derived from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treasury of Receipt,</span><span class="font1"> or Chapter&nbsp;House at Westminster, and are largely monastic; the B classes&nbsp;arc from the court of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Augmentations∙,</span><span class="font1"> the C classes are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chancery&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">deeds, probably deposited as exhibits in suits or for enrolments;&nbsp;the D classes are from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">King’s Remembrancer’s</span><span class="font1"> office; and the&nbsp;E classes are from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Land Revenue</span><span class="font1"> office. In 1907 five volumes&nbsp;of a descriptive catalogue had been published by the Record Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Correspondence</span><span class="font1"> consists of documents which in form are rather of the nature of a letter than a writ or petition. Most of&nbsp;them were found detached in the chancery records, but similar&nbsp;documents from other sources have been added. The introduction to the Record Office List (No. XV.) contains some account&nbsp;of the formation of the class, and the list gives references to&nbsp;printed collections based upon these documents. Vol. 53 contains letters of the Cely Family and is published (Camden Society,&nbsp;3rd series, vol. i.).</span></p>
