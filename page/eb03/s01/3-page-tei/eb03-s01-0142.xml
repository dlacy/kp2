            <p>ſician Avicenna. He publiſhed the whole works of Ariſtotle, with notes, and affected
                much to reaſon on the principles of that great philoſopher. He wrote a book
                concerning <hi rend="italic">The Secrets oſ Nature,</hi> in which he treats of
                generation, phyſiognomy, and the ſigns by which we judge of the temperaments of men
                and women. We have alſo a tract of his <hi rend="italic">On the Nature oſ the Sun
                    and Moon.</hi> He there ſpeaks of the <hi rend="italic">grand operation, </hi>as
                it is termed by alchymiſts, and is exceedingly ſolicitous about the <hi

                    done.</hi> He likewiſe publiſhed what he calls <hi rend="italic">Mensa
                    Philoſophica,</hi> a treatiſe replete with aſtrology and chiromancy. He was much
                admired in his day, and was even ſnſpectcd oſ magic; and had Roger Bacon and
                Cornelius Agrippa for his panegyriſts.</p>

                was the younger ſon of Sir John Scot of Scot’s-hall, near Smeethe in Kent. He
                ſtudied at Hart-hall in the univerſity of Oxford; after which he retired to Smeethe,
                where he lived a ſtudious life, and died in 1599. He publiſhed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The perfect Platform oſ a Hοp-garden;</hi> and a book intitled, The <hi
                    rend="italic">Diſcovery of Witchcraft;</hi> in which he ſhowed that all the
                relations concerning magicians and witches are chimerical. This work was not only
                cenſured by king James I. in his <hi rend="italic">Daemonology,</hi> but by ſeveral

                an ale-houſe within the foreſt, by colour of his office, making people come to his
                houſe, and there ſpend their money for fear of his diſpleaſure. We find it mentioned
                in the charter of the foreſt, cap. 8. Nullus forreſtarius faciat <hi rend="italic"

                <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Scotland,</hi> one of the Britiſh feulements in North
                America, ſituated between 43⁰and 49° north latitude, and between 60⁰ and 67⁰ weſt
                longitude, is bounded by the river St Laurence on the north; by the gulph of St
                Laurence and the Atlantic ocean on the eaſt; by the ſame ocean on the ſouth; and by
                Canada and New England on the weſt. —In the year 1784, this province was divided
                into two governments. The province and government now ſtyled New <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brunſwick</hi> is bounded on the weſtward of the mouth of the river St Croix,
                by the ſaid river to its ſource, and by a line drawn due north from thence to the
                ſouthern boundary of the province of Quebec, to the northward by the ſaid boundary
                as far as the weſtern extremity of the Bay de Chaleurs, to the eaſtward by the ſaid
                bay to the gulph of St Laurence to the bay called <hi rend="italic">Bay Verte,</hi>
                to the ſouth by a line in the centre of the Bay of Fundy, from the river St Croix
                aforeſaid, to the mouth of the Muſquat river, by the ſaid river to its ſource, and
                from thence by a due eaſt line acroſs the Iſthmus into the Bay Verte, to join the
                eaſtern lot above deſcribed, including all iſlands within fix leagues of the
                coaſt.</p>
            <p>The chief rivers are, the river of St Laurence, which forms the northern boundary.
                The rivers Riſgouche and Nipiſiguit run from weſt to eaſt, and fall into the bay of
                St Laurence. The rivers of St John, Paſſamagnadi, Penobſcot and St Croix, which run
                from</p>
            <p>north to ſouth, fall into Fundy Bay, or the ſea a little
                to the eaſtward oſ it</p>
            <p>The ſeas adjoining to it are, the Atlantic ocean, Fundy Bay, and the gulph of St
                Laurence. The leſſer bays are, Chenigto and Green Bay upon the iſthmus which joins
                the north part of Nova Scotia to the ſouth; and the Bay of Chaleurs on the
                north-eaſt; the Bay of Chedibucto on the ſouth-eaſt; the Bay of the Iſlands, the
                Ports of Bart, Chebucto, Proſper, St Margaret, La Heve, port Maltois, port Ryſignol,
                port Vert, and port Joly, on the ſouth; port La Tour on the ſouth-eaſt; port St
                Mary, Anapolis, and Minas on the ſouth ſide of Fundy Bay, and port Roſeway, now the
                moſt populous of all. — The chief capes are, Cape Portage, Ecoumenac, Tourmentin,
                Cape Port, and Epis, on the eaſt; Cape Fogerie and Cape Canceau on the ſouth-eaſt
                Cape Blanco, Cape Vert, Cape Theodore, Cape Dore, Cape La Heve, and Cape Negro, on
                the ſouth; Cape Sable and Cape Fourche on the ſouth-weſt. —The lakes are very
                numerous, but have not yet received particular names.</p>
            <p>The face of the country, when viewed at a diſtance, preſents a pleaſingly variegated
                appearance of hills and valleys, with ſcarcely any thing like mountains to interrupt
                the proſpect, eſpecially near the ſea. A nearer approach diſcovers thoſe ſublime and
                beautiful ſcenes which are ſo far ſuperior to the gaudy embelliſhments of art.
                Immenſe foreſts, formed of the talleſt trees, the growth of ages, and reaching
                almoſt to the clouds, everywhere cover and adorn the land: Their leaves falling in
                autumn, add continually to that cruſt of moſs, vegetables, and decaying wood, that
                has for many centuries been accumulating; whilſt the rays of the ſun, unable to
                pierce the thick ſhade which everywhere covers the ground, leaves it in a perpetual
                ſtate of damp and rottenneſs; a circumſtance which contributes, in no ſmall degree,
                to increaſe the ſharpneſs of the air in winter.</p>
            <p>The clouds, flying over the higher grounds, which are covered in every direction with
                one vaſt foreſt, and arreſted by the attraction of the woods, fill the country with
                water. Every rock has a ſpring, and every ſpring cauſes a ſwamp or moraſs, oſ
                greater or leſs extent in proportion to its cauſe: hence it is, that travelling
                becomes almoſt impracticable in ſummer, and is ſeldom attempted, but in the fall of
                the year, when winter begins to ſet in, and the ground is already frozen.</p>
            <p>The land throughout the peninſula is in no part mountainous, but frequently riſes
                into hills of gradual aſcent, everywhere clothed with wood. From theſe ariſe
                innumerable ſprings and rivulets, which not only fertilize and adorn the country,
                but have formed, in the midſt of it, a large lake or piece of freſh water, which is
                of various depths, and of which, however, little more is known, than that it has
                upon its borders very large tracts of meadow-land highly improveable. That part of
                the province which is beyond the Bay of Fundy, and extends to the river St Laurence,
                riſes alſo gradually as we advance from the ſea quite to Canada, but is, however,
                hardly anywhere mountainous. Its lands are for the moſt part very rich, particularly
                at a diſtance from the ſea; and its woods abound with the hardeſt and loftieſt
                trees.</p>
            <p>Though this country, like Canada, is ſubject to long</p>
