<p><span class="font1">ment, to </span><span class="font0">which he ſubjoined an abſtract of his pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruddiman next engaged in the management of a newſpaper, an employment for which his genius and in-duſtry ſeemed to render him well qualified. But thoſe&nbsp;'who ſhould expect either much information or amuſe-ment from this publication, would perhaps be greatly&nbsp;diſappointed. The newſpaper wſhich he conducted was&nbsp;the Caledonian Mercury, and was eſtabliſhed in 1720&nbsp;by William Rolland a lawyer^ Ruddiman acted only in&nbsp;'the capacity of printer for five years ; but upon the&nbsp;death of Mr Rolland in 1729, the property was tranf-'ferred to him, or to his brother Walter and him con·&nbsp;'junctly. This paper continued in the family of Ruddi-^man till the year 1772, when it was ſold by the truſ-■tees of his grandchildren to Mr John Robertſon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Caledonian Mercury was at firſt printed three times a week, on Monday, ſueſday, and Thurſday, in&nbsp;a ſmall 4t0 of four pages, with two columns in each&nbsp;page, and 50 lines in each column ; ſo that the whole&nbsp;paper contained only 400 lines. It now contains in its&nbsp;folio ſize 2480 lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ruddiman, after the death of Mr Spottiſwoode librarian, remained for ſome time in his former ſtation ;&nbsp;but was at length appointed keeper of the library, tho’&nbsp;without any increaſe oſ ſalary; and ſome years after Mr&nbsp;Goodal, the defender of Queen Mary, ſucceeded him&nbsp;in the office of ſub-librarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The aſſiduous application of Ruddiman, ſupported by ſuch learning, was intitled to wealth, which now indeed&nbsp;flowed upon him in what was at that period deemed&nbsp;great abundance. On the iſt of October i735, it appeared from an exact ſtatement oſ his affairs, that he&nbsp;was worth L. 1882 : 5 : 2 Sterling ; and on the 20th&nbsp;■of May, the enſuing year, his wealth had increaſed to&nbsp;L. 1985 : 6 : 3 Sterling. In 1710 he valued his effects&nbsp;at L. 24 : 14 : 9 Sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1737 the ſchoolmaſters and teachers in Edinburgh formed themſelves into a ſociety, in order to eſtabliſh&nbsp;a fund for the ſupport of their wives and children.&nbsp;Of this ſcheme Ruddiman was an active promoter, and&nbsp;was choſen treaſurer. Perhaps it was this aſſociation&nbsp;which in 1742 gave the idea to the Scots clergy of&nbsp;forming their widows fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1739 he publiſhed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seleftus Diplomatum et Num'f-inatum Scotiæ Theſaurus.</span><span class="font0"> This work was projected and begun by Anderſon (hence called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anderſon’s Diploma-ta),</span><span class="font0"> but was finiſhed by Ruddiman. The preface,&nbsp;which is an excellent commentary on Anderſon’s performance, was written by Ruddiman, and diſplays a&nbsp;greater extent of knowledge than any of his other productions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Ruddiman had imbibed from his father thoſe political principles which attached him to the family of Stuart, he probably did not remain an unconcerned&nbsp;ſpectator of the civil commotions which in τ 745 agitated Scotland. He did not, however, take any active&nbsp;part in the rebellion. His principles, he has been heard&nbsp;to ſay, induced him to be a quiet ſubject and a good citizen. He retired to the country during the ſummer&nbsp;of 1745&quot; ; and while his fellow-citizens were ſpilling each&nbsp;ethers blood, he was more happily engaged in writing&nbsp;Critical Obſervations on Burman’s Commentaries on&nbsp;Lucan’s Pharſalia. The Caledonian Mercury was in&nbsp;the mean time marked with a jealous eye. His ſon,&nbsp;who had for ſome time been the principal manager of&nbsp;that newſpaper, having copied a paragraph which was&nbsp;reckoned ſeditious from an Engliſh paper, was impri∙&nbsp;ſoned. The ſolicitation of his father procured his re-leaſe : but it was too late ; for the unhappy young man&nbsp;had contracted a diſtemper in the tolbooth of Edinburgh&nbsp;which brought him to his grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the laſt ſeventeen years of his life Ruddiman was almoſt inceſſantly engaged in controverſy. To this&nbsp;he w<sup>τ</sup>as in ſome meaſure compelled by the violent attacks which ſome critics of the times had ſucceſſively&nbsp;made upon his works. He was firſt called upon by&nbsp;Benſon, auditor in the exchequer, to determine the&nbsp;comparative merit of Buchanan and Johnſton as poets.&nbsp;He gave a decided preference to Buchanan in perſpi-cuity, purity, and variety of ſtyle ;■ but, like a candid&nbsp;critic, allowed Johnſton to be ſuperior in the harmony&nbsp;of his numbers. His next antagoniſt was Logan, one&nbsp;of the miniſters of Edinburgh, a weak illiterate man,&nbsp;but an obſtinate polemic. The ſubject of conteſt was,&nbsp;whether the crown of Scotland was ſtrictly hereditary,&nbsp;and whether the birth of Robert III. was legitimate ?&nbsp;Ruddiman maintained the affirmative in both pointe,&nbsp;and certainly far ſurpaſſed his antagoniſt in the powers of&nbsp;reaſoning. He proved the legitimacy of Robert by the&nbsp;public records of the kingdom with a force of argument&nbsp;which admits of no reply ; but in diſcuſſing the firſt&nbsp;queſtion (by which he was led to confider the conteſt&nbsp;between Bruce and Baliol) he was not ſo ſucceſsful :&nbsp;for there are many inſtances in the hiſtory of Scotland&nbsp;in whjch the brother ſucceeded to the crown in preference to the ſon. He ſhowed, however, that the Scottiſh crown was at no period properly elective; and that,&nbsp;according to the old licentious conſtitution of the kingdom, the right of Bruce, who was the neareſt in blood&nbsp;to the royal ſtock, was preferable to the claim of Baliol&nbsp;though deſcended ſrom the eldeſt daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the labours of Ruddiman did not end when the pen dropt from the feeble hand of Logan. He was&nbsp;ſoon called upon to repel the attacks of Love ſchool-maſter of Dalkeith, who maintained, in oppoſition to&nbsp;him, that Buchanan had neither repented of his treatment oſ Queen Mary, nor had been guilty of ingratitude&nbsp;to that prmceſs. That Buchanan ever repented there&nbsp;is reaſon to doubt. Whether he was guilty of ingratitude, let the unbiaſſed determine, when they are aſſu-red by authentic records that Mary conferred on him a&nbsp;penſion for life of 500 pounds.Scots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Ruddiman had arrived at his eightieth year, and was almoſt blind, he was aſſailed by James Man,&nbsp;mailer of an hoſpital at Aberdeen, with a degree of rancour and virulence, united with ſome learning and ability, which muſt have touched him in a ſenſible manner,&nbsp;and alarmed his fears for his reputation after his deceaſe. He was called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fimjhed pedant,</span><span class="font0"> a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">furious calumniator,</span><span class="font0"> and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corrupter of Buchanan's works.</span><span class="font0"> The venerable old man again put on his armour, entered the&nbsp;lifts, and gained a complete victory. Man, with all his&nbsp;acuteneſs, could only point out twenty errors in two&nbsp;folio volμmes. Some of theſe were typographical, ſome&nbsp;trifling, and ſome doubtful. Ruddiman, with much&nbsp;pleaſantry, drew up againſt Man an account of 469 errors, conſiſting of 14 articles, </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">wſhich two or three&nbsp;may<sup>r</sup> be produced as a ſpecimen. 1. Falſehoods and prevarications, </span><span class="font1">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </span><span class="font0">Abſurdities, 69.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">3.
