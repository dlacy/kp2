                class="font2"> Gom., an apocynaceous tree common on the S. American&nbsp;plateau in
                Brazil from Pernambuco to Rio de Janeiro, at a height of&nbsp;3000 to 5000 ft. above
                the sea. It is about the size of an ordinary&nbsp;apple tree, with small leaves like
                the willow, and a drooping habit&nbsp;like a weeping birch, and has an edible fruit
                like a yellow plum called&nbsp;“ mangaba,” for which, rather than for the rubber,
                the tree is&nbsp;cultivated in some districts. Only a small quantity of this
                rubber&nbsp;comes to England, and it is not much valued, being a “ wet ”
                rubber.&nbsp;It is produced in “ biscuits ” or “ sheets.” The caoutchouc
                is&nbsp;collected in the following manner: about eight oblique cuts are&nbsp;made
                all round the trunk, but only through the bark, and a tin&nbsp;cup is fastened at
                the bottom of each incision by means </span><span class="font1">of </span><span
                class="font2">a piece of&nbsp;soft clay. The cups when full are poured into a larger
                vessel, and&nbsp;solution </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2"
                >alum is added to coagulate the latex. In two or three&nbsp;minutes coagulation
                takes place, and the rubber is then exposed to&nbsp;the air on sticks, and allowed
                to drain for eight days. About thirty&nbsp;days afterwards it is sent to market.
                Pernambuco rubber, as is&nbsp;the case with most rubbers coagulated by saline
                solutions, contains a large quantity of water. The tree has been planted
                in&nbsp;other countries, but has so far not received much attention. It&nbsp;will
                grow on a dry sandy soil, dislikes much moisture, and needs&nbsp;no
            shade.</span></p>

                Imperial Institute, and many of the authentic&nbsp;specimens have been chemically
                and technically examined in the&nbsp;Scientific and Technical Department of the
                Institute and commercially valued. Reports on many of the lesser known
                rubbers&nbsp;have been published in the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin of the Imperial Institute.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry of Rubber.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Rubber is chiefly composed of the soft, solid, elastic substance
                known as caoutchouc. It is usually assumed that this substance is&nbsp;present as
                such in the latex. The globules in the latex, however,&nbsp;consist more probably of
                a distinct liquid substance which readily&nbsp;changes into the solid caoutchouc.
                The coagulation of the latex&nbsp;often originates with the “ curding ” of the
                proteids present, and this&nbsp;alteration in the proteid leads to the
                solidification of the globules&nbsp;into caoutchouc. The latter, however, is
                probably a distinct effect.&nbsp;Under certain conditions, as when latex is allowed
                to stand or is&nbsp;centrifugalized, a cream is obtained consisting of the liquid
                globules,&nbsp;which may be washed free from proteid without change, but,
                either&nbsp;by mechanical agitation or by the addition of acid or other
                chemical&nbsp;agent, the liquid gradually solidifies to a mass of solid
                caoutchouc.&nbsp;The phenomenon therefore resembles the change known to
                the&nbsp;chemist as polymerization, by which through molecular aggregation&nbsp;a
                liquid may pass into a solid without change in its empirical composition. The effect
                may, however, also be due to chemical change&nbsp;known as condensation, and be
                accompanied by the elimination&nbsp;of the elements of water. So far the chemical
                nature of the liquid&nbsp;globules of the latex is unknown, and the exact character
                of the&nbsp;change into solid caoutchouc remains to be determined. The&nbsp;watery
                liquid known as rubber milk or latex is an emulsion consisting chiefly of a weak
                watery solution of proteids, carbohydrates&nbsp;and salts holding the liquid
                globules in suspension. In connexion&nbsp;with the production of rubber the most
                important factor is the&nbsp;proportion of caoutchouc it contains. In a good rubber
                this ranges&nbsp;from 70-90% and over. The proportion and nature of the
                proteids&nbsp;or albuminous materials vanes considerably in different
                Iatices.&nbsp;The proteids should be as far as possible removed during the
                preparation of the rubber, as these substances arc chiefly responsible&nbsp;for the
                objectionable smell and colour of “ native ” rubbers, and&nbsp;their presence leads
                to subsequent change in the commercial material.&nbsp;All crude rubber contains more
                or less proteid, and in the opinion&nbsp;of some technical experts its presence even
                affords strength to the&nbsp;material, but this cannot be accepted as proved.* The
                dissolved&nbsp;salts (potassium, sodium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium,
                &amp;c.)&nbsp;of the latex are generally nearly entirely absent from the
                well-prepared rubber. Of considerable importance to the value of the&nbsp;rubber is
                the absence of the resinous constituents which are present&nbsp;in greater or
                smaller proportion in all latices. The presence of more&nbsp;than a small percentage
                of resin in the latex leads to the production&nbsp;of rubber containing much resin,
                which seriously depreciates its&nbsp;commercial value for most purposes. The
                percentage of resin in a&nbsp;good rubber should be as small as possible, and should
                in any case&nbsp;be less than 10%. There is no feasible method at present
                known&nbsp;of preventing the inclusion of the resin of the latex with the.
                rubber&nbsp;during coagulation, and although the separation of the resin
                from&nbsp;the solid caoutchouc by means of solvents is possible, it is
                not&nbsp;practicable or profitable commercially. A complete examination&nbsp;of a
                series of different latices has shown that, in many cases, </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;Hevea</span><span class="font2">
                and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa,</span><span
                class="font2"> the resin is present in large proportion in the&nbsp;latex derived
                from young trees, and diminishes in amount as the&nbsp;tree </span><span
                class="font1">ages. </span><span class="font2">This is one reason why young trees
                should not be tapped.&nbsp;The composition of latex and of typical rubbers is given

        <p><span class="font2">The chemical analysis of crude rubber is an important guide to its
                value. At present, however, the methods of analysis usually&nbsp;employed are not
                sufficiently delicate to afford all the necessary&nbsp;information as to the
                intrinsic value of the higher grades of rubber,&nbsp;and do not go much beyond the
                exclusion of inferior rubber. The&nbsp;tests of the physical properties of crude
                rubber usually applied to&nbsp;determine its value in the market are also very rough
                and cannot&nbsp;be relied upon. The development of the rubber industry, has
                now&nbsp;reached a stage at which more exact methods of determining
                the&nbsp;chemical composition and physical properties (strength and elasticity) of
                rubber are required. At present the caoutchouc present&nbsp;in crude rubber is
                usually estimated indirectly, and it is possible&nbsp;that what generally passes as
                caoutchouc may be. in some instances&nbsp;a mixture of similar chemical substances,
                which if separated would&nbsp;be found to differ in those physical properties on
                which the technical&nbsp;value of rubber depends.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It is already certain that some commercial rubbers contain a variable
                proportion of a substance of the nature of caoutchouc,&nbsp;but having different
                properties.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">True caoutchouc, the principal constituent of all rubbers, is
                probably essentially one and the same substance, from whatever&nbsp;botanical source
                it may have been derived. This is an elastic&nbsp;solid, almost transparent in thin
                sheets, composed entirely of carbon&nbsp;and hydrogen, the empirical composition of
                which is represented by</span></p>
