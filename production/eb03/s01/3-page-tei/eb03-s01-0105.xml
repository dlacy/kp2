The ſucceeding campaigns gained him additional honours. After the victory of Raucoux, which he gained on the 11th October 1746, the king of France made him a preſent of fix pieces of cannon. He was, on the 12th of January of the following year, created marechal of all the French armies, and, in 1748, commander-general of all thoſe parts of the Netherlands which were lately conquered.</p><p>Holland now began to tremble for her ſafety. Maeſtricht and Bergen-op-Zoom had already fallen, and nothing but misfortunes ſeemed to attend the further proſecution oſ the war. The States General, therefore, offered terms of peace, which were accepted, and a treaty concluded on the 18th October 1748.</p><p>Marechal Saxe retired to Chambord, a country ſeat which the king of France had given him. Some time after he went to Berlin, where the king of Pruſſia received him as Alexander would have received Caeſar. — On his return to France, he ſpent his time among men of learning, artiſts, and philoſophers. He died of a fever, on the 30th November 1750, at the age of 54.</p><p>Some days before his death, talking to M. Senac his phyſician about his life, “It has been (ſays he) an excellent dream. ” He was remarkably careful of the lives of his men. One day a general officer was pointing out to him a poſt which would have been of great uſe. “It will only coſt you (ſays he) a dozen grenadiers. “That would do very well, ” replied the marechal, “were it only a dozen lieutenant-generals. ”</p><p>It was impoſſible for marechal Saxe, the natural brother of the king of Poland, elected ſovereign of Courland, and poſſeſſed of a vigorous and reſtleſs imagination, to be deſtitute of ambition. He conſtantly entertained the notion that he would be a king. After loſing the crown of Ruſſia by his inconſtancy in love, he formed, it is ſaid, the project of aſſembling the Jews, and of being the ſovereign of a nation which for 1700 years had neither poſſeſſed chief nor country. When this chimerical idea could not be realized, he caſt his eyes upon the kingdom of Corſica. After failing in this project alſo, he was buſily employed in planning a ſettlement in ſome part of America, particularly Brazil, when death ſurpriſed him.</p><p>He had been educated and died in the Lutheran religion. “It is a pity (ſaid the queen of France, when file heard of his death) that we cannot ſay a ſingle <hi rend="italic">De proſundis (prayer for the dead)</hi> for a man who has made us ſing ſo many <hi rend="italic">Te Deums”</hi> All France lamented his death.</p><p>By his will, which is dated at Paris, March 1. 1748, he directed that his body ſhould be buried in quicklime: “that nothing (ſays he) may remain of me in this world but the remembrance of me among my friends. ” Theſe orders, however, were not complied with; for his body was embalmed, put into a leaden coffin, which was incloſed in another of copper, and this covered  with one of wood, bound about with iron. His heart was put into a ſilver gilt box, and his entrails into another coffin. Louis XV. was at the charge of his funeral. By his order his corpſe was interred with great pomp and ſplendor in the Lutheran church of St Thomas, at Straſhurgh, on the 8th February 1751.</p><p>The marechal was a man of ordinary ſtature, of a robuſt conſtitution, and extraordinary ſtrength. To</p><p>an aſpect, noble, warlike, and mild, he joined the excellent qualities of the heart. Affable in his manners, and diſpoſed to ſympathize with the unfortunate, his generoſity ſometimes carried him beyond the limits of his fortune. On his death-bed he reviewed the errors of his life with remorſe, and expreſſed much penitence.</p><p>The beſt edition of his Reveries was printed at Paris 1757, in 2 vols 4to. It was compared with the greateſt attention with the original manuſcript in the king’s library. It is accompanied with many deſigns exactly engraved, and a Life of the Author. The Life of marechal Saxe was written by M. d’ Eſpagnac, 2 vols.</p><p>12mo. This hiſtory is written in the panegyrical ſtyle. The author is, however, impartial enough to remark, that in the three battles upon which the reputation of marechal Saxe is founded, he engaged in the molt favourable circumſtances, "Never did a general (ſays he) ſtand in a more advantageous ſituation. Honoured with the confidence of the king, he was not reſtrained in any of his projects. He always commanded a numerous army: his ſoldiers were ſteady, and his officers poſſeſſed great merit. ”</p><p>SAXIFRAGA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Saxifrage,</hi> in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the  13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulenta.</hi> The calyx is quinquepartite; the corolla pentapetalous; the capſule biroſtrated, unilocular, and polyſpermous.</p><p>There are 38 ſpecies  oſ which the moſt remarkable are, 1. The granulata, or white ſaxifrage, which grows naturally in the meadows in many parts of England. The roots of this plant are like grains of corn, of a reddiſh colour without; from which ariſe kidney-ſhaped hairy leaves, ſtanding upon pretty long footſtalks. — The ſtalks are thick, a foot high, hairy, and furrowed: theſe branch out ſrom the bottom, and have a few ſmall leaves like thoſe below, which fit cloſe to the ſtalk: the flowers terminate the ſtalk, growing in ſmall cluſters; they have five white petals, incloſing ten ſtamina and the two ſtyles. There is a variety of this with double flowers, which is very ornamental. 2. The pyramidata, with a pyramidal ſtalk, grows naturally on the mountains of Italy. The leaves are tongue-ſhaped, gathered into heads, rounded at their points, and have cartilaginous and ſawed borders. The ſtalk riſes two feet and a half high, branching out near the ground, forming a natural pyramid to the top. The flowers have five white wedge-ſhaped petals, and ten ſtamina, placed circularly the length of the tube, terminated by roundiſh purple ſummits. When theſe plants are ſtrong, they produce very large pyramids of flowers, which make a fine appearance. 3. The punctata, commonly called <hi rend="italic">London pride,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">none-ſo-pretty,</hi> grows naturally on the Alps, and alſo in great plenty on a mountain of Ireland called <hi rend="italic">Mangerton,</hi> in the county of Kerry in that iſland. The roots of this are perennial; the leaves are oblong, oval, and placed circularly at bottom. They have broad, flat, furrowed foot-ſtalks, and are deeply crenated at their edges, which are white. The ſtalk riſes a foot high, is of a purple colour, ſtiff, ſlender, and hairy. It fends out from the fide on the upper part ſeveral ſhort foot-ſtalks, which are terminated by white flowers ſpotted with red. 4. The oppofitifolia, grows natural-</p></body></text></TEI>
