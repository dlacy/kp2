<p><span class="font0">dignitary of the court, and is always a member of the Government of the day, a peer, and a privy councillor. All matters connected with the horses and hounds of the sovereign are within&nbsp;his jurisdiction. The master of the buckhounds, who is also one&nbsp;of the ministry, ranks next to him, and it is his duty.to attend the&nbsp;royalhunt and to head the procession of royal equipages on the&nbsp;racecourse at Ascot, where he presents himself on horseback in a&nbsp;green and gold uniform wearing the couples of a hound as the&nbsp;badge of his office. The hereditary grand falconer@@<sup>1</sup> is also subordinated to the master of the horse. But the practical management of the royal stables and stud in fact devolves on the chief or&nbsp;crown equerry, formerly called the gentleman of the horse, who is&nbsp;never in personal attendance on the sovereign, and whose appointment is permanent. The clerk marshal has the supervision of the&nbsp;accounts of the department before they are submitted to the Board&nbsp;of Green Cloth, and is in waiting on the sovereign on state occasions&nbsp;only. Exclusive of the crown equerry there are seven regular&nbsp;equerries, besides extra and honorary equerries, one of whom is&nbsp;always in attendance on the sovereign and rides at the side of&nbsp;the royal carriage. They are always officers of the army, and each&nbsp;of them is “on duty” for about the same time as the lords and&nbsp;grooms in waiting. There are also three pages of honour in the&nbsp;master of the horse’s department, who must not be confounded&nbsp;with tho pages of various κinds who are in the department of the&nbsp;lord chamberlain. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen,&nbsp;selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on her at state&nbsp;ceremonies, when two of them arrayed in an antique costume assist&nbsp;the groom of the robes in carrying the royal train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It remains to be said that to the three ancient departments of the royal household which we have already noticed two others have&nbsp;been added in comparatively recent times. The departments of the&nbsp;private secretary and the keeper of the privy purse to the sovereign,&nbsp;which are for the present combined, originated no longer ago than&nbsp;the earlier part of the current century. Very great doubts were at&nbsp;one time entertained as to whether such an office as that of private&nbsp;secretary to the sovereign could constitutionally exist, and the&nbsp;privy purse itself was unknown until after the passing of Burke’s&nbsp;Act of 1782. As at present organized these branches of the royal&nbsp;household consist of the private secretary and keeper of the privy&nbsp;purse, two assistant private secretaries and keepers of the privy&nbsp;purse, aud a secretary and two clerks of the privy purse. By the&nbsp;statute which settled the civil list at the beginning of the current&nbsp;reign (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 2) the privy purse was fixed at £60,000 a year,&nbsp;am I the salaries, allowances, and other expenses of the royal household were fixed at £303,760 a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F.

<p><span class="font1">ROYAL SOCIETY, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The,</span><span class="font1"> or, more fully, The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, is&nbsp;an association of men interested in the advancement of&nbsp;mathematical and physical science. It is the oldest scientific society in Great Britain, and one of the oldest in&nbsp;Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Royal Society is usually considered to have been founded in the year 1660, but a nucleus had in fact been&nbsp;in existence for some years before that date. Wallis&nbsp;informs us that as early as the year· 1645 weekly meetings&nbsp;were held of “divers worthy persons, inquisitive into&nbsp;natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning,&nbsp;and particularly of what hath been called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New Philosophy</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Experimental Philosophy”</span><span class="font1"> and there can be little&nbsp;doubt that this gathering of philosophers is identical with&nbsp;the “ Invisible College ” of which Boyle speaks in sundry&nbsp;letters written in 1646 and 1647. These weekly meetings, according to Wallis, were first suggested by Theodore&nbsp;Ilaak, “a German of the Palatinate then resident in&nbsp;London,” and they were held sometimes in Dr Goddard’s&nbsp;lodgings in Wood Street, sometimes at the Bull-Head&nbsp;Tavern in Cheapside, but more often at Gresham College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On November 28, 1660, the first journal book of the society was opened with a “ memorandum,” from which the&nbsp;following is an extract :—“ Memorandum that Novemb.&nbsp;28. 1660, These persons following, according to the usuall&nbsp;custom of most of them, mett together at Gresham Colledge&nbsp;to heare Mr Wren’s lecture, viz., The Lord Brouncker, Mr&nbsp;Boyle, Mr Bruce, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paul Neile, Dr&nbsp;Wilkins, Dr Goddard, Dr Petty, Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr&nbsp;Wren, Mr Hill. And after the lecture was ended, they&nbsp;did, according to the usuall manner withdrawe for mutuall</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The duke of St Albans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">converse. MTiere amongst other matters that were discoursed of, something was offered about a désigné of founding a Colledge for the promoting of Physico-Mathe-maticall Experimentall Learning.” It was agreed at this&nbsp;meeting that the company should continue to assemble on&nbsp;Wednesdays at 3 o’clock; an admission fee of ten shillings&nbsp;with a subscription of one shilling a week was instituted;&nbsp;Dr Wilkins was appointed chairman ; and a list of forty-one&nbsp;persons judged likely and fit to join the design was drawn&nbsp;up. On the following Wednesday Sir Robert Moray brought&nbsp;word that the king (Charles II.) approved the design of&nbsp;the meetings ; a form of obligation was framed, and was&nbsp;signed by all the persons enumerated in the memorandum&nbsp;of November 28, and by seventy-three others. On&nbsp;December 12 another meeting was held at which fifty-five&nbsp;was fixed as the number of the society,—persons of the&nbsp;degree of baron, fellows of the College of Physicians, and&nbsp;public professors of mathematics, physic, and natural&nbsp;philosophy of both universities being supernumeraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gresham College’ was now appointed to be the regular meeting-place of the society. Sir Robert Moray was chosen&nbsp;president (March 6, 1661), and continued in that office&nbsp;until the incorporation of the society, when he was succeeded by Lord Brouncker. Iu October 1661 the king&nbsp;offered to be entered one of the society, and next year the&nbsp;society was incorporated under the name of “ The Royal&nbsp;Society,” the charter of incorporation passing the great&nbsp;seal on the 15th July 1662, to be modified, however, by&nbsp;a second charter in the following year. The council of&nbsp;the Royal Society met for the first time on May 13, 1663,&nbsp;when resolutions were passed that debate concerning those&nbsp;to be admitted should be secret, and that fellows should&nbsp;pay Is. a week to defray expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At this early stage of the society’s history one main part of their labours was the “correspondence” which&nbsp;was actively maintained with Continental philosophers,&nbsp;and it was from this that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(a publication now of world-wide celebrity) took its rise.&nbsp;At first the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font1"> was entirely the work of the&nbsp;secretary, except that it was ordered (March 1, 1664-5)&nbsp;“ that the tract be licensed by the Council of the Society,&nbsp;being first reviewed by some of the members of the same.”&nbsp;The first number, consisting of sixteen quarto pages,&nbsp;appeared on Monday 6th March 1664-5. In 1750 four&nbsp;hundred and ninety-six numbers or forty-six volumes had&nbsp;been published by the secretaries. After this date the&nbsp;work was issued under the superintendence of a committee,&nbsp;and the division into numbers disappeared. At present&nbsp;(1885) one hundred and seventy-five volumes have been&nbsp;completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another matter to which the society turned their attention was the formation of a museum, the nucleus being “the collection of rarities formerly belonging to Mr&nbsp;Hubbard,” which, by a resolution of council passed&nbsp;February 21, 1666, was purchased for the sum of £100.&nbsp;This museum, at one time the most famous in London,&nbsp;was presented to the trustees of the British Museum in&nbsp;1781, upon the removal of the society to Somerset House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the Great Fire of London in September 1666 the apartments of the Royal Society in Gresham College were&nbsp;required for the use of the city authorities, and the society&nbsp;were therefore invited by Henry Howard of Norfolk to&nbsp;meet in Arundel House. At the same time he presented&nbsp;them with the library purchased by his grandfather&nbsp;Thomas, earl of Arundel, and thus the foundation was&nbsp;laid of the magnificent collection of scientific works, probably not far short of 45,000 volumes, which the society&nbsp;at the present time possesses. Of the Arundel MSS. the&nbsp;bulk was sold to the trustees of the British Museum in&nbsp;1830 for the sum of «£3559, the proceeds being devoted</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
