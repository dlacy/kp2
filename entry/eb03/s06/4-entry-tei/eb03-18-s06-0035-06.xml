the <hi rend="smallcaps">owl,</hi> in ornithology, a genus belonging to the order of <hi rend="italic">accipitres.</hi> The bill is hooked, but has no cere or wax ; the noſtrils are covered with ſetaceous feathers ; the head is very large, as are alſo the ears and eyes ; and the tongue is bifid. There are 46 ſpecies ; the moſt remarkable are,</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">bubo,</hi> or great-eared owl, in ſize is almoſt equal to an eagle. Irides bright yellow; head and whole body finely varied with lines, ſpots, and ſpecks of black, brown, cinereous, and ferruginous. Wings long ; tail ſhort, marked with duſky bars. Legs thick, covered to the very end of the toes with a cloſe and full down of a teſtaceous colour. Claws great, much hooked, and duſky. — It has been ſhot in Scotland and in Yorkſhire. It inhabits inacceſſible rocks and desert places ; and preys on hares and feathered game. Its appearance in cities was deemed an unlucky omen ; Rome itſelf once underwent a luſtration becauſe one of them ſtrayed into the capitol. The ancients had them in the utmoſt abhorrence ; and thought them, like the ſcreech-owls, the meſſengers of death. Pliny ſtyles it <hi rend="italic">bubo funebris,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">noctis monstrum.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Solaque culminibus</hi> ferali <hi rend="italic">carmine</hi> bubo</p><p><hi rend="italic">Saepe queri et longas in fletum ducere voces.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Virgil.</hi> Perch’d on the roof, the bird of night complains,</p><p>In lengthen’d ſhrieks and dire funereal strains.</p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">otus,</hi> or long-eared owl, is found, though not frequently, in the north of England, in Cheſhire, and in Wales. Mr Haſſelquiſt ſaw it alive in Cairo, and it is not unfrequent all over Egypt. Its weight, according to Dr Latham, is nine ounces; the length 14 inches and a half ; the breadth 34 ; the irides are of a bright yellow ; the bill black ; the breaſt and belly are of a dull yellow, marked with ſlender brown ſtrokes pointing downwards; the thighs and vent feathers of the same colour, but unſpotted. The back and coverts of the wings are varied with deep brown and yellow; the quill-feathers of the ſame colour, but near the ends of the outmoſt is a broad bar of red; the tail is marked with duſky and reddiſh bars, but beneath appears aſh-coloured ; the horns or ears are about an inch long, and conſiſt of six feathers variegated with yellow and black ; the feet are feathered down to the claws.</p><p>3. The brachyotos, or ſhort-eared owl, is 14 inches long; three feet broad; the head is ſmall and hawk-like ; the bill is duſky; weight 14 ounces; the circle of feathers that immediately ſurrounds the eyes is black ; the larger circle white, terminated with tawny and black ; the feathers on the head, back, and coverts of the wings, are brown, edged with pale dull yellow ; the breaſt and belly are of the ſame colour, marked with a few long narrow ſtreaks of brown pointing downwards ; the quill-ſeathers are duſky, barred with red ; the tail is of a very deep brown, adorned on each side of the ſhaft of the four middle feathers with a yellow circle which contains a brown ſpot ; the tip of the tail is white. The horns of this ſpecies are very ſmall, and each conſiſts of only a single feather ; theſe it can raiſe or depress at pleaſure ; and in a dead bird are with difficulty diſcovered. This kind is ſcarcer than the former ; both are ſolitary birds, avoiding inhabited places. Theſe ſpecies may be called <hi rend="italic">long-winged owls ;</hi> the wings when cloſed reaching beyond the end of the tail ; whereas in the common kinds they fall ſhort of it.—This is a bird of paſſage, and has been obſerved to visit Lincolnſhire in the beginning of October, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0042.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0036"/>
to retire early in the ſpring ; ſo probably, as it performs its migrations with the woodcock, its ſummer-retreat is Norway. During day it lies hid in long old graſs ; when disturbed, it ſeldom flies far, but will light, and sit looking at one, at which time the horns may be seen very diſtinctly. It has not been obſerved to perch on trees like other owls ; it uſually flies in search of prey in cloudy hazy weather. Farmers are fond of feeing theſe birds in the fields, as they clear them from mice. It is found frequently on the hill of Hoy in the Orkneys, where it flies about and preys by day like a hawk. It is found alſo, as we mentioned before, in Lancaſhire, which is a hilly and woody country ; and in New England and Newfoundland.</p><p>4. The flammea <hi rend="italic">,</hi> or common white owl. The elegant plumage or this bird makes amends for the uncouthneſs of its form : a circle of soft white feathers surround the eyes. The upper part of the body, the coverts, and ſecondary feathers of the wings, are of a fine pale yellow : on each ſide of the shafts are two grey and two white ſpots placed alternate: the exterior ſides of the quill-feathers are yellow ; the interior white, marked on each ſide with four black ſpots : the lower ſide of the body is wholly white ; the interior ſides or the feathers of the tail are white ; the exterior marked with ſome obſcure duſky bars ; the legs are feathered to the feet : the feet are covered with short hairs : the edge of the middle claw is ſerrated. The uſual weight is 11 ounces; its length 14 inches; its breadth 3 feet.— This ſpecies is almoſt domeſtic ; inhabiting, for the greateſt part of the year, barns, hay-lofts, and other out houſes ; and is as uſeful in clearing thoſe places from mice as the congenial cat : towards twilight it quits its perch, and takes a regular circuit round the fields, ſkimming along the ground in queſt of field-mice, and then returns to its uſual residence : in the breeding-ſeaſon it takes to the eaves of churches, holes in lofty buildings, or hollows of trees. During the time the young are in the neſt, the male and female alternately ſally out in queſt of food, make their circuit, beat the fields with the regularity of a ſpaniel, and drop inſtantly on their prey in the graft. They very ſeldom ſtay out above five minutes ; return with their prey in their claws ; but as it is neceſſary to shift it into their bill, they always alight for that purpoſe on the roof, before they attempt to enter their neſt. This ſpecies does not hoot ; but ſnores and hisses in a violent manner; and while it flies along will often ſcream moſt tremendously. Its only food is mice. As the young of theſe birds keep their neſt for a great length of time, and are fed even long after they can fly, many hundreds of mice will ſcarcely ſuffice to ſupply them with food. Owls caſt up the bones, fur, or feathers of their prey, in form of ſmall pellets, after they have devoured it, in the ſame manner as hawks do. A gentleman, on grubbing up an old pollard aſh that had been the habitation of owls for many generations, found at the bottom many buſhels of this rejected stuff. Some owls, when they are ſatisfied, hide the remainder of their meat like dogs.</p><p>5. The stridula, or tawny owl. The female of this ſpecies weighs 19 ounces ; the length is 15 inches ; the breadth 2 feet 8 inches ; the irides are duſky ; the ears in this, as in all owls, very large ; and their ſenſe of hearing very exquiſite. The colour of this kind is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh it from every other: that of the back, head, coverts of the wings, and on the ſcapular feathers, being a fine tawny red, elegantly ſpotted and powdered with the black or duſky ſpots of various ſizes : on the coverts of the wings and on the ſcapulars are ſeveral large white ſpots : the coverts of the tail are tawny, and quite free from any marks : the tail is variously blotched, barred and ſpotted with pale red and black ; in the two middle feathers the red predominates : the breast and belly are yellowiſh, mixed with white, and marked with narrow black ſtrokes pointing downwards: the legs are covered with feathers down to the toes.—This is a hardier ſpecies than the former ; and the young will feed on any dead thing, whereas thoſe of the white owl muſt have a constant ſupply of freſh meat. It is the ſtrix of Aldrovandus, and what we call the s <hi rend="italic">creech-owl ;</hi> to which the folly of ſuperſtition had given the power of preſaging death by its cries. The ancients believed that it sucked the blood of young children : a fact ſome think not incredible ; for Haſſelquiſt deſcribes a ſpecies found in Syria, which frequently in the evening flies in at the windows, and destroys the helpleſs infant.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nocte volant, pueroſque petunt nutricis egentes,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Et vitiant cuneis corpora rapta ſuis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Carpere dicuntur la dentia viſcera rostris,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Et plenum poto ſanguine guttur habent.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Est illis strigibus nomen, sed nominis hujus</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Causa quod horrenda ſlridere nocte solent.</hi></p><p>Ovid Fast. vi. 135.</p><p>6. The <hi rend="italic">ulula,</hi> or brown owl, agrees with the former in its marks ; differing only in the colours : in this, the head, wings, and back, are or a deep brown, spotted with black in the ſame manner as the former : the coverts of the wings and the ſcapulars are adorned with ſimilar white ſpots : the exterior edges of the four firſt quill-feathers in both are ſerrated: the breast in this is of a very pale ash-colour mixed with tawny, and marked with oblong jagged spots : the feet too are feathered down to the very claws : the circle round the face is aſh-coloured, ſpotted with brown.— both theſe ſpecies inhabit woods, where they reſide the whole day : in the night they are very clamorous ; and when they hoot, their throats are inflated to the ſize of an hen’s egg. In the duſk they approach our dwellings; and will frequently enter pigeon-houſes, and make great havoc in them. They destroy numbers of little leverets, as appears by the legs frequently found in their neſts. They also kill abundance of moles, and ſkin them with as much dexterity as a cook does a rabbit. They build in hollow trees or ruined edifices; lay four eggs, of an elliptic form, and of a whitiſh colour.</p><p>7. The passerina, or little owl, is very rare in England ; it is ſometimes found in Yorkſhire, Flintshire, and also near London : in ſize it ſcarcely exceeds a thruſh, though the fulness of its plumage makes it appear larger : the irides are of a light yellow ; the bill of a paper-colour; the feathers that encircle the face are white tipt with black ; the head brown, ſpotted with white ; on the bread is a mixture of white and brown ; the belly is white, marked with a few brown ſpots ; the tail of the ſame colour with the back ; in each feather barred with white ; in each adorned with circular white ſpots, placed oppoſite to one another on both ſides of the shaft ; the legs and feet are covered with feathers down to the claws.—The Italians make uſe of this owl to decoy ſmall birds to the limed twig ; the method of which is exhibited in Olina’s <hi rend="italic">Uccelliera,</hi> p. 65. Mr Steuart, author of the Antiquities of Athens, informed Mr Pennant, that this species of owl was very common in Attica ; that they were birds of paſſage, and appeared there in the beginning of April in great numbers ; that they bred there ; and that they retired at the ſame time as the storks, whoſe arrival they a little preceded.</p><p>8.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Lath. Syn. vol. vii. p. 50.</p></note> The ſpectacle owl of Cayenne, which is accurately deſcribed by Dr Latham, is 21 inches in length : the upper parts of the body are of a reddiſh colour ; the lower parts<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0043.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0037"/>
of a rufous white : the head and neck are white, and not ſo full of feathers as thoſe of owls generally are, and from this circumſtance it appears not unlike a hawk: a large patch of dark brown ſurrounds each eye, giving the bird much the appearance of wearing ſpectacles; the legs are covered with feathers quite to the toes, and are of a yellowiſh colour. A ſpecimen of this curious bird may be ſeen in the Leverian museum.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
