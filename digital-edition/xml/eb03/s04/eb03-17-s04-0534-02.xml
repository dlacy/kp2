It conſiſts of a plank of the length of the keel of a moderate ſhip, raiſed a little behind, and hollow in the middle; ſo that the sides go a little aſlope, and are furniſhed with holes to receive pins, &amp; c. The reſt is quite even.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sledge</hi> is a large ſmith’s hammer, to be uſed with both hands : of this there are two forts, the up-hand sledge, which is uſed by under workmen, when the work is not of the largeſt sort ; it is uſed with both the hands before, and they ſeldom raiſe it higher than their head. But the other, which is called the about-ſledge, and which is uſed for battering or drawing out the largeſt work, is held by the handle with both hands, and ſwung round over their heads, at their arm’s end, to strike as hard a blow as they can.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
