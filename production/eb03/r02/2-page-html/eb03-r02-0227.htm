<p><span class="font0">ſoner, as </span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">was making preparations to oppoſe them. Nothing can exceed the indignities, as well as the cruelties, which were practiſed upon this unhappy monarch,&nbsp;thus fallen into the hands of his enemies. Sapor, we&nbsp;are told, always uſed him as a footſtool ſor mounting his&nbsp;horſe ; he added the bitterneſs of ridicule to his inſults,&nbsp;and uſually obſerved, That an attitude like that to which&nbsp;Valerian was reduced, was the beſt ſtatue that could be&nbsp;erected in honour of his victory. This horrid liſe of&nbsp;inſult and ſufferance continued for ſeven years, and was&nbsp;at length terminated by the cruel Perſian’s commanding his priſoner’s eyes to be plucked out, and afterwards&nbsp;cauſing him to be ſtead alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The news of the defeat of the Roman army by the Perſians, and the captivity of Valerian, no ſooner&nbsp;reached the barbarous nations at war with Rome, than&nbsp;they poured on all ſides into the Roman territories in&nbsp;incredible multitudes, threatening the empire, and&nbsp;Rome itſelf, with utter deſtruction. The Goths and&nbsp;Scythians ravaged Pontus and Aſia, committing every&nbsp;where dreadful devaſtations ; the Alemanni and Franks&nbsp;having over-run Rhætia, advanced as far as Ravenna;&nbsp;putting all to fire and ſword ; the Quadi and Sarmatians ſeized on great part of Dacia and Pannonia ;&nbsp;while other barbarous nations, invading Spain, made&nbsp;themſelves maſters of Tarraco and other important&nbsp;places in that province. In the mean time Gallienus,&nbsp;the ſon of Valerian, having promiſed to revenge his&nbsp;father’s captivity, and repreſs the barbarians, was choſen emperor without any oppoſition. He was at that&nbsp;time in Gaul ; but haſtened into Italy, from whence&nbsp;he drove out the barbarians, either by the terror of&nbsp;his approach, or by overcoming them in battle.—&nbsp;In Dacia and Pannonia, alſo, the barbarians were driven back by Regillianus, who commanded there, and&nbsp;who is ſaid to have gained ſeveral victories in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But in the mean time, one Ingenuus, a man of great reputation in war, and univerſally beloved both by the&nbsp;people and ſoldiery, cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed emperor in Pannonia, where he was generally acknowledged as well as in M</span><span class="font2">æ</span><span class="font0">ſia. Gallienus no ſooner heard of&nbsp;his revolt, than he marched from the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Ravenna, where he then was, into Illyricum, engaged&nbsp;Ingenuus, and put him to flight. Some authors tell us,&nbsp;that Ingenuus was killed after the battle by his own&nbsp;ſoldiers ; while others affirm, that he put an end to his&nbsp;own life to avoid falling into the hands of Gallienus,&nbsp;who uſed his victory with a cruelty hardly to be parallelled. The following letter to Verianus Celer, one of&nbsp;his officers, will ſhow the diſpoſition of this emperor ;&nbsp;“ I ſhall not be ſatisfied (ſays he) with your putting&nbsp;to death only ſuch as have borne arms againſt me, and&nbsp;might have fallen in the field : you muſt in every city&nbsp;deſtroy all the males, old and young ; ſpare none who&nbsp;have wiſhed ill to me ; none who have ſpoken ill of me&nbsp;the ſon of Valerian, the father and brother of princes.&nbsp;Ingenuus emperor 1. Tear, kill, cut in pieces without&nbsp;mercy : you underſtand me ; do then as you know I&nbsp;would do, who have written to you with my own hand.”&nbsp;In conſequence of theſe cruel orders, a moſt dreadful&nbsp;havock was made among that unhappy people ; .and, in&nbsp;ſeveral cities, not one male child was left alive. The&nbsp;troops who had formerly ſerved under Ingenuus, and&nbsp;the inhabitants of Mæſia who had eſcaped the general</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſlaughter, provoked by theſe cruelties, proclaimed </span><span class="font1">Re* </span><span class="font0">gillianus emperor. He was a Dacian by birth, deſeended, as was ſaid, ſrom the celebrated king Decebalus whom Trajan had conquered ; and had, by ſeveral gallant actions, gained reputation in the Roman&nbsp;armies. After he was proclaimed emperor, he gained&nbsp;great advantages over the Sarmatians ; but was ſoon&nbsp;after, murdered by his own ſoldiers. Theſe revolts were&nbsp;quickly followed by many others. Indeed it is not ſurpriſing, at a time when the reins </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">government were&nbsp;held with ſo looſe an hand, that a crowd of uſurpers&nbsp;ſhould ſtart up in every province of the empire. The&nbsp;great number of uſurpers who pretended to the empire&nbsp;about this time have been diſtinguiſhed by the name of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thirty tyrants.</span><span class="font0"> However, there were only 19 ; viz.&nbsp;Cyriades, Macrianus, Baliſta, Udenatus, and Zenobia&nbsp;in the eaſt : in Gaul, and the weſtern provinces, Poſt-humus, Lollianns, Victorinus and his mother Victoria,&nbsp;Marius, and Tetricus ; in Illyricum, and on the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus, Regillianus, and Au-reolus ; in Pontus, Saturninus ; in Iſſuria, Trebellianus ; in Theſſaly, Piſo ; in Achaia, Valens ; in. Egypt,&nbsp;-Æmilianus ; and in Africa, Celſus. Several of theſe&nbsp;pretenders to the empire, however, though branded&nbsp;with the opprobrious appellation of tyrants, were eminent examples of virtue, and almoſt all of them were&nbsp;poſſeſſed of a conſiderable ſhare of vigour and ability.&nbsp;The principal reaſon aſſigned for their revolt was, the&nbsp;infamous character of Gallienus, whom neither officers&nbsp;nor ſoldiers could bear to ſerve. Many of them, how«&nbsp;ever, were forced by the ſoldiers to affirme the imperial&nbsp;dignity much againſt their will. “ You have loſt,” ſaid&nbsp;Saturninus to his ſoldiers when they inveſted him with&nbsp;the purple, “ a very uſeſui commander, and have made&nbsp;a very wretched emperor.” The apprehenſions of Saturninus were juſtified by the event. Of the 19 uſurpers&nbsp;already mentioned, not one died a natural death ; and&nbsp;in Italy and Rome Gallienus alone continued to be acknowledged emperor. That prince indeed honoured&nbsp;Odenatus prince of Palmyra with the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Augujlus<sub>y&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">who continued to poſſeſs an independent ſovereignty in&nbsp;the eaſt all his liſetime, and on his death tranſmitted it&nbsp;to his wife Zenobia. See Palmyra/</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The conſequences of theſe numerous uſurpations were the moſt fatal that can be conceived. The elections of theſe precarious emperors, their life and death,&nbsp;were equally deſtructive to their ſubjects and adherents. The price of their elevation was inſtantly paid&nbsp;to the troops by an immenſe donative drawn from the&nbsp;exhauſted people. However virtuous their character,&nbsp;and however pure their intentions might be, they found&nbsp;themſelves reduced to the neceſſity of ſupporting their&nbsp;uſurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty.&nbsp;When they fell, they involved armies and provinces in&nbsp;their fall, as appears from the letter of Gallienus ah&nbsp;ready quoted. Whilſt-the forces of the ſtate were diſperſed in private quarrels, the defenceleſs provinces lay&nbsp;expoſed· to every invader. The braveſt uſurpers were&nbsp;compelled, by the perplexity of their ſituation, to conclude diſhonourable treaties with the barbarians, and&nbsp;even to ſubmit to ſhameful tributes, and - introduce ſuch numbers of barbarians into the Roman ſervice as ſeemed ſufficient at once to overthrow the&nbsp;empire.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
