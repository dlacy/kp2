<p><span class="font1">ed by gentle degrees, and the diſtillation continued till 30 pounds of water are come over, which is generally&nbsp;done in about four or five hours ; this roſe-water is to&nbsp;be poured again on a freſſi quantity (40 pounds) of&nbsp;roſes, and from 15 to 20 pounds of water are to be&nbsp;drawn by diſtillation, following the ſame proceſs as before. The roſe-water thus made and cohobated will be&nbsp;found, if the roſes were good and freſh, and the diſtillation carefully performed, highly ſcented with the&nbsp;roſes. It is then poured into pans either of earthen&nbsp;ware or of tinned metal, and left expoſed to the freſh&nbsp;air for the night. The ottar or effence will be found&nbsp;in the morning congealed, and ſwimming on the top&nbsp;of the water ; this is to be carefully ſeparated and collected either with a thin ſhell or a ſkimmer, and poured into a vial. When a certain quantity has thus been&nbsp;obtained, the water and feces muſt be ſeparated from&nbsp;the clear effence, which, with reſpect to the firſt, will&nbsp;not be difficult to do, as the effence congeals with a&nbsp;flight cold, and the water may then be made to run&nbsp;off. If, after that, the effence is kept fluid by heat,&nbsp;the feces will ſubſide, and may be ſeparated ; but if the&nbsp;operation has been neatly performed, theſe will be little&nbsp;or rone. The feces are as highly perfumed as the effence, and muſt be kept, after as much of the effence&nbsp;has been ſkimmed from the roſe-water as could be.&nbsp;The remaining water ſhould be uſed for freſh diſtil-lations, inſtead of common water, at leaſt as far as it&nbsp;will go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The above is the whole proceſs, as given in the Afia-tic Reſearches by lieutenant-colonel Polier ∙, of making genuine otter of roſes. But attempts (he ſays) are often made to augment the quantity, though at the ex-pence of the quality. Thus the raſpinga of ſandal-wood, which contain a deal of effential oil, are uſed ;&nbsp;but the impoſition is eaſily diſeovered, both by the ſinell,&nbsp;and becauſe the effential oil of ſandal-wood will not&nbsp;congeal in common cold. In other places they adulterate the otter by diſtiſting with the roſes a ſweet-ſcented graſs, wſhich colours it of a high clear green.&nbsp;This does not congeal in a flight cold. There are numerous other modes, far more palpable, of adulteration.&nbsp;The quantity of effential oil to be obtained from roſes&nbsp;is very precarious, depending on the ſkill of the diſtil.&nbsp;1er, on the quality of the roſes, and the favourableneſs&nbsp;of the ſeaſon. The colour of the otter is no criterion&nbsp;of its goodneſs, quality, or country The calyxes by&nbsp;no means diminiſh the quality of otter, nor do they impart any green colour to it. They indeed augment the&nbsp;quantity, but the trouble neccffary to ſtrip them is ſuch&nbsp;as to prevent their being often uſed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSETTO, a town of Africa, in Egypt, is plea-ſantly ſituated on the welt ſide of that branch of the Nile called by the ancients </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bolbιtinum,</span><span class="font1"> affirmed by Herodotus to have been formed by art ; the town and&nbsp;caſtle being on the right hand as you enter that river.&nbsp;Any one that iees the hills about Roſetto would judge&nbsp;that they had been the ancient barriers of the ſea, and&nbsp;conclude that the ſea has not loſt more ground than the&nbsp;/pace between the hills and the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roſetto is eſteemed one of the pleafanteſt places in Egypt ; it is about two miles long, and conſiſts&nbsp;only of two or three ſtreets. The country about it is&nbsp;moſt delightful and fertile, as is all the whole Delta&nbsp;on the other ſide of the Nile, exhibiting the moſt plea-ſant profpect of gardens, orchards, and corn-fie!ds, excellently well cultivated. The caſtle ſtands about two&nbsp;miles north of the town, on the weft ſide of the river.&nbsp;It is a ſquare building, with round towers at the four&nbsp;corners, mounted with ſome pieces of braſs cannon.&nbsp;The walls are of brick, caſed with ftone, ſuppoſed to&nbsp;have been built in the time of the holy war, though&nbsp;ſince repaired by Cheyk Begh. At a little diſtance&nbsp;lower, on the other ſide of the river, is a platform,&nbsp;mounted with ſome guns, and to the eaſt of it are the&nbsp;fait lakes, out of which they gather great quantities of&nbsp;that commodity. At ſome farther diſtance, Tailing up&nbsp;the river, we ſee a high mountain, on which ſtands an&nbsp;old building that ſerves for a w<sup>r</sup>atch-tower. From this&nbsp;eminence is diſeovered a large and deep gulph, in form&nbsp;of a creſcent, which appears to have been the work of&nbsp;art, though it be now filled up, and diſcovers nothing&nbsp;but its ancient bed. Roſetto is grown a conſiderable&nbsp;place for commerce, and hath ſome good manufactures&nbsp;in the linen and cotton way ; but its chief bufineſs is&nbsp;the carriage of goods to Cairo, all the European&nbsp;merchandiſe being brought thither from Alexandria by&nbsp;ſea, and carried in other boats to that capital ; as thoſe&nbsp;that are brought down from it on the Nile are there&nbsp;ſhipped off for Alexandria ; on which account the Europeans have here their vice-conſulsand factors to tranſact&nbsp;their bufineſs ; and the government maintains a beigh,&nbsp;a cuſtomhouſe, and a garriſon, to keep all ſafe and&nbsp;quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the country to the north of Roſetto are delightful gardens, full of orange, lemon, and citron trees, and almoſt all forts of fruits, with a variety of groves of&nbsp;palm-trees ; and when the fields are green with rice, it&nbsp;adds greatly to the beauty of the country. It is about&nbsp;25 miles north-eaſt of Alexandria, and 100 north-weſt&nbsp;of Cairo. E. Long. 30. 45. N. Lat. 31. 30.</span></p>
