<p><span class="font1">RIO DE CONTAS, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Villa de Contas,</span><span class="font1"> a town of Brazil in the state of Bahia, 230 m. S.W. from the city of Bahia, on&nbsp;the Brumado (Contas-Pequeno), a head stream of the Rio de&nbsp;Contas (Jussiape), which rises on the eastern slope of the neighbouring Serra das Almas, and flows S.E. and E. to the Atlantic&nbsp;coast at Barra do Rio de Contas. Pop. (1890), including&nbsp;rural districts, 17,318. The surrounding country is fertile&nbsp;and produces sugar, cotton, mandioca and tobacco, but has&nbsp;lost much of its prosperity through the droughts that have&nbsp;devastated the interior of the state, and because of the costs of&nbsp;transporting produce to market. Stock-raising was at one time&nbsp;an important industry here. The town was founded in 1715&nbsp;by some “ Paulistas ” who discovered gold there in the sands&nbsp;of the river. It became a “ villa ” in 1724, but was soon&nbsp;afterward moved down the river '5 m. to a more convenient&nbsp;site on the high road between Bahia and Goyaz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIO DE JANEIRO, a maritime state of Brazil, bounded N. by Minas Geraes, E. by Espirito Santo and the Atlantic, S. by&nbsp;the Atlantic, and W. by Säo Paulo. It is one of the smaller&nbsp;states of the republic and has an area of 26,635 sq.m.; pop.&nbsp;(1900) 926,585. The state is traversed longitudinally hy the&nbsp;Serra do Mar, which divides it into a low, narrow, irregular&nbsp;coastal zone, and a broad elevated river valley through which&nbsp;the Parahyha flows eastward to the Atlantic. The eastern&nbsp;part of this valley widens out into a great alluvial plain on&nbsp;which are to be found some of the richest sugar estates of&nbsp;Brazil. The central mountainous region is heavily wooded,&nbsp;the coast region is hot and in places malarial, but the valleys&nbsp;are fertile and well watered. The Parahyha valley has long&nbsp;been celebrated for its fertility, and was for many years the&nbsp;centre of the coffee-producing industry. The exhaustion of&nbsp;the soil and antiquated methods of cultivation have caused a&nbsp;great decline in this industry, and many of its coffee plantations&nbsp;are now either abandoned or are producing but a fraction of&nbsp;earlier crops. Stock-raising has been slowly developing since&nbsp;the abolition of slavery (1888) and the decline in coffee production, and the state now possesses large herds of cattle and&nbsp;droves of swine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stated agricultural and pastoral products are coffee, sugr, rum, Indian corn, mandioca (both bitter and sweet), cotton, tropical&nbsp;fruits, cattle, hogs, butter, cheese, fresh milk and lard. The&nbsp;state is well watered by the Parahyba </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and its tributaries&nbsp;and by numerous short streams flowing from the Serra do Mar to&nbsp;the coast. Manufacturing has been developed Jargely because&nbsp;of the fine water power supplied by the mountain streams, and&nbsp;among the manufactures are cotton, woollen, silk and jute fabrics,&nbsp;brick, tile and rough pottery, sugar, rum, vehicles, furniture, beer&nbsp;and fruit conserves. The state is well provided with railways,&nbsp;which include the Central do Brazil, Leopoldina, Mdhoramentos&nbsp;and Rio do Ouro. The Central line runs from the city of Rio de&nbsp;Janeiro N.N.W. across the Serra do Mar to the Parahyba valley,&nbsp;where it divides into two branches at the station of Barra do&nbsp;Pirahy, one running westward to Sao Paulo, and the other eastward&nbsp;and northward into Minas Geraes. Besides these there are a&nbsp;number of short railways called the Theresopolis, Uniao Valen-ciana, Rio das Flores, Bananal, and Vassourense lines. The total&nbsp;extension of these railways in the state in 1907 was 1445 m. Other&nbsp;than Nictheroy, the ports of. the state are Sao Toao da Barra,&nbsp;Macahe or Imbetiba, Cabo Frio and Paraty, but they are visited&nbsp;only by the smaller coasting vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The capital of the state is Nictheroy on the E. side of the Bay of Rio de Janeiro, and other cities and towns, with their&nbsp;populations in 1890 except where otherwise stated, are: Campos&nbsp;(estimate, in 1907, 35,000), on the lower Parahyba in the midst&nbsp;of a rich sugar-producing region; Rio Bonito (19,321); Ita-borahy (17,817); Barra Mansa (14,449), on the upper Parahyba;&nbsp;Rezende (14,370), in a fertile district of the upper Parahyba;&nbsp;Petropolis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)',</span><span class="font1"> Cantagallo (about 9000), in a rich coffee&nbsp;district of the Scrra do Mar; Paraty (10,765), a small port on&nbsp;the W. side of the bay of Angra dos Reis; Valenca (11,965);&nbsp;Vassouras (9666); Säo Fidelis (11,770), a river port on the&nbsp;lower Parahyba having steamboat communication with Campos;&nbsp;Macahe (about 7000 in 1900), an old port on the eastern coast of&nbsp;the state at the mouth of the Macahé river whose original&nbsp;anchorage has been filled with silt, and that of Imbetiba, in&nbsp;the vicinity, with which it is connected by tramway, is now&nbsp;used by vessels both for the town and the Macahé and Campos&nbsp;railway; Barra do Pirahy (7750), an important station and&nbsp;junction of the Central do Brazil railway on the N. side of&nbsp;the Scrra do Mar, with large manufacturing and commercial&nbsp;interests; Parahyba do Sul (7343), in a fertile, long-settled&nbsp;district in the N.E. part of the state; Maricâ. (10,373); Cabo&nbsp;Frio (10,382); Pirahy (10,429); Saquarema (12,489); Nova&nbsp;Friburgo (9857); and Araruama (9087).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIO DE JANEIRO (in full, SXo </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">SebastiXo do Rio de Janeiro,</span><span class="font1"> colloquially shortened to Rio), a city and port of Brazil,&nbsp;capital of the republic, and seat of an archbishopric, on the&nbsp;western side of the Bay of Rio de Janeiro, or Guanabara, in lat.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>5°54<sup>,2</sup>3*S., long. 43°8'34*W; (the position of the Observatory).&nbsp;The city is situated in the S.E. angle of the Federal District&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Dtstricto Federal)</span><span class="font1"> formerly known as the Neutral Municipality&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Municipio Neutro),</span><span class="font1"> an independent district or commune&nbsp;with an area of 538 sq. m., which was detached from the province of Rio de Janeiro in 1834. The city stands in great&nbsp;part on an alluvial plain formed hy the filling in of the western&nbsp;shore of the hay, which extends inland from the shore-line in a&nbsp;north-westerly direction between a detached group of mountains&nbsp;on the S. known as the Serra da Carioca, and the imposing&nbsp;wooded heights of the Serra do Mar on the N. The spurs of&nbsp;the Carioca range project into this plain, in some places, closely&nbsp;up to the margin of the bay, forming picturesque valleys within&nbsp;the limits of the city. Some of the residential quarters follow&nbsp;these valleys up into the mountains and extend up their&nbsp;slopes and over the lower spurs, which, with the hills covered&nbsp;with buildings rising in the midst of the city, give a picturesque&nbsp;appearance. At the entrance to the bay is the Sugar Loaf&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Päo de Assucar),</span><span class="font1"> a conical rock rising 1212 ft. above the water-level and forming the terminal point of a short range between&nbsp;the city and the Atlanticcoast. The culminating point of&nbsp;that part of the Carioca range which projects into and partly&nbsp;divides the city is the Corcovado (Hunchback), a sharp rocky&nbsp;peak 2329 ft. high overlooking the Botafogo suburb and approachable only on the wooded N.W. side. These spurs are&nbsp;covered with luxuriant vegetation, excepting their perpendicular faces and the slopes occupied by the suburbs. Considerably beyond the limits of the city on its S.W. side, but within&nbsp;the municipality, is the huge isolated flat-topped rock known&nbsp;as the Gavea, 2575 ft. high, which received its name from its&nbsp;resemblance to the square sail used on certain Portuguese craft.&nbsp;The sky-line of this range of mountains, as seen by the approaching traveller some miles outside the entrance to the bay,&nbsp;forms the rough outline of a huge reclining figure called “ the&nbsp;sleeping giant,” the facial profile of which is also known as&nbsp;“ Lord Hood’s nose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The entrance to the bay, between the Sugar Loaf on the W. and the Pico on the E., with fortress of Santa Cruz on one&nbsp;side and the fort of Sao Joao on the other, is about a mile&nbsp;wide and free from obstructions. Almost midway in the&nbsp;channel are the little island and fort of Lage, so near the level&nbsp;of the sea that the spray is sometimes carried completely&nbsp;over it. On the W. is the semicircular bay of Botafogo,&nbsp;round which are grouped the residences of one of the richest&nbsp;suhurbs; on the E., the almost land-locked bay of Jurujuba&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nictheroy).</span><span class="font1"> The bay extends northward nearly 16</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">J&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">nautical miles, with a maximum breadth of 11 m. and a&nbsp;minimum, between the arsenal of war </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ponta do Calabouqo)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the opposite Ponta da Gravatâ, of about 3500 yds. The&nbsp;shore-line is irregular, and has been modified by the construction&nbsp;of sea-walls and the filling in of shallow bays. Close to the&nbsp;shore are the islands of Villegaignon (occupied by a fort),&nbsp;Cobras (occupied by fortifications, naval storehouses, hospital&nbsp;and dry docks), Santa Barbara and Enxadas, the site of the&nbsp;Brazilian naval school. A small island just above the lower&nbsp;anchorage, which is occupied by port officials, was once known&nbsp;as Rat island, and is now called Ilha Fiscal. There is one lake</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
