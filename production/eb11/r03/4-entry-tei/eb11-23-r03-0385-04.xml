                <p><label>RIVERS, ANTHONY WOODVILLE</label> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Wydeville, 2nd
                        Earl (c.</hi> 1442-1483), statesman and patron of literature, and author of
                    the first book printed on English soil, was born probably in 1442. He was the son
                    of Richard de Wydeville and his wife, Jacquetta de Luxemburg, duchess of
                    Bedford. His father was raised to the peerage in his son’s infancy, and was made
                    earl of Rivers in 1466. Anthony, who was knighted before he became of age, and
                    fought at Towton in 1461, married the daughter of Lord Scales, and became a peer
                        <hi rend="italic">jure uxoris</hi> in 1462, two years after the death of
                    that nobleman. Being lord of the Isle of Wight at the time, he was in 1467
                    appointed one of the ambassadors to treat with the duke of</p>
               <p>Burgundy, and he exalted his office by challenging Anthony, comte de la Roche,
                    the bastard of Burgundy, to single fight in what was one of
                    the most famous tournaments of the age (see the elaborate narrative in Bentley’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Excerpta Historica,</hi> 176-182). In 1469 Anthony was
                    promoted to be lieutenant of Calais and captain of the king’s armada, while
                    holding other honorary posts. His father and brother were beheaded after the
                    battle of Edgecot, and he succeeded in August of that year to the earldom. He
                    accompanied Edward in his temporary flight to the Continent, and on his return
                    to England had a share in the victory of Barnet and Tewkesbury and defended
                    London from the Lancastrians. In 1473 he became guardian and governor to the
                    young prince of Wales, and for the next few years there was no man in England of
                    greater responsibility or enjoying more considerable honours in the royal
                    service. It is now that for the first time we become aware of Lord Rivers’s
                    literary occupations. His mother, the duchess, died in 1472, and his first wife
                    in 1473; in 1475 and the following year he went on pilgrimage to the holy places
                    of Italy; from this time forth there was a strong tincture of serious reflection
                    thrown over his character; he was now, as we learn from Caxton, nominated “
                    Defender and Director of the Siege Apostolic for the Pope in England.” Caxton
                    had in 1476 rented a shop in the Sanctuary at Westminster, and here had set up a
                    printing-press. The first MS. which he undertook in London was one sent to him
                    by “ the noble and puissant lord, Lord Antone, Erie of Ryvyers,” consisting of a
                    translation “ into right good and fayr Englyssh ” of Jean de Teonville’s French
                    version of a Latin work, “ a glorious fair mirror to all good Christian people.”
                    In 1477 Caxton brought out this book, as <hi rend="italic">Dictes and Sayengis
                        of the Philosophers,</hi> and it is illustrious as the first production of
                    an English printing-press. To this succeeded the <hi rend="italic">Moral
                        Proverbs</hi> of Christine de Pisan, in verse, in 1478, and a <hi
                        rend="italic">Cordial,</hi> in prose, in 1479. The original productions of
                    Lord Rivers, and, in particular, his <hi rend="italic">Balades against the Seven
                        Deadly Sins,</hi> are lost. In 1478 a marriage was arranged between him and
                    Margaret, sister of King James IIL of Scotland, but it was mysteriously broken
                    off. Rivers began to perceive that it was possible to rise too high for the
                    safety of a subject, and he is now described to us as one who “ conceiveth well
                    the mutabibity and the unstableness of this life.” After the death of Edward
                    IV., he became the object of Richard III.’s peculiar enmity, and was beheaded by
                    his orders at Pontefract on the 25th of June 1483. He was succeeded by his
                    brother Richard, the 3rd and last earl of the Wydeville family, who died in
                    1491. Lord Rivers is spoken of by Commines as “ un très-gentil chevalier,” and
                    by Sir Thomas More as “ a right honourable man, as valiant of hand as politic in
                    counsel.” His protection and encouragement of Caxton were of inestimable value
                    .to English literature, and in the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Dictes</hi>
                    the printer gives an account of his own relations with the statesman which
                    illustrates the dignity and modesty of Lord Rivers in a very agreeable way.
                    Rivers was one of the purest writers of English prose of his time.</p>
