By this means the peg advancing ſeven or eight inches beyond his ſnout, the dog is prevented front putting his noſe to the ground and raking.</p><p>As ſoon as the young dog knows his game you muſt bring him under complete ſubjection. If he is tractable, this will be eaſy; but if he is ſtubborn, it will be neceſsary to uſe the <hi rend="italic">trash cord,</hi> which is a rope or cord of 20 or 25 fathoms in length faſtened to his collar. If he refuſe to come back when called upon, you muſt check him ſmartly with the cord, which will often bring him upon his haunches. But be sure you never call to him except when you are within reach of the cord. After repeating this ſeveral times he will not fail to come back when called ; he ought then to be careſſed, and a bit of bread ſhould be given him. He ought now conſtantly to be tied up, and never unchained, except when you give him his food, and even then only when he has done ſomething to deserve it.</p><p>The next ſtep will be to throw down a piece of bread on the ground, at the ſame moment taking hold of the dog by the collar, calling out to him, “ take heed,—ſoftly.” After having held him in this manner for ſome space of time, ſay to him, “ ſeize—lay hold.” If he is impatient to lay hold of the piece of bread before the ſignal is given, correct him gently with a ſmall whip. Repeat this leſſon until he “ takes heed” well, and no longer requires to be held fast to prevent him from laying hold of the bread. When he is well accuſtomed to this manège, turn the bread with a ſtick, holding it in the manner you do a fowling-piece, and having done ſo, cry seize<hi rend="italic">.</hi> Never ſuffer the dog to eat either in the houſe or field without having first made him take heed in this manner.</p><p>Then, in order to apply this leſſon to the game, fry ſmall pieces of bread in hogs lard, with the dung of partridge ; take theſe in a linen bag into the fields, Hubbles, ploughed grounds, and paſtures, and there put the pieces in ſeveral different places, marking the ſpots with little cleft pickets of wood, which will be rendered more diſtinguiſhable by putting pieces of card in the nicks. This being done, caſt off the dog and conduct him to theſe places, always hunting in the wind. After he has caught the ſcent of the bread, if he approaches  too near, and ſeems eager to fall upon it, cry to him in a menacing tone, “ take heed ,” and if he does not ſtop immediately, correct him with the whip. He will ſoon comprehend what is required of him, and will ſtand.</p><p>At the next leſſon, take your gun charged only with powder, walk gently round the piece of bread once or twice, and fire inſtead of crying seize. The next time of practiſing this leſſon, walk round the bread four or five times, but in a greater circle than before, and continue to do this, until the dog is conquered of his impatience, and will ſtand without moving until the ſignal is given him. When he keeps his point well, and ſtands ſteady in this leſſon, you may carry him to the birds ; if he runs in upon them, or barks when they ſpring up, you muſt cor</p><p>rect him ; and if he continues to do ſo, you muſt return to the fried bread ; but this is ſeldom neceſſary.</p><p>When the dog has learned by this uſe of the bread to take heed, he may be carried to the fields with the traſh-cord dragging on the ground. When he ſprings birds for the firſt time, if he runs after them or barks, check him by calling out to him, <hi rend="italic">take heed.</hi> If he point properly, careſs him ; but you ought never to hunt without the cord until he point staunch.</p><p>If the dog runs after ſheep, and it be difficult to cure him, couple him with a ram, and their whip the dog as long as you can follow him. His cries will at firſt alarm the ram ; he will run with all his ſpeed, and drag the dog along with him ; but he will at length take courage, turn upon the dog, and butt him ſeverely with his horns. When you think the dog is ſuſſiciently chastiſed, untie him : he will never run at ſheep again.</p><p>Having now given a lew general inſtructions concerning the beſt method of training pointers, we ſhall ſubjoin a few obſervations reſpecting the moſt common ſpecies of game, the partridge, pheaſant, grouſe, woodcock, ſnipe, and wild duck.</p><p>Partridges pair in the ſpring, and lay their eggs (generally from 15 to 20) during May and part of June. The young begin to fly about the end of June, and their plumage is complete in the beginning of October. The male has a conspicuous horſeſhoe upon his breaſt, an obtuſe ſpur on the hinder part of the leg, which diſtinguiſhes him from the female. He is also rather larger.</p><p>When a ſportſman is ſhooting in a country where the birds are thin, and he no longer chooſes to range the field for the bare chance of meeting with them, the following method will ſhow him where to find them on another day. In the evening, from ſun-ſet to nightfall, he ſhould poſt himſelf in a field, at the foot of a tree or a buſh, and there wait until the partridge begin to call or juck, which they always do at that time ; not only for the purpoſe of drawing together when ſeparated, but alſo when the birds compoſing the covey are not diſperſed. After calling in this manner for ſome little ſpace of time, the partridges will take to flight ; then, if he mark the place where they alight. he may be aſſured they will lie there the whole night, unleſs diſturbed. Let him return to the ſame poſt tire next morning by break of day, and there watch a while; being careful to keep his dog in a firing, it he is not under perfect command.</p><p>As soon as the dawn begins to peep, the partridges will begin to call, and ſoon afterwards will perform the ſame manœuvre as on the preceding evening ; that is, after having called a while, they will take their flight, and will moſt commonly ſettle at a little diſtance. There in a few minutes they will call again, and ſometimes take a ſecond flight, but that will be to no great diſtance. Then as ſoon as the ſun is riſen, and the ſportſman can ſee to ſhoot, he may caſt off his dog and purſue them.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">pheaſant</hi> is of the ſize of a common dunghill cock, and lays its eggs generally in the woods, the number of which is 10 or 12.</p><p>Pheaſants are accounted ſtupid birds ; for when they are ſurpriſed they will frequently ſquat down like a rabbit, ſuppoſing themſelves to be in ſafety as ſoon as their</p></body></text></TEI>
