<p><span class="font0">ROMILLY, SIR SAMUEL (1757-1818), English legal reformer, was the second son of Peter Romilly, a watchmaker and jeweller&nbsp;in London, whose father had emigrated from Montpellier after&nbsp;the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and who had married&nbsp;Margaret Garnault, a Huguenot refugee like himself, but of a&nbsp;far wealthier family. Samuel Romilly was born in Frith&nbsp;Street, Soho, on the 1st of March 1757. He served for a time&nbsp;in his father’s shop; but his education was not neglected, and&nbsp;he became a good classical scholar and particularly conversant&nbsp;with French literature. A legacy of £2000 from one of his&nbsp;mother’s relations led to his being articled to a solicitor and&nbsp;clerk in chancery with the idea of qualifying himself to purchase the office of one of the six clerks in chancery. In 1778,&nbsp;however, he determined to go to the bar, and entered himself&nbsp;at Gray’s Inn. He went to Geneva in 1781, where he made&nbsp;the acquaintance of the chief democratic leaders, including&nbsp;Etienne Dumont. Called to the bar in 1783, he went the midland circuit, but was chiefly occupied with chancery practice.&nbsp;On the publication of Madan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thoughts on Executive Justice,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">advocating the increase of capital punishments, he at once wrote&nbsp;and published in 1786 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Observations</span><span class="font0"> on Madan’s book. Of more&nbsp;general interest is his intimacy with the great Mirabeau, to&nbsp;whom he was introduced in 1784. Mirabeau saw him daily&nbsp;for a long time and introduced him to Lord Lansdowne, who&nbsp;highly appreciated him, and, when Mirabeau became a political&nbsp;leader, it was to Romilly that he applied for an account of the&nbsp;procedure used in the English House of Commons. He visited&nbsp;Paris in 1789, and studied the course of the Revolution there;&nbsp;and in 1790 he published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thoughts on the Probable Influence of the Late Revolution in France upon Great Britain,</span><span class="font0"> a work&nbsp;of great power. His practice at the chancery bar continued&nbsp;largely to increase, and in 1800 he was made a K.C. In 1798&nbsp;he married Anne, daughter of Francis Garbett of Knill Court,&nbsp;Herefordshire; and in 1805 he was appointed chancellor of&nbsp;the county palatine of Durham. His great abilities were&nbsp;thoroughly recognized by the Whig party, to which he attached&nbsp;himself; and in 1806, on the accession of the ministry of “ All&nbsp;the Talents ” to office, he was offered the post of solicitor-general, although he had never sat in the House of Commons.&nbsp;He accepted the office, and was knighted and brought into parliament for Queenborough. He went out of office with the&nbsp;government, but remained in the House of Commons, sitting&nbsp;successively for Horsham, Wareham and Arundel. It was now&nbsp;that Sir Samuel Romilly commenced the greatest labour of his&nbsp;life, his attempt to reform the criminal law of England, then&nbsp;at once cruel and illogical. By statute law innumerable offences&nbsp;were punished by death, but, as such wholesale executions&nbsp;would be impossible, the larger number of those convicted and&nbsp;sentenced to death at every assizes were respited, after having&nbsp;heard the sentence of death solemnly passed upon them. This&nbsp;led to many acts of injustice, as the lives of the convicts depended on the caprice of the judges, while at the same time it&nbsp;made the whole system of punishments and of the criminal law&nbsp;ridiculous. Romilly saw this, and in 1808 he managed to repeal&nbsp;the Elizabethan statute, which made it a capital offence to steal&nbsp;from the person. This success, however, raised opposition, and in&nbsp;the following year three bills repealing equally sanguinary statutes&nbsp;were thrown out by the House of Lords under the influence of&nbsp;Lord Ellenborough. Year after year the same influence prevailed,&nbsp;and Romilly saw his bills rejected; but his patient efforts and&nbsp;his eloquence ensured victory eventually for his cause by opening the eyes of Englishmen to the barbarity of their criminal&nbsp;law. The only success he had was in securing the repeal, in&nbsp;1812, of a statute of Elizabeth making it a capital offence for&nbsp;a soldier or a mariner to beg without a pass from a magistrate&nbsp;or his commanding officer. Sir Samuel Romilly’s efforts made&nbsp;his name famous not only in England but all over Europe, and&nbsp;in 1818 he had the honour of being returned at the head of the&nbsp;poll for the city of Westminster. He did not long survive his&nbsp;triumph. On the 29th of October 1818 Lady Romilly died in&nbsp;the Isle of Wight. Her husband’s grief was intense, and he&nbsp;committed suicide in a fit of temporary insanity on the 2nd of&nbsp;November. No man of his time was more loved than Sir&nbsp;Samuel Romilly; his singularly sweet nature, his upright manliness, his eloquence and his great efforts on behalf of humanity&nbsp;secured him permanent fame.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROMNEY, GEORGE (1734-1802), English historical and portrait painter, was born at Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire,&nbsp;on the 26th of December 1734. His father was a builder and&nbsp;cabinet-maker of the place, and the son, having manifested a&nbsp;turn for mechanics, was instructed in the latter craft, showing&nbsp;considerable dexterity with his fingers, executing carvings&nbsp;of figures in wood, and constructing a violin, which he spent&nbsp;much time in playing. He was also busy with his pencil;&nbsp;and some of his sketches of the neighbouring rustics having&nbsp;attracted attention, his father was at length induced to&nbsp;apprentice the boy, at the age of nineteen, to an itinerant&nbsp;painter of portraits and domestic subjects named Steele, an&nbsp;artist who had studied in Paris under Vanloo; but the erratic&nbsp;habits of his instructor prevented Romney from making great&nbsp;progress in his art. In 1756 he impulsively married a young&nbsp;woman who had nursed him through a fever, and started as a&nbsp;portrait painter on his own account, travelling through the&nbsp;northern counties, executing likenesses at a couple of guineas,&nbsp;and producing a series of some twenty figure compositions,&nbsp;which were exhibited in Kendal, and afterwards disposed of&nbsp;by means of a lottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having, at the age of twenty-seven, saved about £100, he left a portion of the sum with his wife and family, and started&nbsp;to seek his fortune in London, never returning, except for brief&nbsp;visits, till he came, a broken-down and aged man, to die. Credit&nbsp;must, however, be given him for recognizing to some extent&nbsp;his family responsibilities. He did not allow his wife and&nbsp;children to fall into poverty, and he gave help to his brothers,&nbsp;who seem to have resembled him in a kind of shiftlessness of&nbsp;temperament. In London he rapidly rose into popular favour.&nbsp;His “ Death of General Wolfe ” was judged worthy of the&nbsp;second prize at the Society of Arts, but a word from Reynolds&nbsp;in praise of Mortimer’s “ Edward the Confessor ” led to the&nbsp;premium being awarded to that painter, while Romney had&nbsp;to content himself with a donation of £50, an incident which&nbsp;led to the subsequent coldness between him and the president&nbsp;which prevented him from exhibiting at the Academy or presenting himself for its honours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1764 he paid a brief visit to Paris, where he was befriended by Joseph Vernet; and his portrait of Sir Joseph Yates, painted&nbsp;on his return, bears distinct traces of his study of the works&nbsp;of Rubens then in the Luxembourg Gallery. In 1766 he&nbsp;became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and&nbsp;three years later he seems to have studied in their schools.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
