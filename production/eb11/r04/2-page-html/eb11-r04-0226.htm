<p><span class="font1">emerging only in 1909, first to attack Mr Lloyd George s budget in the country as a “ revolution,” and then—to the general&nbsp;surprise—to condemn the House of Lords in debate for rejecting&nbsp;it; and in 1910 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Parliament)</span><span class="font1"> he appeared once more to&nbsp;be coming to the front, by the resolutions he carried in regard&nbsp;to the remodelling of the Upper Chamber, when the death of&nbsp;King Edward VII. caused a temporary postponement of the&nbsp;constitutional crisis. In September 1910 he acted as head of&nbsp;the special mission sent to the Austrian court by George V. to&nbsp;announce bis accession to the throne,—a selection peculiarly&nbsp;appropriate, and cordially welcomed as such, because of his&nbsp;well-known Austrian sympathies. Indeed, in the East European crisis of 1909 Lord Rosebery had taken a somewhat&nbsp;isolated part in vindicating the attitude of Austria and her&nbsp;right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina, in opposition to the&nbsp;criticisms generally passed in the English press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After his retirement from active politics Lord Rosebery continually displayed his great qualities as a public speaker by&nbsp;eloquent and witty addresses on miscellaneous subjects. No&nbsp;public man of his time was more fitted to act as unofficial&nbsp;national orator; none more happy in the touches with which&nbsp;he could adorn a social or literary topic and charm a nonpolitical audience; and on occasion he wrote as well as he&nbsp;spoke. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pitt</span><span class="font1"> has already been mentioned; his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apprecia-lions and Addresses</span><span class="font1"> and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peel</span><span class="font1"> (containing a remarkable&nbsp;comment on the position of an English prime minister) were&nbsp;published in 1899; his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Napoleon: the Last Phase</span><span class="font1">—an ingenious,&nbsp;if paradoxical, attempt to justify Napoleon’s conduct in exile&nbsp;at St Helena—in 1900; his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cromwell</span><span class="font1"> in the same year. In&nbsp;1906 he published an appreciation of his old friend Lord Randolph&nbsp;Churchill, inspired by the publication of Mr Winston Churchill’s&nbsp;Life of his father. In its detached yet intimate way, this is a&nbsp;model of the art by which a good judge of men, possessed at&nbsp;the same time of a just historical sense, may, from the point&nbsp;of view of a contemporary on the opposite side in politics,&nbsp;correct the perspective of an official biography written under&nbsp;the limitations of filial obligation, and give tone and value to&nbsp;the picture of an interesting personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lord Rosebery’s family consisted of two sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Lord Dalmeny (b. Jan. 1882), who&nbsp;in 1909 married a daughter of Lord Henry Grosvenor, 3rd son&nbsp;of the 1 st duke of Westminster, entered parliament in 1906&nbsp;as Liberal member for Mid Lothian, but retired in 1910; he was&nbsp;well known as a cricketer, captaining the Surrey eleven in&nbsp;1905 and 1906. The younger son, the Hon. Neil Primrose&nbsp;(b. Dec. 1882), took more actively than his brother to a political&nbsp;career, and in January 1910 was returned as a Liberal for the&nbsp;Wisbech division of Cambridgeshire. The elder daughter,&nbsp;Lady Sybil, in 1903 married Captain Charles Grant; the&nbsp;younger, Lady Margaret, in 1899 married the 1st earl of&nbsp;Crewe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. Ch.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSECRANS, WILLIAM STARKE (1819-1898), American soldier, was born in Kingston, Ohio, on the 6th of September&nbsp;1819, and graduated in 1842 from the U.S. Military Academy,&nbsp;being appointed to the engineers. After serving (1843-47) as&nbsp;assistant professor at West Point, and in fort construction,&nbsp;he resigned (April 1854) from the army and went into business&nbsp;in Cincinnati. On the outbreak of the Civil War Rosecrans&nbsp;volunteered for service under McClellan and helped raise the Ohio&nbsp;“Home Guards,” with which he served in the West Virginian operations of 1861 in the rank of brigadier-general. He was second&nbsp;in command to McClellan during this campaign, and succeeded&nbsp;to the command when that officer was called to Washington.&nbsp;In the latter part of 1861 Rosecrans conducted further operations in the same region with great skill and success, and early&nbsp;in 1862 he was transferred to the West as a major-general of&nbsp;volunteers. He took part in the operations against Corinth,&nbsp;and when General John Pope was ordered to Virginia, Rosecrans&nbsp;took over command of the Army of the Mississippi with which&nbsp;he fought the successful battles of Iuka and Corinth. Soon afterwards lie was ordered to replace D. C. Buell in command of the&nbsp;forces, renamed the Army of the Cumberland about the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In December he advanced against General Braxton Bragg, and on the 31st of December to the 3rd of, January was fought the&nbsp;bloody and indecisive battle of Stone River (Murfreesboro), after&nbsp;which Bragg withdrew his army to the southward. In 1863&nbsp;Rosecrans, refusing to advance until the isolation of Vicksburg&nbsp;(farther west) was assured, did not take the offensive until&nbsp;late in June. The operations thus begun were most skilfully&nbsp;conducted, and Bragg was forced back to Chattanooga (tf.r.),&nbsp;whence he had to retire on being once more outmanoeuvred.&nbsp;But Rosecrans sustained a great defeat at the battle of Chickamauga </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> and was soon besieged in Chattanooga. He was&nbsp;then relieved from his command. Later he did good service&nbsp;in Missouri, and in March 1865 he was made brevet major-general U.S.A. He resigned in 1867, and in the following&nbsp;year became minister to Mexico. Subsequently he was engaged&nbsp;in many railway and industrial enterprises in that country,&nbsp;as also in California. He was a representative in Congress from&nbsp;California, 1881-85, and register of the treasury, 1885-93.&nbsp;Under an act of Congress he was on the 2nd of March 1889&nbsp;restored to the rank of brigadier-general, and retired. He&nbsp;died near Redondo, Cal., on the 11th of March 1898. On the&nbsp;17th of May 1902 his body was reinterred with military honours&nbsp;in the National Cemetery at Arlington, in the presence of&nbsp;President Roosevelt, members of the cabinet and many of his&nbsp;campaigning comrades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSEGGER, PETER (1843- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Austrian poet and novelist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">known down to 1894 under the pseudonym </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petri Kettenfeier, </span><span class="font1">was born at Alpl near Krieglach in Upper Styria, on the 31st&nbsp;of July 1843, the son of a peasant. Until his seventeenth year&nbsp;he was employed as a farm hand and received no regular school&nbsp;education, though he learnt reading and writing from a retired&nbsp;schoolmaster who lived near. Unfit, owing to physical weakness, for the hard labour of agriculture, he was apprenticed to a&nbsp;journeyman tailor, and on his wanderings employed his leisure&nbsp;hours in educating himself. He soon composed poems and&nbsp;wrote stories. Some of these productions he sent in 1864 to&nbsp;Dr Svobodaj the editor of the Graz </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tagespost,</span><span class="font1"> who,&nbsp;recognizing Rosegger’s extraordinary talent, interested himself&nbsp;in the young author, and with the assistance of friends enabled&nbsp;him to study (from 1865-69) at the Handelsakademie of Graz*&nbsp;In 1869, encouraged by Robert Hamerling, Rosegger published&nbsp;his first work, a volume of poems in Styrian dialect, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zither und&nbsp;Hackbrett,</span><span class="font1"> which immediately established his reputation. As&nbsp;a result, the provincial diet of Styria accorded him a substantial&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stipendium</span><span class="font1"> (scholarship) for three years, which enabled him&nbsp;to supplement his studies by foreign travel. He now devoted&nbsp;himself entirely to authorship, and in 1876 founded the monthly&nbsp;periodical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Heimgar ten.</span><span class="font1"> On the occasion of the centenary&nbsp;of its reorganization the University of Heidelberg conferred&nbsp;upon him, in 1903, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rosegger is one of the most fertile authors of recent times. His fresh natural style, sound judgment and his fascinating descriptions&nbsp;of Alpine scenery and the life of its inhabitants have made him&nbsp;one of the most popular authors of Austria and Germany. These&nbsp;characteristics are displayed to great advantage in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Schriften des&nbsp;Waldschulmeisters</span><span class="font1"> (1875), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aus meinem Handwerkerleben</span><span class="font1"> (1880),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alpengeschichten</span><span class="font1"> (1896), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Als ich noch jung war</span><span class="font1"> (1895), and in the love-story </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hann und Weib</span><span class="font1"> (1879), while his simple religious mind is&nbsp;shown in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Himmelreich</span><span class="font1"> (1901), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erdsegen</span><span class="font1"> (1900) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das ewige&nbsp;Licht</span><span class="font1"> (1897), and his attachment to friends in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gute Kameraden&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1893) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Persönliche Erinnerungen an Robert Hamerling</span><span class="font1"> (1891).&nbsp;Among his other works may be mentioned a volume of poems,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gedichte</span><span class="font1"> (1891), a popular play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am Tage des Gerichts</span><span class="font1"> (1892), two&nbsp;books for boys, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Waldferien</span><span class="font1"> (1887) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Waldjugend</span><span class="font1"> (1900), and the&nbsp;stories </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Sünderglöckl</span><span class="font1"> (1904), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wildlinge</span><span class="font1"> (1906) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I.N.R.I.&nbsp;Frohe Botschaft eines armen Sunders</span><span class="font1"> (1905), which has also been&nbsp;'translated into English.
