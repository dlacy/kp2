The buildings of the emperors have, however, made&nbsp;such radical changes in the form of the ground that any degree of&nbsp;certainty on this point is impossible. This third gate, according&nbsp;to Varro, who mentions (Z.Z., v. 164-5) all three, was called Janu-alis.@@<sup>1</sup> With regard to the last gate there is some doubt whether&nbsp;he is right in its position; Macrobius </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Satur.,</span><span class="font3"> i. 9) places it on&nbsp;tlιe slopes of the Viminal.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Remains of Period of Kings</span><span class="font3"> (753-509 b.c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most important remains of the regal period are the great wall, principally the work of Servius Tullius, by which he included&nbsp;within one circuit the separately fortified hills which were then inhabited,—the Palatine, Capitoline, Aventine, Quirinal, and Ccelian,&nbsp;and added two more, the Esquiline and Viminal. These seven&nbsp;hills formed the Septimontium@@<sup>3</sup> (Varro, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L. L.,</span><span class="font3"> iv. 41, vi. 24). Of&nbsp;even earlier date was the fort (Liv., i. 33) on the top of the Jani-culum, connected by walls with the Pons Sublicius, some massive&nbsp;foundations of which still exist, though now buried near the church&nbsp;of S. Pietro in Montorio. Existing remains show that the great&nbsp;wall is of more than one date ; part is probably earlier than Servius,&nbsp;and may be remains of the wall which, according to Livy (i. 36, 38)&nbsp;and Dionysius (iii. 37), was planned and in part carried out by&nbsp;Tarquinius Priscus ; it would seem impossible that a work of such&nbsp;gigantic magnitude could have been begun and completed in the&nbsp;lifetime of one man. It should, however, be remembered that a&nbsp;complete circuit of new wall was not required in this undertaking ;&nbsp;each, probably, of the five hills first inhabited had its own fortifications, and these were utilized in the line of the new avail. The&nbsp;space thus included was divided by Servius for political, military,&nbsp;and religious purposes into four regiones ( Varro, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L. L.,</span><span class="font3"> v. 46-54)—&nbsp;(1) the Suburana, including the Cœlian, and probably most of its&nbsp;adjacent valleys, with the Subura, the Carinæ, and part of the&nbsp;Esquiline—the derivation of Suburana from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sub urbe</span><span class="font3"> is from Junius,&nbsp;quoted by Varro ; (2) Esquilina, the main part of the Esquiline,&nbsp;including the Oppius and Cispius (es-quil-iæ, dwellings </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outside,</span><span class="font3"> cf.&nbsp;in-quil-inus) ; (3) Collina, the Viminal and Quirinal, which were&nbsp;called “ colles ” in contradistinction to the other five hills, which&nbsp;were called “montes” ; (4) Palatina, the Palatine and its adjacent&nbsp;spurs, the Velia and Germalus. It will be observed that these four&nbsp;regiones do not include the Aventine, the Capitol, and some of&nbsp;their adjacent valleys,—an omission for which it is not easy to&nbsp;account.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Excavations of the last fifteen years have done much to determine the line of the Servian wall (see Plate VI.), especially the great works undertaken in laying out a new quarter of the city on the&nbsp;Quirinal, Esquiline, and Viminal, which have laid bare and then&nbsp;mostly destroyed long lines of wall, especially along the agger.&nbsp;Beginning from the Tiber, which the Servian wall touched at a&nbsp;point near the present Ponte Rotto, and separating the Forum&nbsp;Olitorium (outside) from the Forum Boarium (inside), it ran in a&nbsp;straight line to the Capitoline Hill, the two crests of which, the&nbsp;Capitolium and the Arx, with the intermediate valley the Asylum,&nbsp;were surrounded by an earlier fortification, set (Dionys., ix. 68) </span><span class="font2">eτrt&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">0φοLs . . . καl πέτραι,ς άττοτόμοις.</span><span class="font3"> In this short space there were&nbsp;three gates,—(1) the Porta Flumentana next the river (see Cic., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ad&nbsp;Att.,</span><span class="font3"> vii. 3 ; Liv., xxxv. 19, 21) ; (2) Porta Triumphalis, site unknown and usually only mentioned in connexion with triumphal&nbsp;processions (see Cic., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In Pis.,</span><span class="font3"> 23 ; Joseph., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">BM. JuJ,</span><span class="font3"> vii. 5, 4),—&nbsp;it was probably not used except on the occasion of triumphs ; (3)&nbsp;Porta Carmentalis, close to the Capitolium.@@<sup>5</sup> From the Capitoline&nbsp;Hill the wall passed to the Quirinal along a spur of elevated ground,&nbsp;afterwards completely cut away by Trajan. Close to the Capitol was&nbsp;the gate afterwards called the Porta Ratumena, whence issued the&nbsp;Via Lata (Plut., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In Publ.,</span><span class="font3"> 13; Plin., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.,</span><span class="font3"> viii. 42). Remains&nbsp;of the wall and foundations of the gate exist in Via di Marforio,&nbsp;Nos. 81 C and 81 E. After passing Trajan’s forum, the first&nbsp;remains of the walls are on the slope of the Quirinal in the Colonna&nbsp;gardens. Near the foot of the Quirinal was the Porta Fontinalis&nbsp;(Liv., </span><span class="font1">XXXV. </span><span class="font3">10). A piece of the wall has been exposed in the new&nbsp;Via Nazionale, and also an archway under the Palazzo Antonelli,&nbsp;which has been thought to be the Porta Fontinalis. This arch is,&nbsp;however, only 6 feet 6 inches wide and (to the springing of the&nbsp;arch) 5 feet high, which seems too small for one of the principal&nbsp;gates. The Porta Sanqualis (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 345) was&nbsp;also on the Quirinal, probably on the slope between the Trevi&nbsp;fountain and the royal palace. Its position is indicated by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">existence of some tombs which give the line of the road. On the north-west of the Quirinal was the Porta Salutaris (Festus, p. 327 ;&nbsp;Liv., ix. 43), probably near the “Quattro Fontane.” In the&nbsp;Barberini palace gardens, and especially in those of the ViUa Bar-berini (Horti Sallustiani), extensive remains of the wall have been&nbsp;recently exposed and destroyed,—which was also the fate of that&nbsp;fine piece of wall that passed under the new office of finance,&nbsp;with the Porta Collina, which was not on the line of the present&nbsp;road, but about 50 yards to the south (see Dionys., ix. 68 ; Strabo,&nbsp;v. 3). Thus far in its course from the Capitol the wall skirted&nbsp;the slopes of hills, which were once much more abrupt than they are&nbsp;now ; but from the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquilina it crossed&nbsp;a large tract of level ground ; and here, by the construction of his&nbsp;great agger, Servius gained the strength which elsewhere was given&nbsp;by the natural formation of the hills. The whole line of this agger&nbsp;has been recently traced and mostly destroyed. About the middle&nbsp;of it the Porta Viminalis was found in 1872 ; it stood, as Strabo&nbsp;says, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">υπό μiσω τφ χώματι,</span><span class="font3"> and from it led a road which passed&nbsp;through the Porta Chiusa (ancient name unknown) in Aurelian’s&nbsp;wall. Foundations of the Porta Esquilina were found in 1876&nbsp;close behind the arch of Gallienus. The further course of the wall&nbsp;across the valley of the Colosseum, with its Porta Querquetulana&nbsp;and Porta Ccelimontana, probably a little beyond, is the least&nbsp;known part of the circuit. Hence the wall skirts the slopes of the&nbsp;Ccelian to the valley along which the Via Appia passed through&nbsp;the Porta Capena, near the church of S. Gregorio. Its line along&nbsp;the Aventine is fairly distinct, and near S. Balbina and in the&nbsp;Vigna Torlonia are two of the best-preserved pieces,—the former&nbsp;11 courses high (22 feet), the latter 25 (50 feet). Under the&nbsp;Aventine it appears to have touched the river near the existing&nbsp;foundations supposed to be those of the Pons Sublicius. The Porta&nbsp;Trigemina was close by the bank. Hence to our starting-point the&nbsp;river formed the defence of the city, with its massive quay wall,&nbsp;—the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">κά\η &amp;κτη</span><span class="font3"> of Plutarch </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Bom.,</span><span class="font3"> 20). A fragmentary passage&nbsp;of Varro </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(L. L.,</span><span class="font3"> v. 163) mentions two other gates, Nævia and&nbsp;Rauduscula, “the bronze gate,” but their positions are unknown.&nbsp;The site of the Porta Navalis is also very doubtful ; it was probably&nbsp;not in the Servian wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wall is built of blocks of tufa, usually the softer kinds, but varying according to its position, as in most cases the stone used&nbsp;was that quarried on the spot. In some places a good deal of&nbsp;peperino is used. The blocks average from 23 to 24 inches in&nbsp;thickness—roughly 2 Roman feet—and are laid in alternate courses&nbsp;of headers and stretchers. The best preserved piece of wall—that&nbsp;on the Aventine in the Vigna Torlonia—has one complete arch&nbsp;and the starting of another ; their sills are about 34 feet from the&nbsp;ground outside, and probably level with the ground inside (see fig. 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These arches, though built of the harder stone, are not later insertions, but are contemporary with the wall itself. The blocks, both beds and Verticaljoints, are very carefully worked and set in mortar;&nbsp;in most cases they are bevelled round the joints. Some blocks are&nbsp;of great length, — </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">άμάξιοι </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ιθoι</span><span class="font3"> Dionysius calls them. At this&nbsp;place the wall is backed with a thick mass of concrete ; the use of&nbsp;the arched openings is doubtful : they may have been embrasures&nbsp;for catapults. The discoveries of recent years have shown the correctness of the description given by Dionysius (ix. 68) of the great&nbsp;agger, with its wall and foss, begun by the earlier kings and completed by the last Tarquin. Fig. 9 shows it in section ; the earth&nbsp;taken from the foss (which was IOO feet wide at the bottom by 30&nbsp;deep) was heaped up to form the agger, and was kept in its position&nbsp;by a lofty retaining wall on the front and a lower one behind.&nbsp;The outer wall was in places strengthened with massive buttresses&nbsp;closely set, or with towers ; in other places it had no projections.&nbsp;The back wall, the position of which shows the thickness of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
