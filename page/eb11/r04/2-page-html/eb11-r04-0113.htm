<p><span class="font2">of Syracuse, led to the outbreak of war between Rome and Carthage in 264 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> The military history of the&nbsp;struggle which followed is treated in the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Punjc</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wars;</span><span class="font2"> it will suffice to note here that the war lasted until 241 </span><span class="font1">B.c., </span><span class="font2">when the Carthaginians were compelled to cede Sicily&nbsp;and the Lipari islands to Rome, and to pay an indemnity of&nbsp;3200 talents (about £800,000).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The struggle was one in which both Rome and Carthage were serving an apprenticeship in a warfare the conditions of which&nbsp;were unfamiliar to both. The Roman legions were foes very&nbsp;unlike any against which the Carthaginian leaders had ever&nbsp;led their motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called&nbsp;upon for the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight&nbsp;with ships against the greatest naval power of the age. The&nbsp;novelty of these conditions accounts for much of the vacillating&nbsp;and uncertain action observable on both sides. It is possible&nbsp;that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Rome must&nbsp;be attacked and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted&nbsp;nothing more than raids upon the coast. There are indications&nbsp;also that some in the Roman senate saw no end to the struggle&nbsp;but in the destruction of Carthage; yet an invasion of Africa&nbsp;was only once seriously attempted, and then only a half-hearted&nbsp;support was given to the expedition. But these peculiarities&nbsp;in the war served to bring out in the clearest relief the strength&nbsp;and the weakness of the two contending states. The chief&nbsp;dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited at&nbsp;home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her&nbsp;mercenary troops, and in the ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects in Libya—dangers which even the&nbsp;genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount. Rome, on the&nbsp;other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens,&nbsp;the fidelity of her allies, the valour and discipline of her legions.&nbsp;What she needed was a system which should make a better use&nbsp;of her splendid materials than one under which her plans were&nbsp;shaped from day to day by a divided senate, and executed by&nbsp;officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of&nbsp;whom returned home at the close of each summer’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Rome and Carthage in strengthening their&nbsp;respective positions. The eastern end of Sicily was still left&nbsp;under the rule of Hiero as the ally of Rome, but the larger&nbsp;western portion of the island became directly subject to Rome,&nbsp;and a temporary arrangement seems to have been made for its&nbsp;government, either by one of the two praetors, or possibly by a&nbsp;quaestor.@@<sup>1</sup> Sardinia and Corsica had not been surrendered to&nbsp;Rome by the treaty of 241, but three years later (239),&nbsp;on the invitation of the Carthaginian mercenaries&nbsp;stationed in the islands, a Roman force occupied them; Carthage protested, but, on the Romans threatening war, she gave&nbsp;way, and Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to Rome,&nbsp;though it was some seven or eight years before all resistance&nbsp;on the part of the natives themselves was crushed.&nbsp;In 227, however, the senate considered matters ripe&nbsp;for the establishment of a separate administration in her&nbsp;oversea possessions. In that year two additional praetors&nbsp;were elected; to one was assigned the charge of western Sicily,&nbsp;to the other that of Sardinia and Corsica,@@<sup>2</sup> and thus the first&nbsp;stones of the Roman provincial system were laid. Of at least&nbsp;equal importance for the security of the peninsula was the&nbsp;subjugation of the Celtic tribes in the valley of the Po. These,&nbsp;headed by the Boii and Insubres and assisted by levies from&nbsp;the Celts to the westward, had in 225 alarmed the&nbsp;whole of Italy by invading Etruria and penetrating to&nbsp;Clusium, only three days’ journey from Rome. Here, however,&nbsp;their courage seems to have failed them. They retreated&nbsp;northward along the Etruscan coast, until at Telamon their&nbsp;way was barred by the Roman legions, returning from Sardinia&nbsp;to the defence of Rome, while a second consular army hung&nbsp;upon their rear. Thus hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">but were completely defeated and the flower of their tribesmen slain. The Romans followed up their success by invading the&nbsp;Celtic territory. The Boii were easily reduced to submission.&nbsp;The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately, but by&nbsp;222 the war was over, and all the tribes in the rich&nbsp;Po valley acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. The&nbsp;conquered Celts were not enrolled among the Italian allies&nbsp;of Rome, but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier.&nbsp;Three colonies were founded to hold them in check—Placentia&nbsp;(218) and Cremona in the territory of the Insubres, Mutina (183)*&nbsp;in that of the Boii; and the great northern road (Via Flaminia)&nbsp;was completed as far as the Celtic border at Ariminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the Adriatic coast the immediate interests of Rome were limited to rendering the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with&nbsp;this object that, in 229, the first Roman expedition&nbsp;crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement&nbsp;on the Illyrian pirates of the opposite coast.@@<sup>3 </sup>This expedition&nbsp;was the means of establishing for the first time direct political&nbsp;relations between Rome and the states of Greece proper, to&nbsp;many of which the suppression of piracy in the Adriatic was of&nbsp;as much importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were concluded with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and ApoIIonia; and embassies explaining the reasons which had brought Roman&nbsp;troops into Greece were sent to the Aetolians, the Achaeans,&nbsp;and even to Athens and Corinth. Everywhere they were well&nbsp;received, and the admission of the Romans to the Isthmian&nbsp;games@@<sup>4</sup> (228) formally acknowledged them as the&nbsp;natural allies of the free Greek states against both&nbsp;barbarian tribes and foreign despots. Meanwhile Carthage&nbsp;had acquired a possession which promised to compensate her&nbsp;for the loss of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. The genius of&nbsp;her greatest citizen and soldier, Hamilcar Barca, had appreciated&nbsp;the enormous value of the Spanish peninsula, and conceived&nbsp;the scheme of founding there a Carthaginian dominion which&nbsp;should not only add to the wealth of Carthage, but supply her&nbsp;with a base of operations for a war of revenge with Rome.&nbsp;The conquest of southern and eastern Spain, begun&nbsp;by Hamilcar (236-28) and carried on by his kinsman&nbsp;Hasdrubal (228-21), was completed by his son&nbsp;Hannibal, who, with all his father’s genius, inherited also&nbsp;his father’s hatred of Rome, and by 219 the authority&nbsp;of Carthage had been extended as far as the Ebro&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spain, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font2"> Rome had not watched this rapid advance without anxiety, but, probably owing to her troubles&nbsp;with the Celts, she had contented herself with stipulating (226) that Carthage should not carry her arms&nbsp;beyond the Ebro, so as to threaten Rome’s ancient ally, the&nbsp;Greek Massilia (mod. Marseilles), and with securing the independence of the two nominally Greek communities, Emporiae .&nbsp;and Saguntum,@@<sup>5</sup> on the east coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But these precautions were of no avail against the resolute determination of Hannibal, with whom the conquest of Spain&nbsp;was only preliminary to an attack upon Italy, and who could&nbsp;not afford to leave behind him in Spain a state allied to Rome.&nbsp;In 219, therefore, disregarding the protests of a Roman embassy,&nbsp;he attacked and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had foreseen, rendered a rupture with Rome inevitable, while it set&nbsp;his own hands free for a further advance.</span></p>

In&nbsp;215, moreover, Philip V. of Macedon formed an alliance&nbsp;with Hannibal and threatened to invade Italy; in&nbsp;214 Syracuse revolted, and in 212 the Greek cities&nbsp;in S. Italy went over to Hannibal. But the indomitable spirit</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
