            <p>deposits, they are not willing to open an account under L.10. But few poor persons
                are able to save so large a sum, except by a lengthened course of economy. The truth
                therefore is, that, until savings banks were established, the poor were everywhere
                without the means of securely and profitably investing those small sums which they
                are not unfrequently in a condition to save, and were consequently led, from the
                difficulty of disposing of them, to neglect opportunities of making savings, or, if
                they did make them, were tempted by the offer of high interest to lend them to
                persons of doubtful character and desperate fortune, by whom they were for the most
                part squandered. Under such circumstances, it is plain that nothing could be more
                important in the way of diffusing habits of forethought and economy among the
                labouring classes than the establishment of savings banks, where the smallest sums
                are placed in perfect safety, are accumulated at compound interest, and are paid,
                with their accumulations, the moment they are demanded by the depositors.</p>
            <p>But, notwithstanding the soundness of these views, various objections have been
                stated against these institutions. To a few only of these objections can we at
                present allude.</p>
            <p>It has, for example, been objected to savings banks that the money depositcd in them
                being sent to London and invcsted in national stock, is withdrawn from the spot
                where it was saved, and that thereby that spot is impoverished in proportion to the
                amount of the sum thus transferred. This objection is more specious than solid. In
                the first place, nine tenths of the money invested in savings banks would not be
                saved at all, but spent as it is earned, if these institutions did not exist. The
                savings bank does not transmit to London money already saved. It causes money to be
                saved which otherwise would have been spent. It may be said to <hi rend="italic"
                    >create</hi> money ; and it is only the fund which it creates that it transmits
                to London and invests in national stock. But, in the second place, no man is obliged
                to put his money into a savings bank, and thus to send it to London ; nor will he
                ever dream of doing so, if he can invest it more profitably at home. Profitable and
                safe investment is the sole object, and money is always sure to go where it can be
                most profitably employed. The circumstance of an individual putting his earnings
                into a savings bank, affords a proof that such a mode of investment is regarded by
                him as the most eligible. Besides, he will at once recall it from the savings bank,
                which he is entitled to do, if he find he can invest it elsewhere more profitably.
                The savings bank, therefore, is not merely the parent of saving, but its deposits
                embrace only those sums which cannot be otherwise so profitably employed. It
                withdraws no money from productive industry. It merely embraces funds which cannot
                otherwise be so favourably employed, or which might not have existed, or have been
                placed in improper hands, and lost to the individual.</p>
            <p>But there is no objection, no general or national objection to money being sent to
                London. The money thus disposed of is invested by the National Debt Commissioners,
                as agents, in stock ; which is the same thing as if it were directly invested in
                productive industry. These commissioners, for example, have bought stock with the
                twenty-two millions of money belonging to the savings banks throughout England,
                Wales, and Ireland ; and when they so bought in, other parties must necessarily have
                sold. out. For any given amount of buying there must be an equal amount of selling.
                Now the money thus sold out will not lie idle, because money in a free country never
                lies idle, but will be invested in productive industry ; and it iιs evidently the
                same thing for the country as if the twenty-two millions of the savings banks,
                instead of being converted into stock, had been at once employed in productive
                industry, as the money in the stocks which it displaced is so invested.</p>
            <p>The only other objection of which we shall take notice</p>
            <p>is the following ; namely, that as the money of savings banks goes into the hands of
                government, the minister of the day may avail himself of it, and use it for public
                purposes ; that the depositors have only government security ; and that if a
                revolution should lake place, the funds would all be lost.</p>
            <p>These objections, however formidable in appearance, are in reality quite fanciful and
                untenable. It cannot, with any degree of truth, be said that the money of savings
                banks goes into the hands of government. The money is invested in the Bank of
                England, and the National Debt Commissioners are appointed by law to purchase
                national stock with it. Government does not touch a fraction of the funds. Such
                money no more goes into the hands of the minister of the day, than the funds of any
                corporate body or private individual who purchases stock. Parliament passed a law
                for the encouragement of savings banks, and for the safe custody and increase of
                their funds, which law, under certain conditions, provides that these funds may be
                sent through the Bank of England to the National Debt Commissioners ; that these
                commissioners shall buy stock with them, or, in other words, invest them in
                government securities, and allow the depositors a certain rate of interest, or, at
                their option, to withdraw their funds in full, without reference to the existing
                state of the public securities. Now, these commissioners, when the money comes into
                their hands, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> buy stock with it, and return proper
                vouchers to the savings banks. The commissioners have been exposed to much
                additional labour in consequence of the great spread of savings banks ; but they
                cost these banks nothing ; for though their duty is impcrative, their services are
                gratuitous.</p>
            <p>It is thus evident that the funds of savings banks neither go nor can go into the
                hands of government. The law provides the very reverse. As well might it be said
                that any funds invcsted in national stock has this destination. But though the
                government does not and dares not use one fraction of the funds of these
                institutions, it is undoubtedly security for the money. But can the world afford
                higher security than that of this intelligent, free, and wealthy nation ? As to a
                revolution, the people of this country are too intelligent, and value too much the
                institutions under which they live, to render such an event at all probable ; but
                even should a season of anarchy occur, the constitution lias so much elasticity and
                solidity in it, that, under well-directed public intelligence, it would soon recover
                and right itself. Besides, in all civilized countries, as was recently proved in
                France and Belgium, a revolution generally respects private property. In this case,
                the funds of savings banks would certainly be as secure, indeed we should say a
                great deal more secure, than any other species of property whatever. Besides, the
                very circumstance of a large portion of the people, as the depositors in savings
                banks, having a deep interest in the stability of government, would make them
                constitutionally to resist, not wantonly to promote, civil commotion. “ Every
                person,” says Mr Tidd Pratt, “ who has vested his savings in the public funds, has a
                stake in the security of the country, proportioned not merely to the sum total of
                those savings, but to the value of that sum to himself, and will be deterrcd from
                compassing the disturbance of his native land by a personal motive, added to the
                influence of duty. He will feel the importance of public peace and public credit
                with that strong conviction which individual interest never fails to inspire; and in
                answer to the objections of those who would be jealous of the support thus obtained
                to the ruling powers, it should be observed, that he who possesses property in a
                country is not interested in the stability of the administration for the time being,
                but in the perpetual stability of universal order and good government.”—"(Hist. of
                Savings Banks, p. 2.1, ed. 1830. </p>
