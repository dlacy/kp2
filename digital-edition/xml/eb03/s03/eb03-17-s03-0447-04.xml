a county of England, bounded on the ſouth by Worceſterſhire, Herefordſhire, and Radnorſhire ; on the north, by Cheſhire ; on the eaſt, by Staffordshire ; on the well, by Montgomeryſhire and Denbighshire, in Wales. Its length is between 49 and 50 miles, its breadth about 38, and its circumference about 210. It is an inland county, containing 890,000 acres, 113,680 inhabitants, and 15 hundreds, in which are 170 parishes, and 15 market towns. It makes a part of three biſhoprics, viz. Hereford, Coventry and Litchfield, and St Aſaph. Some part of it lies on the north, and ſome on the ſouth side of the Severn. Beſides the Severn, it is alſo watered by the <hi rend="italic">Temd</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tefidiauc,</hi> as it is called in Welch, which flows from the mountains of Radnorſhire ; and by the Tern, which has its riſe and name from one of thoſe pools called <hi rend="italic">tearnes,</hi> in Staffordshire. All theſe abound with fiſh, eſpecially trouts, pikes, lampreys, graylings, carp, and eels. The air, especially upon the hills, with which the county abounds, is very wholesome. There is as great a diversity of soil as in moſt other counties. On the hills, where it is poor, is very good paſture for ſheep ; and in the low grounds, where it is very rich, along the Severn in particular, there is plenty of graſs for hay and black cattle, with all sorts of corn. No county is better provided with fuel than this, having in it many inexhauſtible pits of coal, and alſo mines of lead and iron. Over moſt of the coal-pits in this county lies a ſtratum or layer of blackiſh porous rock, of which, by grinding and boiling, they make pitch and tar, which are rather better than the common sort for caulking ships, as they do not crack, but always continue close and ſmooth. Quarries of lime-ſtone and iron-ſtone are common enough in the county, and the ſoil in many places is a reddiſh clay. As it lies upon the borders of Wales, it was anciently full of caſtles and walled towns. On the side next that country there was an almoſt continued line of caſtles, to guard the county againſt the inroads and depredations of the Welch. The borders here, as thoſe between England and Scotland, were called <hi rend="italic">marches,</hi> and there were certain noblemen intitled <hi rend="italic">barones marchie, marchiones de marchia Walliae,</hi> “ lords of the marches, or marquisses of the marches of Wales,” who were veſted with a fort of palatine juriſdiction, held courts of juſtice to determine controverſies, and enjoyed many privileges and immunities, the better to enable and encourage them to protect the county againſt the incurſions of the Welch, and to maintain order amongſt the borderers ; but they often abuſed their power, and were the greateſt of tyrants.</p><p>As to the eccleſiaſtical government of the county, the far greater part, namely, all that belongs to the biſhoprics of Hereford, and of Litchfield and Coventry,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0454.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0448"/>
is under the juriſdiction and viſitation of the archdeacon of Shrewſbury or Salop, and is divided into ſeveral deanries.</p><p>The Oxford circuit includes in it this county, which sends 12 members to parliament, viz. two for the ſhire, and two for each of the following towns, Shrewſbury, Ludlow, Wenlock, and Biſhop’s Caſtle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHROVE-Tuesday,</hi> is the Tueſday after Quinquageſima Sunday, or the day immediately preceding the firſt of Lent ; being ſo called from the Saxon word s <hi rend="italic">hrive,</hi> which ſignifies “ to confeſs.” Hence Shrove* Tueſday ſignifies Confeſſion-Tueſday ; on which day all the people in every pariſh throughout England (during the Romiſh times) were obliged to confeſs their ſins, one by one, to their own pariſh-prieſts, in their own pariſhchurches ; and, that this might be done the more regularly, the great bell in every pariſh was rung at ten o’clock (or perhaps ſooner), that it might be heard by all, and that they might attend, according to the custom then in uſe. And though the Romiſh religion has now given way to the Proteſtant religion, the cuſtom of ringing the great bell in our ancient pariſh-churches, at leaſt in ſome of them, ſtill remains, and obtains in and about London the name of Pancake bell ; perhaps, becauſe after the confeſſion it was cuſtomary for the ſeveral perſons to dine on pancakes or fritters. Moſt churches, indeed, have rejected that cuſtom of ringing the bell on Shrove-Tueſday ; but the uſage of dining on pancakes or fritters, and ſuch like proviſion, ſtill continues.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
