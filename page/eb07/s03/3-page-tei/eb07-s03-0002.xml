The consequence of the inquiries was, that the several master-shipwrights were directed to send in proposals for the future established dimensions of the navy ; and in 1745 the Admiralty issued a new establishment for the dimensions of the several ratings of ships. The follow- ing table, taken from Derrick’s Memoirs of the Royal Navy, contains the various established alterations from the reign of Charles II. to this of 1745, which was the last. Since</p><p>then there has been considerable improvement, but there have been no fixed tables as established dimensions, at least none involving all the ratings.</p><p>The ships built after the establishment of 1745 are reported to have been stiff, and to have carried their guns well, but were still inferior to those of the French ; and, consequently, about ten years afterwards an alteration was made in the draughts for the several ratings, and the dimensions were also slightly increased. It may not be uninteresting to remark, that the proportional breadths in the establishment of 1745 considerably exceeded those of more modem ships. Their breadth varied from 100/349 to 100/355 of their lengths ; while, at the present time, with the <hi rend="italic">exception of</hi> those built after the designs of the present sur- veyor of the navy, the breadths of most of our line-of-battle ships are within the limits of 100/361 and 100/385 of their lengths. We merely state this as a historical fact, not as advocating an undue increase of breadth. The question of the re- lative proportions of the dimensions of ships belongs to an- other portion of this article.</p><p>inquiry.
