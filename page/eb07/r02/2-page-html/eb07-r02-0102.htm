<p><span class="font2">guished by a very peculiar vein of dry humour intermingled with a tinge of orientalism in their notions of birth and pride&nbsp;of ancestry and personal dignity, and hence the Spanish&nbsp;novelists seem to have been perfectly alive to the ridiculous&nbsp;features of their countrymen, while sharing very probably in&nbsp;the same exaggerated pretensions themselves. Accordingly,&nbsp;alongwith the adventures of rogues, and beggars, and gipsies,&nbsp;who, during the reigns of the Austrian Philips, appear to have&nbsp;literally swarmed in Madrid, are interspersed ample illustrations of this union of poverty and pride, and the stratagems&nbsp;with which many a pompous cavalier, walking the streets, as&nbsp;Lazaro says, like the Duke of Arcos, is occupied at home in&nbsp;order “ to procure a crust of dry bread, and having eat it,&nbsp;to appear with due decorum in public, by the art of fitting&nbsp;on a ruffle so as to suggest the idea of a shirt, and adjusting&nbsp;a cloak in such a manner as to make it be believed there&nbsp;are clothes under it.”@@<sup>1</sup> Mendoza’s novel contains a sketch&nbsp;of one of these shirtless and famished hidalgos eagerly devouring some crusts which Lazaro had begged in the morning, on pretence of trying whether the bread was sufficiently&nbsp;wholesome, which gives an image of starvation, in which the&nbsp;painful is strangely blended with a sort of sombre gaiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Equal, if not superior to Mendoza’s romance, is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gusman d‘Alfατache</span><span class="font2"> of Matteo Aleman (1599,) which, though dealing in the same gloomy pictures of want and misery, has&nbsp;more variety in its pictures, and a more severe and caustic&nbsp;character in its sarcasm. It has been erroneously supposed to have furnished many particulars to Gil Blas ; in fact,&nbsp;it would be difficult to point out one, except the incident of&nbsp;the parasite who obtains a supper at the expense of the&nbsp;eighth wonder of the world. In the same taste is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gran&nbsp;Tacαno of</span><span class="font2"> Quevedo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The merit of having supplied Le Sage with much of his materials, may be more plausibly claimed by Vicente Espine), the author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vida del Escudero Marcos de Obregon,</span><span class="font2"> printed in 1618. Indeed, while the superior grace, spirit,&nbsp;and gay philosophy of Le Sage are apparent, it is impossible&nbsp;not to make a considerable deduction from his mere invention after reading the w<sup>,</sup>ork of Espinel. The prologue, the&nbsp;adventure of the parasite, the dispersion of the company at&nbsp;Cacabelos by the muleteer, the adventure of the robber’s&nbsp;cave, the surprise by the corsairs, the contributions levied&nbsp;by those pious hermits, Don Raphael and Ambrose de&nbsp;Lamela, the service with the Duke of Lerma, and many&nbsp;of the other incidents, have nearly an exact parallel in the&nbsp;ruder and drier work of Espinel. Even some of the witty&nbsp;points, which we might be disposed at first sight to believe were Le Sage’s, turn out to be the property of the&nbsp;Spanish chaplain ; such as Don Matthias de Silva’s reply,&nbsp;when asked to fight a duel early in the morning, that he&nbsp;never rose before one, even for a party of pleasure, and&nbsp;could not be expected to rise at six to have his throat cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This much, however, must be said for Le Sage, that he shows no desire to conceal the source of his obligations, for&nbsp;one of his characters is termed Marcos Obregon, and the&nbsp;Sangrado of his novel is, undisguisedly, the Sagredo of&nbsp;Espinel. Le Sage, however, knew that after every deduction was made on the score of invention, the merit of his&nbsp;novel would remain much the same. He threw lightness&nbsp;and sunshine into the mean and gloomy pictures of the Spaniards, taking care to efface the recollections of folly and&nbsp;knavery in his adventurers, by a cheerful and respectable&nbsp;termination of their career ; and though the graduation of&nbsp;the fool into the knave, and the knave into the honest man,&nbsp;upon a mere principle of utility, be not perhaps in itself a&nbsp;very lofty moral, it is at all events far more agreeable than&nbsp;that of the Spanish novelists, where the rogue continues such&nbsp;to the last, and his only advancement is to a higher degree&nbsp;in the curriculum of knavery. A romance of a more pleasing and political cast than these tales of knavery, was the&nbsp;historical romance, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Civil Wars of Granada,</span><span class="font2"> by Gines&nbsp;Perez de la Hita, printed in 1604, turning on the dissensions of the Zegris and Abencerrages during the reign of&nbsp;Boabdil, and giving occasion, as might be expected, to&nbsp;many fine descriptions of tournaments, feasts of canes, Moorish palaces and gardens, and the contrast between the Christian and the Moorish chivalry. From this romance Florian has mainly borrowed the idea and materials of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Goη-salvo of Cordova.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One other work offiction deserving notice, though partak-ingmore of the nature of the satire than the novel, is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fray Gerundio</span><span class="font2"> (Friar Gerund) of the Jesuit de l’Isla,—a severe,&nbsp;but rather tedious satire upon the absurdities and bad taste&nbsp;of the popular preachers of the time. In romantic literature&nbsp;the Spaniards at the present day seem to be entirely deficient. Translations of the popular French and English novels&nbsp;abound, but native talent or invention appear to be at an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In France the pastoral romances of D’Urfé and his imitators, and the heroic romances of Gomberville, Scudery, and Calprenede, whose object was “peindre Caton galant et&nbsp;Brutus dameret,” were succeeded by an inundation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">conies&nbsp;des fees</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">voyages imaginaires,</span><span class="font2"> appearing about the close&nbsp;of the seventeenth and the commencement of the eighteenth&nbsp;century. This species of nursery literature, which, like the&nbsp;character of the fair Arricidia in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Clelia,</span><span class="font2"> was “ furieusement&nbsp;extraordinaire et terriblement merveilleux,” seemed peculiarly well suited to the frivolous tastes which then pervaded&nbsp;French society ; and its temporary attraction was perhaps&nbsp;based in some degree upon the very w<sup>,</sup>ant of reason and&nbsp;common sense, which rendered its permanent popularity impossible. When the sage Oglou in Voltaire asked the sultanas “ comment preferez vous des contes que sont sans&nbsp;raison et que ne signifient rien,” the answ<sup>,</sup>er of the sultanas&nbsp;was, “ c’est précisément pour cela que nous les aimons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The chief writers in this school of fiction, with whose compositions mostof us have in our early days been rendered familiar, through the little gilded volumes of Mr. Newberry or his successors, were Perrault, the Countess D’Aulnoy, Madame&nbsp;Murat, and Mademoiselle de laForce,of whom Perrault isde-cidedly the best, his tales being distinguished by a simplicity&nbsp;and naivete of style indispensable in this style of writing, and in&nbsp;which the productions of the ladies are deficient. No great&nbsp;share of original invention is displayed by any of them. The&nbsp;chief storehouse from which they drew was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notti Pia-cevoli</span><span class="font2"> of the Italian novelist Straparola, and the very remarkable Neapolitan collection by Giambattista Basile, entitled the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peηtαmeroηe,</span><span class="font2"> of which the first edition appeared&nbsp;in 1637.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A sightly different direction was given to this taste for marvels by the translation into French of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">daaArabimNights&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by Galland, and of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Persian Tales</span><span class="font2"> by Petit de la Croix&nbsp;and Le Sage, which led to a host of oriental imitations. And&nbsp;the childishness and absurdity of the whole of this department of literature was exposed with great wit and liveliness&nbsp;by Count Antony Hamilton, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fleur &lt;ΓEpiηe,</span><span class="font2"> and in&nbsp;his unfinished tale of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Four Facardins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But this same period was distinguished by the produc- </span><span class="font0">∖</span><span class="font2"> tions of some writers of a higher order : Marivaux, (1688—&nbsp;1763), Prevot, (1697—1763), and Le Sage, (1668—1746).&nbsp;Marivaux had a good deal of Richardson’s power of delicate&nbsp;portrait painting, by an accumulation of miniature touches :&nbsp;nor is he deficient in the power of managing the interesting situations with which his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mariamne</span><span class="font2"> especially abounds.&nbsp;And certainly, if we except Mademoiselle La Fayette’s&nbsp;pleasing romance of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Princess of Cleves,</span><span class="font2"> he may claim&nbsp;the merit of having been the first, in France, to reduce the&nbsp;novel from mere extravagance, both of incident and charac</span></p><div>
