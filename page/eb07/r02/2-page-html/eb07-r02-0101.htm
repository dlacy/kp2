<p><span class="font1">and to the squire the solid riches of his good sense, and his peculiar humour ; that humour, which, as it exists in Cervantes, is among the rarest of human qualities,—the very&nbsp;poetry of the comic, founded on tender sympathy with all&nbsp;forms of existence, though displaying itself in sportive reflection ; and issuing not in superficial laughter, but in still&nbsp;smiles, the source of which lies far deeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The characters and fortunes of these contrasted companions he has linked together in such a way, as to impress on the mind the feeling, how indispensable each is to&nbsp;each, as the complement of the other,—the learning,&nbsp;high-mindedness, and strong imagination of the knight&nbsp;as the creative and moving power in human life ; the&nbsp;practical good sense, and even selfishness, of the squire&nbsp;as the controlling force ; from the judicious union of which&nbsp;opposites arises the harmony, and from their separation the&nbsp;discords of society. He paints also, with great knowledge&nbsp;of human life, the effect which these reciprocal influences,&nbsp;constantly exerted on each other through vicinity and a&nbsp;common pursuit, have in modifying even the original character itself, and gradually making the enthusiast more rational, and the common-place man of the world more imaginative. The sound philosophy, the impartial and kindly&nbsp;spirit with which Cervantes has wrought out this conception,&nbsp;in whichjustice is done at once to the higher and the more&nbsp;common elements of our nature ; the flood of humour with&nbsp;which he surrounded it,—which has tempted many a one&nbsp;since the days of Philip IV. to imitate the pantomime of&nbsp;the student on the banks of the Manzanares,—are as obvious to the least refined of readers, as they are models of&nbsp;art worthy of the admiration and profound study of every&nbsp;writer of fiction. Like human life itself, the story unites&nbsp;and harmonizes the opposite extremes of the pathetic and&nbsp;the ludicrous, the vulgar and the elevated,—for from the&nbsp;midst of the comic ground-work, the striking scenes in the&nbsp;Sierra Morena, the episode of Cardenio and Dorothea, the&nbsp;story of the captive, the sweet pastoral of Marcelia, the marriage of Camacho, and many other passages, rise up, rich in pathos, grandeur, or imagination ; so that, in fact, there is no work&nbsp;in which, while the aim at first might appear to be to destroy the romance of life, passages of more purely romantic&nbsp;beauty are to be found. The truth is, that Cervantes, though&nbsp;anxious to explode avicious tastein literature, was far enough&nbsp;from wishing to direct his satire against the creations of high&nbsp;imagination, or against the spirit of chivalry. The admiration&nbsp;he expressed for Amadis and Palmerin shews, that he was not&nbsp;insensible to the beauties by which even this branch of literature was occasionally redeemed. His own adventurous&nbsp;career of glory and misfortune had, no doubt, deeply impressed upon his mind the contrast between the dreams of&nbsp;imagination and the realities of life ; he saw the poetical&nbsp;capabilities which such a contrast afforded,—and he has&nbsp;painted them with an unshrinking, and some may think a&nbsp;merciless hand. But, even beneath the veil of ridicule with&nbsp;which he has invested his crazed and battered hero, we&nbsp;perceive his own unextinguishable love of the exalted principles by which he is actuated ; and the abiding impression&nbsp;which remains with us after the comic effect of the romance&nbsp;has passed away, is, that truth and nobleness of character&nbsp;will continue to command our love and veneration, though&nbsp;displayed in actions with which the world cannot sympathize, and placing their possessor in situations which excite&nbsp;our ridicule, even while his motives attract our admiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cervantes seems to have intended his moral novels, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Novelas Exemplares),</span><span class="font1"> to be to Spain what the short tales&nbsp;of Boccaccio and his followers had been to Italy, only with&nbsp;the advantage of a purer morality. They are unequal;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">some being mere satirical trifles, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Licentiadο Vidriera;</span><span class="font1"> others, like the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jealous Estremaduran,</span><span class="font1"> (which&nbsp;English readers will recognize in the common farce of the&nbsp;Padlock), the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gipsy,</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish English Lady,</span><span class="font1"> highly&nbsp;interesting in themselves, and characteristic of Spanish&nbsp;manners, laying open to us, as Sismondi says, the hearts&nbsp;and houses of its inhabitants. One novel, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tiaflngidα,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Pretended Aunt,) though undoubtedly written by Cervantes,&nbsp;was not included in the original collection, probably from the&nbsp;disagreeable nature of the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remaining work of fiction by Cervantes, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Persi-les</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sigisrnunda,</span><span class="font1"> is only remarkable as the last work which he wrote, and as being quite as absurd and extravagant as any of those romances of chivalry against which&nbsp;his powerful satire had been directed. No work has occasioned agreater division of opinion. While someof the Spanish&nbsp;critics speak of it in terms of extravagant praise, it is described by Viardot, a French critic, as “a tissue of episodes&nbsp;interlaced with each other, like those of one of Calderon’s intrigues, consisting of extravagant adventures, silly rencontres,&nbsp;astounding prodigies, preposterous characters, and extravagant sentiments.” It retains little or nothing, indeed, of&nbsp;Cervantes, but the charm of his style. Yet, like Corneille&nbsp;placing his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nicomede</span><span class="font1"> before the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cid,</span><span class="font1"> or Milton his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise&nbsp;Regained</span><span class="font1"> before his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost,</span><span class="font1"> Cervantes seems to&nbsp;have given the preference to this child of his old age over&nbsp;the master-piece of his manhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fashion of short novels in the Italian taste, which had been introduced by Cervantes, was followed by Lope,&nbsp;Canizares, Zayas, Montalvan, and by a host of imitators,&nbsp;whose very names the Spanish critic Lampillas declares&nbsp;that he is unable to enumerate. The loss of the catalogue&nbsp;is little to be regretted ; for even among the names which&nbsp;are known, it would be difficult to point out one, even including the great Lope, which rises above mediocrity. Nature, indeed, seems to have given Cervantes his revenge,&nbsp;for the triumph of his rival in the drama, by the failure of&nbsp;Lope as a novelist,—for in this department, the talent and&nbsp;rich invention which he displayed on the stage appeared in&nbsp;a great measure to desert him. The best of his novels is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fortunas de Diana,</span><span class="font1"> (Fortunes of Diana), first printed in the&nbsp;Filoména in 1621; next to which we should place his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">El&nbsp;Zeloso hasta Morir,</span><span class="font1"> (Jealousy till death); but truth to say, neither are remarkable. Indeed, if we except Cervantes, the&nbsp;same remark which we have ventured to make on Lope is&nbsp;generally applicable to the Spanish novelists. Nearly in&nbsp;proportion to the success of the nation in the creation of an&nbsp;original drama, is its signal deficiency in original contributions to the literature of romance. It is not often, indeed,&nbsp;as Tieck remarks in his preface to Bulow’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nοvellenbuch,</span><span class="font1">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that the dramatic and novellistic power are found combined&nbsp;in a national literature to the same extent as in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fact, the only species of prose fiction, with the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote,</span><span class="font1"> in which the Spaniards have displayed any thing like original invention, is in the novels written in what is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gusto Picaresco,</span><span class="font1"> or the romances of roguery, of which the first example of any merit, and,&nbsp;with one exception, the best of the whole series, was furnished by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lazaro de Tarmes</span><span class="font1"> of the celebrated Don&nbsp;Diego de Mendoza, and is said to have been written by him&nbsp;while a student at Salamanca, and first printed in 1553. It&nbsp;is rather singular, no doubt, to find a man of rank devoting&nbsp;himself to these pictures of want and miserable knavery, or&nbsp;a nation affecting so much external pomp and ceremony relishing these exposures of the real filth, meanness, or starvation which often lurked under the cloak of the whiskered&nbsp;Knight of Calatrava. But the Spanish character is distin</span></p><div>
