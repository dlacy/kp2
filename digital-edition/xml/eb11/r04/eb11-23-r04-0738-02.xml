               <p>                   <label>ROSMEAD, HERCULES GEORGE ROBERT ROBINSON</label>,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">1st Baron</hi> (1824-1897), British colonial administrator,
                    was born on the 19th of December 1824. He was of Irish descent on both sides;
                    his father was Admiral Hercules Robinson, his mother a Miss Wood of Rosmead,
                    County Westmeath, from which he afterwards took his title. Passing from
                    Sandhurst into the 87th Foot, he attained the rank of captain; but in 1846,
                    through the influence of Lord Naas, he obtained a post in the Board of Public
                    Works in Ireland, and subsequently became chief commissioner of fairs and
                    markets. His energy in these positions, notably during the famine of 1848, and
                    the clearness and vigour of his reports, secured for him at the age of thirty
                    the office of president of the island of Montserrat. Subsequently he was
                    governor of St Christopher, from 1855 to 1859, when he was knighted in
                    recognition of his services in introducing coolie labour into the island; of
                    Hong-Kong; of Ceylon (K.C.M.G. in 1869); and in 1872 of New South Wales. It fell
                    to his lot to annex the Fiji Islands to the British Empire, and his services
                    were rewarded in 1875 by promotion to G.C.M.G. In 1879 he was transferred to New
                    Zealand, and in 1880 he succeeded Sir Bartle Frere as high commissioner of South
                    Africa. He arrived in South Africa shortly before the disaster of Majuba, and
                    was one of the commissioners for negotiating a peace which was personally
                    distasteful to him. It left him with the task of conciliating on the one hand a
                    Dutch party elated with victory, and on the other hand a British party almost
                    ready to despair of the British connexion. He was called home in 1883 to advise
                    the government on the terms of the new convention concluded with the Transvaal
                    Boers in February 1884. On his return to South Africa he found that a critical
                    situation had arisen in Bechuanaland, where Boer commandoes had seized large
                    tracts of territory and proclaimed the “republics” of Stella and Goshen. They
                    refused to retire within the limits of the Transvaal as defined by the new
                    convention, and Robinson, alive to the necessity of preserving this country—the
                    main road to the north—for Great Britain, determined on vigorous action. John
                    Mackenzie and later Cecil Rhodes were sent to secure the peaceful submission of
                    the Boers, but without immediate result, partly owing to the attitude of the
                    Cape ministry. Robinson’s declaration that the advice of his ministers to patch
                    up a settlement with the filibustering Boers was equivalent to a condonation of
                    crime, led to the expedition of Sir Charles Warren and the annexation of
                    Bechuanaland early in 1885. The difficulties of Robinson’s position were
                    illustrated by the dispute which arose between him and Warren, who declared that
                    the high commissioner’s duties to the home government were at times in conflict
                    with the action which, as governor of Cape Colony, he was bound to take on the
                    advice of his ministers in the interests of the colony. Sir Hercules Robinson
                    succeeded in winning the confidence of President Kruger by his fair-mindedness,
                    while he seconded</p>               <p>Rhodes’s efforts to unite the British and Dutch parties in Cape Colony. His
                    mind, however, was that of the administrator as distinguished from the
                    statesman, and he was content to settle difficulties as they arose. In 1886 he
                    investigated the charges brought against Sir John Pope-Hennessy, governor of
                    Mauritius, and decreed his suspension pending the decision of the home
                    authorities, who eventually reinstated Pope-Hennessy. In 1887 Robinson was
                    induced by Rhodes to give his consent to the conclusion of a treaty with
                    Lobengula which secured British rights in Matabele and Mashona lands. In May
                    1889 Robinson retired. In his farewell speech he declared that there was no
                    permanent place in South Africa for direct Imperial rule. This was interpreted
                    to mean that South Africa must ultimately become independent—an idea repugnant
                    to him. He explained in a letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> in 1895
                    that he had referred to the “ direct rule of Downing Street over the crown
                    colonies, as contrasted with responsible colonial government.” He was made a
                    baronet in 1891. Early in 1895, when he had entered his 71st year and was not in
                    robust health, he yielded to the entreaties of Lord Rosebery’s cabinet, and went
                    out again to South Africa, in succession to Sir H. Loch. His second term of
                    office was not fortunate. The Jameson Raid produced a permanent estrangement
                    between him and Cecil Rhodes, and he was out of sympathy with the new colonial
                    secretary, Mr Chamberlain, who had criticized his appointment, and now desired
                    Robinson to take this opportunity of settling the whole question of the position
                    of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal. Robinson answered that the moment was
                    inopportune, and that he must be left to choose his own time. Alarmed at the
                    imminent danger of war, he confined his efforts to inducing the Johannes-burgers
                    to lay down their arms on condition that the raiders’ lives were spared, not
                    knowing that these terms had already been granted to Jameson. He came home to
                    confer with the government, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Rosmead. He
                    returned to South Africa later in the year, but was compelled by ill-health, in
                    April 1897, to quit his post, and died in London on the 28th of October 1897,
                    being succeeded in the title by his son.</p>
