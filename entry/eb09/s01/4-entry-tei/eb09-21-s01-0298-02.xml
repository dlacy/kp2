a city and bishop’s see of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, on the declivities of the right bank of the Tagus, 46½ miles by rail from Lisbon. It lias the ruins of an old castle, well known in Portuguese history as a royal residence, especially in the Middle Ages, and several of its churches are of historic and architectural interest. A considerable trade is carried on, and the population was 7001 in 1878.</p><p>Santarem, so named after a certain St Irene, is identified with the ancient Scallabis Præsidium Julium. The death of Diniz I., and the birth, abdication, anti death of Don Henrique the cardinal king, all occurred in the city ; it gave its name to João de Santarem, one of the 15th-century navigators ; and Fernando I. and Cabral, discoverer of Brazil, were buried within its walls. The Miguelists were completely routed here by Napier and Villaflor in 1834.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
