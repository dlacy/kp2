<p><span class="font1">to estimate the artistic value of the masterpieces of ancient painting, since time has destroyed the originals, and it is but&nbsp;rarely that , we can even recover the outlines of a famous&nbsp;composition from decorative reproductions. For the history&nbsp;of Greek painting we have in Pliny’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History</span><span class="font1"> a fairly&nbsp;full literary record; but this fails us when we come to Roman&nbsp;times, nor do original works, worthy to be ranked with the&nbsp;monuments of Roman historical sculpture, supply the want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Painting in Italy was throughout its early history dependent on Greek models, and reflected the phases through which the&nbsp;art passed in Greece. Thus the frescoes which adorn the&nbsp;walls of Etruscan chamber-tombs show an unmistakable&nbsp;analogy with Attic vase-paintings. The neutral background,&nbsp;the use of conventional flesh-tones, and the predominant&nbsp;interest shown by the artists in line as opposed to colour,&nbsp;clearly point to the source of their inspiration; and the fine&nbsp;sarcophagus at Florence@@<sup>1</sup> depicting a combat between Greeks&nbsp;and Amazons, in which we first trace the use of naturalistic&nbsp;flesh-tints, though it bears an Etruscan inscription, can hardly&nbsp;have been the handiwork of native artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roman tradition tells of early wall-paintings at Ardea and Lanuvium, which existed “ before the foundation of&nbsp;Rome”;@@<sup>2</sup> of these the Etruscan frescoes mentioned above&nbsp;may serve to give some impression. We also hear of Fabius&nbsp;Pictor, who earned his cognomen by decorating the temple&nbsp;of Salus on the Quirinal (302 </span><span class="font0">B.c.); </span><span class="font1">and a few more names&nbsp;are preserved by Pliny on account of the trivial anecdotes&nbsp;which attached to them. The chief works of specifically&nbsp;Roman painting in Republican times (other than the frescoes&nbsp;which adorned the walls of temples) were those exhibited by&nbsp;successful generals on the occasion of a triumph; thus we&nbsp;hear that in 263 </span><span class="font0">B.c. </span><span class="font1">M. Valerius Messalla was the first to&nbsp;display in the Curia Hostilia such a battle-piece, representing&nbsp;his victory over Hiero II. of Syracuse and the Carthaginians.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>We may perhaps form some idea of these paintings from the&nbsp;fragment of a fresco discovered in a sepulchral vault on the&nbsp;Esquiline in 1889,@@<sup>4</sup> which appears to date from the 3rd century&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> This painting represents scenes from a war between&nbsp;the Romans and an enemy who may almost certainly (from&nbsp;their equipment) be identified as Samnites; the names of&nbsp;the commanders are indicated, and amongst them is a&nbsp;Q. Fabius, probably Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus, who&nbsp;played a part in the third Samnite War. The scenes are&nbsp;superposed in tiers; the background is neutral, the colour-scale simple, and there is but little attempt at perspective;&nbsp;but we note the files of superposed heads in the representation&nbsp;of an army, which are found at a later date in Trajanic&nbsp;sculpture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We pass from this isolated example of early Roman painting to the decorative frescoes of Rome, Herculaneum and Pompeii,&nbsp;which introduce us to the new world conquered by Hellenistic&nbsp;artists. The scheme of colour is no longer conventional, but&nbsp;natural flesh-tints and local colour are employed; the “artist&nbsp;understands,” as Wickhoff puts it, how to “ concentrate the&nbsp;picture in space ” instead of isolating the figures on a neutral&nbsp;background; he struggles (not always successfully) with the&nbsp;difficult problems of linear and aerial perspective, and contrives&nbsp;in many instances to give “ atmosphere ” to his scene; the&nbsp;modelling of his figures is often excellent; finally, he can, when&nbsp;need requires, produce an effective sketch by compendious&nbsp;methods. It must be premised that this style of wall-decoration was a new thing in the Augustan period. In the Hellenistic&nbsp;age the walls of palaces were veneered with slabs of many-coloured marble </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(crustae)',</span><span class="font1"> and in humbler dwellings these were&nbsp;imitated in fresco. This “ incrustation ” style is found in a few&nbsp;houses at Pompeii, such as the Casa di Sallustio, built in the&nbsp;2nd century </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.;</span><span class="font1"> but before the fall of the Republic it had&nbsp;given place to what is known as the “ architectural ” style. In&nbsp;this the painter is no longer content to reproduce in stucco&nbsp;the marble decoration of more sumptuous rooms; by introducing columns and other architectural elements he endeavours&nbsp;to give the illusion of outer space, and this is heightened by the&nbsp;landscapes, peopled, it may be, with figures, which form the&nbsp;background. We shall take as an example of such decoration&nbsp;one of the “ Odyssey landscapes ” discovered on the Esquiline&nbsp;in 1849; these may be amongst the more recent works of this&nbsp;school, but can scarcely, from the character of their surroundings,&nbsp;be later than the reign of Claudius. Amongst the remains of a&nbsp;large private house was a room whose walls were decorated in&nbsp;their upper portion with painted pilasters treated in perspective,&nbsp;through w’hich the spectator appears to look out on a continuous&nbsp;background of land and sea, which is diversified by scenes from&nbsp;the voyage of Odysseus. It is clearly to such works as these&nbsp;that Vitruvius refers in a well-known passage (vii. 5) where, in&nbsp;describing the wall-paintings of his time, he speaks of a class of&nbsp;“ paintings on a large scale which represent images of the gods&nbsp;or unfold mythical tales in due order, as well as the battles of&nbsp;Troy or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the wanderings of Odysseus through landscapes (topia)P&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">And it is*worthy of note that in a chamber discovered in the&nbsp;18th century below the Flavian state-rooms on the Palatine (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome)</span><span class="font1"> the tale of Troy seems to have been represented in a very&nbsp;similar manner; drawings of the panel on which the landing of&nbsp;Helen is depicted have been preserved. Of the eight scenes&nbsp;from the Odyssey found on the Esquiline three represent the&nbsp;adventuroin the country of the Laestrygones; the third forms a&nbsp;transition from this subject to the visit of Odysseus to Circe,&nbsp;which occupies the fourth and fifth panels;<sup>6</sup> the* two last depict&nbsp;Odysseus among the shades. The second of these, which is&nbsp;here reproduced (Plate V. fig. 26), is only half as wide as the&nbsp;others, and was probably next to a door or wdndow. It is,&nbsp;however, typical in style and treatment. The artist is mainly&nbsp;interested in the landscape, which is sketched with great freedom&nbsp;and br.eadth of treatment. He has clearly no scientific knowledge of perspective, and commits the natural error of placing&nbsp;the horizon too high. His figures are identified by Greek&nbsp;inscriptions, and we see that artistic considerations weigh more&nbsp;highly with him than close adherence to his poetical text; for&nbsp;the group of the Danaids in the foreground has no counterpart&nbsp;in the Homeric description. The conventional distinction of&nbsp;flesh-tints between the sexes is to be observed.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">The use of landscape in decoration is expressly stated by Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxv. 116) to have become fashionable in Rome in&nbsp;the time of Augustus. He attributes this to a painter named&nbsp;Studius, who decorated walls with “ villas, harbours, landscape&nbsp;gardens, groves, woods, hills, fish-ponds, canals, rivers, shores,”&nbsp;and so forth, diversified with figures of “ persons on foot or in&nbsp;boats, approaching the villas by land on donkeys or in carriages,&nbsp;as well as fishers and fowlers, hunters and even vintagers.”&nbsp;VitruAdus, too, in the passage above quoted, speaks of “ harbours,&nbsp;capes, shores, springs, straits, temples, groves, mountains, cattle&nbsp;and herdsmen ”; and existing paintings fully confirm the&nbsp;statements of ancient -writers. In the Villa of Livia at Prima&nbsp;Porta the walls of a room are painted in imitation of a park;&nbsp;from the Villa of Fannius Synistor at Bosco Reale we have a&nbsp;variety of landscapes and perspectives; and in the house discovered in the grounds of the Villa Farncsina by the liber we&nbsp;find a room decorated wdth black panels, upon which landscapes&nbsp;exactly conforming to Pliny’s description are sketched in with&nbsp;brush-strokes of white. While we have no reason to dispute the&nbsp;accuracy of Pliny’s statement, or to refuse credit to the Roman&nbsp;artist for the development of landscape decoration, it is to be&nbsp;noted that the summary methods of impressionist technique&nbsp;which are here employed are probably traceable to Alexandrian&nbsp;influence. Petronius, who puts into the mouth of one of his&nbsp;characters a lament over the decline of art, attributes the decadence of painting to the “ audacity of the Egyptians ” and&nbsp;their discovery of “ a short cut to high art ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(tam rnagnae artis&nbsp;Compendiaria).</span><span class="font1"> This has been thought to mean no more than&nbsp;the process of fresco-painting, which led to the substitution of</span></p><div>
