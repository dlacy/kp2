<p><span class="font0">in Schleswig-Holstein. Unfortunately for the peace of the world his habitual policy of maintaining the existing state of&nbsp;things was frequently obscured and disturbed by his desire to&nbsp;maintain and increase his own and his country’s prestige,&nbsp;influence and territory. By the Persian War, which broke out&nbsp;in 1826, in consequence of frontier disputes, he annexed the&nbsp;provinces of Erivan and Nakhichevan, and during the whole&nbsp;of his reign the conquest of the Caucasus was systematically&nbsp;carried on. With regard also to the Ottoman empire his policy&nbsp;cannot be said to have been strictly conservative. As protector&nbsp;of the Orthodox Christians he espoused the cause of&nbsp;the rayahs in Greece, Scrvia and Rumania. Under a&nbsp;threat of war he obtained in 1826 the Convention of&nbsp;Akerman, by which the autonomy of Moldavia, Walachia&nbsp;and Servia was confirmed, free passage of the straits was secured&nbsp;for merchant ships and disputed territory on the Asiatic frontier&nbsp;was annexed, and in July 1827 he signed with England and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">France the treaty of London for the solution of the Greek question by the mediation of the Powers. As the sultan rejected&nbsp;the mediation, his fleet was destroyed by the combined squadrons&nbsp;of the three Powers at Navarino; and as this “ untoward event ”&nbsp;did not suffice to overcome his resistance, a Russian army crossed&nbsp;the Danube and after two hard-fought campaigns advanced to&nbsp;Adrianople. Here, on the 14th of September 1829, was signed&nbsp;a treaty by which the Porte ceded to Russia the islands at the&nbsp;mouth of the Danube and several districts on the Asiatic frontier,&nbsp;granted full liberty to Russian navigation and commerce in the&nbsp;Black Sea, and guaranteed the autonomous rights previously&nbsp;accorded to Moldavia, Walachia and Servia. By the 10th&nbsp;article of the treaty, moreover, Turkey acceded to the protocol&nbsp;of the 22nd of March 1829, by which the Powers had agreed to&nbsp;the erection of Greece into a tributary principality. This attempt&nbsp;of Russia to secure the sole prestige of liberating Greece was,&nbsp;however, frustrated by the action of the other Powers in putting&nbsp;forward the principle of the independence of the new Greek&nbsp;state, with a further extension of frontiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The result of the war was to make Russia supreme at Constantinople; and before long an opportunity of further increasing her influence was created by Mehemet Ali, the ambitious&nbsp;pasha of Egypt, who in November 1831 began a war with his&nbsp;sovereign in Syria, gained a series of victories over the Turkish&nbsp;forces in Asia Minor and threatened Constantinople. Sultan&nbsp;Madmud II. after appealing in vain to Great Britain for active&nbsp;assistance turned in despair to Russia. Nicholas immediately&nbsp;sent his Black Sea fleet into the Bosphorus, landed on the Asiatic&nbsp;shore a force of 10,000 men, and advanced another large force&nbsp;towards the Turkish frontier in Bessarabia. Under pressure from&nbsp;England and France the Egyptians retreated and the;&nbsp;Russian forces were withdrawn, but the tsar had mean*&nbsp;while (July 8, 1833) concluded with the sultan the&nbsp;treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, which constituted ostensibly&nbsp;a defensive and offensive alliance between the two Powers and&nbsp;established virtually a Russian protectorate over Turkey. In&nbsp;a secret article of the treaty the sultan undertook in the event&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">casus foederis</span><span class="font0"> arising, and in consideration of being relieved&nbsp;of his obligations under the articles of the public treaty, to&nbsp;close the Dardanelles to the warships of all nations “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">au besoin”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which meant in effect that in the event of Russia being threatened&nbsp;with an attack from the Mediterranean he would close the&nbsp;Dardanelles against the invader. England and France protested energetically and the treaty remained a dead letter,&nbsp;but the question came up again in 1840, after Mahmud’s renewed&nbsp;attempt to crush Mehemet Ali had ended in the utter defeat&nbsp;of the Turks by Ibrahim at Nezib (June 24, 1839). This time&nbsp;Mehemet Ali was supported by the French government, which&nbsp;aimed at establishing predominant influence in Egypt, but he&nbsp;was successfully opposed by a coalition of Great Britain, Russia,&nbsp;Austria and Prussia, which checkmated the aggressive designs of France by the convention of London (July 15, 1840)&nbsp;(see Mehemet Ali and Turkey). In this way the development&nbsp;of Russian policy with regard to Turkey was checked for some&nbsp;years, but the project of confirming and extending the Russian&nbsp;protectorate over the Orthodox Christians was revived in 1852,&nbsp;when Napoleon III. obtained for the Roman Catholics&nbsp;certain privileges with regard to the Holy Places in&nbsp;Palestine. At the same time Austria intervened in&nbsp;Montenegrin affairs and induced the sultan to withdraw his&nbsp;troops from the principality. In these two incidents the tsar&nbsp;perceived a diminution of Russian prestige and influence in&nbsp;Turkey, and Prince Menshikov was sent on a special mission to&nbsp;Constantinople to obtain reparation in the form of a treaty&nbsp;which should guarantee the rights of the Orthodox Church&nbsp;with regard to the Holy Places and confirm the protectorate&nbsp;of Russia over the Orthodox rayahs, established by the treaties&nbsp;of Kainarji, Bucharest and Adrianople. The resistance of&nbsp;the sultan, supported by Great Britain and France, led to the&nbsp;Crimean War, which was terminated by the taking of&nbsp;Sevastopol (September T855) and the treaty of Paris&nbsp;(March 30,1856). By that important document Russia&nbsp;reluctantly consented to a strict limitation of her armaments in&nbsp;the Black Sea, to withdrawal from the mouths of the Danube&nbsp;by the retrocession of Bessarabia which she had annexed in&nbsp;1812, and finally to a renunciation of all special rights of intervention between the sultan and his Christian subjects. Nicholas&nbsp;did not live to experience this humiliation. He had died at&nbsp;St Petersburg on the 2nd of March 1855 and had been succeeded&nbsp;by his eldest son, Alexander II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first decade of Alexander’s reign is commonly known in Russia as “ the epoch of the great reforms,” and may be described as a violent reaction against the political and&nbsp;intellectual stagnation of the preceding period. The&nbsp;repressive system of Nicholas, in which all other public&nbsp;interests were sacrificed to that of making Russia a great&nbsp;military power, the guardian of order in Europe and the predominant factor in the Eastern Question, had been tried and&nbsp;found wanting. Ending in a military disaster and a diplomatic&nbsp;humiliation, it had failed to attain even the narrow object for&nbsp;which it had been created. This was clearly perceived and&nbsp;keenly felt by the educated classes, and as soon as the strong&nbsp;hand of the uncompromising autocrat was withdrawn, they&nbsp;clamoured loudly for radical changes in the aims and methods&nbsp;of their rulers. Russia must adopt, it was said, those enlightened&nbsp;principles and liberal institutions which made the Western&nbsp;nations superior to her not only in the-arts of peace but even&nbsp;in the art of war; only by imitating her rivals could she hope to&nbsp;overtake and surpass them in the race of progress. On that&nbsp;subject there was wonderful unanimity, and the few persons&nbsp;who could not join in the chorus had the prudence to remain&nbsp;silent. For the first time in the history of Russia public opinion&nbsp;in the modem sense became a power in the state and influenced&nbsp;strongly the policy of the government. Though the young&nbsp;emperor was of too phlegmatic a temperament to be carried&nbsp;away by the prevailing excitement and of too practical a turn&nbsp;of mind to adopt wholesale the doctrinaire theories of his self-constituted, irresponsible advisers, he recognized that great&nbsp;administrative and economic changes were required, and after a&nbsp;short period of hesitation he entered on a series of drastic reforms, of which the most important were the emancipation of&nbsp;the serfs, the thorough reorganization of the judicial administration and the development of local self-government. All these&nbsp;undertakings, in which the humane, liberal-minded autocrat&nbsp;received the sympathy, support and co-operation of the more&nbsp;enlightened of his subjects, were successfully accomplished. The&nbsp;serfs were liberated entirely from the arbitrary rule of the land-owners and became proprietors of the communal land; the old&nbsp;tribunals which could be justly described as “ dens of iniquity&nbsp;and incompetence,” were replaced by civil and criminal law-courts of the French type, in which justice was dispensed by&nbsp;trained jurists according to codified legislation, and from which&nbsp;the traditional bribery and corruption were rigidly excluded; and&nbsp;the administration of local affairs—roads, schools, hospitals, &amp;c.—&nbsp;was entrusted to provincial and district councils freely elected by&nbsp;all classes of the population. In addition to these great and beneficent changes, means were taken for developing more rapidly the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
