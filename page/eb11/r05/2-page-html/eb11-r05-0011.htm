<p><span class="font0">The walls of the church are pierced by windows filled with stained glass of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries and cover&nbsp;more space than is usual even in French Gothic churches. The&nbsp;Portail des Marmousets, the entrance to the south transept,&nbsp;has a projecting porch, behind and above which rises a magnificent rose window. The north façade has no entrance. In&nbsp;the interior, now despoiled of many artistic treasures, there is&nbsp;an organ-case dating from 1630 and a railing of the 18th century&nbsp;surrounding the choir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The church of St Maclou, behind the cathedral, begun in 1437 and finished early in the 16th century, is a rich example&nbsp;of tbe Flamboyant style, the characteristics of which are&nbsp;specially displayed in the decoration of the façade and the&nbsp;tracery of the portal with its five arched openings. It is celebrated for carving attributed to Jean Goujon which appears on&nbsp;the western doors and in other parts of the church, and has a&nbsp;handsome organ-loft reached by a graceful open staircase,&nbsp;and stained glass of the 15th and 16th centuries. The spire&nbsp;above the central tower is modern and was finished in 1869.&nbsp;Close by the church is the old parish cemetery called the Aître&nbsp;de St Maclou; it is surrounded by wooden galleries of the&nbsp;Renaissance period, supported on stone pillars on which are&nbsp;sculptures representing a dance of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The church of St Vincent, near the Seine, is a building of the 16th century and contains the finest stained-glass windows&nbsp;in Rouen; those at the end of the north aisle, by Engrand and&nbsp;Jean le Prince, artists of Beauvais, are the most noted. The&nbsp;stained glass in the churches of St Patrice (16th century) and&nbsp;St Godard (late 15th century) is inferior only to that of St&nbsp;Vincent. Among the less important ecclesiastical buildings&nbsp;of Rouen are the churches of St Gervais, St Romain, St Laurent,&nbsp;St Vivien, and the tower of St André, a relic of an old church&nbsp;of the 15th and 16th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most important secular building in Rouen is the Palais de Justice, once the seat of the exchequer and, later, of the parlement of Normandy. It is in the late Gothic style and consists&nbsp;of a main building flanked by two wings. The left wing, known&nbsp;as the Salle des Procureurs, was erected in 1493 and is remarkable for its lofty barrel-roof of timber. South of the Palais de&nbsp;Justice is the Porte de la Grosse Horloge, an arcade spanning&nbsp;the street and surmounted by a large clock of the 15th century&nbsp;with two dials. The Tour de la Grosse Horloge, which rises&nbsp;beside the arcade, was built in 1389. The tower known as&nbsp;the Tour de Jeanne d’Arc was the scene of her trial, and is&nbsp;all that remains of the castle built by Philip Augustus early&nbsp;in the 13th century. The Porte Guillaume-Lion, opening on to&nbsp;the Quai de Paris, is a handsome gateway built in 1749.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are numerous old houses in Rouen in the Gothic and Renaissance styles. The Hôtel de Bourgtheroulde, the most&nbsp;famous of them, is a stone mansion of the 15th century&nbsp;added to in the reign of Francis I., the façades of which are&nbsp;decorated with bas-reliefs representing scenes from the meeting of the Field of the Cloth of Gold and allegories from the&nbsp;Triumphs of Petrarch. Among more modern buildings are&nbsp;the hôtel de ville of the 18th century, adjoining the north side&nbsp;of the church of St Ouen, the Bourse dating from the same&nbsp;period, and the Musée-Bibliothèque constructed in 1880 and&nbsp;containing rich collections of pictures and ceramics and a&nbsp;library with upwards of 133,000 volumes and many valuable&nbsp;MSS. An important .museum of antiquities and a museum&nbsp;of natural history are contained in the old convent of the&nbsp;Visitation. A statue of the composer F. A. Boïeldieu overlooks&nbsp;the Quai de la Bourse, and one of Pierre Corneille stands at&nbsp;the western extremity of the He Lacroix; both were natives&nbsp;of the town. At Bonsecours, on a hill on the Seine 2 m. above&nbsp;Rouen, are the modern church, which is a resort of pilgrims, and&nbsp;the monument to Joan of Arc consisting of three small Renaissance buildings with a statue of the heroine in the principal one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rouen is the seat of an archbishop, a prefect, a court of appeal and a court of assizes, and headquarters of the III. army corps.&nbsp;Its public institutions also include, a tribunal of first instance,&nbsp;tribunals of commerce and of maritime commerce, a council of&nbsp;trade-arbitration, a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank&nbsp;of France. Among its educational establishments are preparatory&nbsp;schools of medicine and pharmacy, and of higher instruction in&nbsp;science and literature, lycées and training-colleges for both sexes,&nbsp;ecclesiastical seminaries, and schools of commerce and industry, of&nbsp;architecture, music and fine arts. All the more important nations&nbsp;have consulates in the city. Rouen is an important centre for trade&nbsp;in wines, spirits, grain and cattle. Grain, wine, coal, timber and&nbsp;petroleum are leading imports. Besides its manufactures it exports&nbsp;plaster, sugar and sand. The principal industries of Rouen and its&nbsp;district are the spinning and weaving of cotton., notably the manufacture of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouenneries</span><span class="font0"> (cotton fabric woven with dyed yarn), the&nbsp;printing and dyeing.of the manufactured material and the spinning&nbsp;of.flax, hemp and jute; ship-building and the making of braces,&nbsp;shirts, bodices, boots, shoes and hats is also carried.on, and there are&nbsp;distilleries, petroleum-refineries and manufactories of chemicals,&nbsp;soap, machinery, carding-combs and brushes. The port of Rouen&nbsp;comprises the marine docks below the Boïeldieu bridge, and the&nbsp;river dock, the timber dock and the petroleum dock above it. There&nbsp;is also a repairing dock. The Seine is tidal beyond Rouen. The&nbsp;port is accessible for ships drawing 19Ì to 22 J ft. of water, and its&nbsp;quays have a superficial area of about 123 acres. It is served by&nbsp;the lines of the Orleans, the Western and the Northern railway&nbsp;companies, and these, in addition.to the waterways connected with&nbsp;the Seine, make Rouen a convenient centre for the distribution of&nbsp;merchandise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ratu ma</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ratumacos,</span><span class="font0"> the Celtic name of Rouen, was modified by the Romans into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rotomagus,</span><span class="font0"> and by the writers of medieval&nbsp;Latin into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rodomum,</span><span class="font0"> of which the present name is a corruption.&nbsp;Under Caesar and the early emperors the town was the capital&nbsp;of the Veliocasses, a people of secondary rank, and it did not&nbsp;attain to any eminence till it was made the centre of Lugdun-ensis Secunda at the close of the 3rd century, and a little later&nbsp;the seat of an archbishop. Rouen owed much tó its first bishops&nbsp;—from St Mello, the apostle of the region, who flourished&nbsp;about 260, to St Remigius, who died in 772. The bishops built&nbsp;many churches and their tombs became in turn the origin of&nbsp;new sanctuaries. Under Louis le Débonnaire and his successors,&nbsp;the Normans several times sacked the city, but after the treaty&nbsp;of St Clair-sur-Epte in 912, Rouen became the capital of&nbsp;Normandy and attained still greater prosperity. It was the&nbsp;principal residence of the dukes and was the scene in 949 of a&nbsp;victory gained by Duke Richard I. over Otto the Great, emperor&nbsp;of Germany, Louis ¿’Outremer, king of France, and Arnold,&nbsp;count of Flanders. In 1087 William the Conqueror, mortally&nbsp;wounded at Mantes, died at Rouen. The succeeding Norman&nbsp;kings of England tended to neglect Rouen in favour of Caen and&nbsp;afterwards of Poitiers, Lc Mans and Angers; but its monasteries,&nbsp;local trade and manufactures, and the communal organization&nbsp;which the citizens exacted from their sovereigns during the&nbsp;course of the 12th century maintained an importance which is&nbsp;indicated by the building of several fine churches, notably&nbsp;that of St Ouen. In 1203 Rouen was the scene of the murder&nbsp;of Arthur of Brittany at the hands of King John of England.&nbsp;Ostensibly to avenge the crime, Philip Augustus invaded&nbsp;Normandy and entered the capital unopposed. The union of&nbsp;the province with the crown of France in no way hindered&nbsp;the prosperity of the city, for Philip confirmed its communal&nbsp;privileges and built a new castle. A convention between the&nbsp;merchants of Rouen and those of Paris relating to the navigation of the Seine was followed by treaties with London, with&nbsp;the Hanseatic towns and with Flanders and Champagne. In&nbsp;1302 the seat of the exchequer or sovereign court, afterwards&nbsp;the parlement, of Normandy was definitely fixed at Rouen,&nbsp;which had previously shared its sessions with other towns. In&nbsp;1356 Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, a favourite in the city,&nbsp;was arrested within its walls, an event which displeased the&nbsp;inhabitants, who after the disaster at Poitiers supported the&nbsp;cause of Étienne Marcel. The revolt of the Harelle in 1382,&nbsp;caused by the exactions both of the uncles of Charles VI. and&nbsp;of the monks of St Ouen, was followed by heavy punishment.&nbsp;In spite of this a stubborn resistance was offered to Henry V.&nbsp;of England who, after a long siege, occupied the town in 1419.&nbsp;The prosperity of Rouen continued under the English domination, and during this period the greater part of the church of&nbsp;St Ouen was constructed. In 1431 Joan of Arc was tried and&nbsp;burnt in the city. From that year the French began a series of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
