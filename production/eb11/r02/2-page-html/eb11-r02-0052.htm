<p><span class="font1">displayed essential qualities of intellectual freedom, delight in life, exultation over rediscovered earth and man. The note of Renaissance work in Germany was still Gothic. This we feel in the&nbsp;penetrative earnestness of Dürer, in the homeliness of Hans Sachs,&nbsp;in the grotesque humour of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eulenspiegel</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Narrenschiff,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the sombre pregnancy of the Faust legend, the almost stolid mastery&nbsp;of Holbein. It lay not in the German genius to escape from the&nbsp;preoccupations and the limitations of the middle ages, for this&nbsp;reason mainly’ that what we call medieval was to a very large&nbsp;extent Teutonic. But on the Spanish peninsula, in the masterpieces of Velazquez, Cervantes, Camoens<sub>f</sub> Calderon, we emerge&nbsp;into an atmosphere of art, definitely national, distinctly modern,&nbsp;where solid natural forms stand before us realistically modelled,&nbsp;with light and shadow on their rounded outlines, and where the&nbsp;airiest creatures of the fancy take shape and weave a dance of&nbsp;rhythmic, light, incomparable intricacy. The Spanish Renaissance&nbsp;would in itself suffice, if other witnesses were wanting, to prove&nbsp;how inaccurate is the theory that limits this movement to the&nbsp;revival of learning. Touched by Italian influences, enriched and&nbsp;fortified by the new learning, Spanish genius walked firmly forward on&nbsp;its own path. It was only crushed by forces generated in the nation&nbsp;that produced it, by the Inquisition and by despotic Catholic&nbsp;absolutism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the history of the Renaissance, Spain and Portugal represent the exploration of the ocean and the colonization of the other&nbsp;hemisphere. The voyages of Columbus and Vespucci&nbsp;to America, the rounding of the Cape by Diaz and the&nbsp;discovery of the sea road to India by Vasco da Gama,&nbsp;Cortes’s conquest of Mexico and Pizarro’s.conquest of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Peru, marked a new era for the human race and inaugurated the modern age more decisively than any other series of events&nbsp;has done. It has recently, been maintained that modern European&nbsp;history is chiefly an affair of Competitiorf between confederated&nbsp;states for the possession of lands revealed by Columbus and Da&nbsp;Gama. Without challenging or adopting this speculation, it may&nbsp;be safely affirmed that nothing so pregnant of results has happened&nbsp;as this exploration of the globe. To say that it displaced the centre&nbsp;of gravity in politics and commerce, substituting the ocean for the&nbsp;Mediterranean, dethroning Italy from her seat of central importance&nbsp;in traffic, depressing the eastern and elevating the western powers&nbsp;of Europe, opening a path for Anglo-Saxon expansiveness, forcing&nbsp;philosophers and statesmen to regard the Occidental nations as a&nbsp;single group in counterpoise to other groups of nations, the European&nbsp;community as one unit correlated to other units of humanity upon&nbsp;this planet, is truth enough to vindicate the vast significance of&nbsp;these discoveries. The Renaissance, far from being the re-birth&nbsp;of antiquity with its civilization confined to the Mediterranean,&nbsp;with its Hercules’ Pillars beyond which lay Cimmerian darkness,&nbsp;was thus effectively the entrance upon a quite incalculably wider&nbsp;stage of life, on which mankind at large has since enacted one great&nbsp;drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While Spanish navies were exploring the ocean, and Spanish paladins were overturning empires, Charles V. headed the reaction&nbsp;of Catholicism against reform. Stronger as king of Spain&nbsp;than as emperor, for the Empire was Iittlebutaname<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>he lent the weight of his authority to that system of&nbsp;coercion and repression which enslaved Italy, desolated</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Germany with war, and drowned the Low Countries in blood. Philip II., with full approval of the Spanish nation, pursued the same&nbsp;policy in an even stricter spirit. He was powerfully assisted by&nbsp;two institutions, in which the national character of Spain expressed&nbsp;itself, the Inquisition and thé Society of Jesus. Of the former&nbsp;it is not needful to speak here. But we have to observe that the&nbsp;last great phenomenon of the Spanish Renaissance was Ignatius&nbsp;Loyola, who organized the militia by means of which the church&nbsp;worked her Counter-Reformation. His motto, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Perinde ac cadaver,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">expressed that recognition of absolutism which papacy and&nbsp;monarchy demanded for their consolidation (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jesuits</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Loyola).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The logical order of an essay which attempts to show how Renaissance was correlated to Reformation and Counter-Reformation has necessitated the treatment of Italy,&nbsp;Germany and Spain in succession; for these three&nbsp;nations were the three main agents in the triple&nbsp;process to be analysed. It was due to their specific&nbsp;qualities, and to the diverse circumstances of their external&nbsp;development, that the re-birth of Europe took this form of&nbsp;duplex action on the lines of intellectual and moral progress,&nbsp;followed by reaction against mental freedom. We have now to&nbsp;speak of France, which earliest absorbed the influence of the&nbsp;Italian revival, and of England, which received it latest. The&nbsp;Renaissance may be said to have begun in France with Charles&nbsp;VIII.’s expedition to Naples, and to have continued until the&nbsp;extinction of the house of Valois. Louis XII. and Francis I.&nbsp;spent a considerable portion of their reigns in the attempt to&nbsp;secure possession of the Italian provinces they claimed. Henry&nbsp;II.’s queen was Catherine of the Medicean family; and her&nbsp;children, Charles IX. and Henry III., were Italianated Frenchmen. Thus the connexion between France and Italy during&nbsp;the period 1494-1589 was continuous. The French passed to&nbsp;and fro across the Alps on military, and peaceful expeditions.&nbsp;Italians came to France as courtiers, ambassadors, men of&nbsp;business, captains and artists. French society assumed a&nbsp;strong Italian colouring, nor were the manners of the court very&nbsp;different from those of an Italian city, except that externally&nbsp;they remained ruder and less polished. The relation between&nbsp;the crown and its great feudatories, the military bias of the&nbsp;aristocracy, and the marked distinction between classes&nbsp;which survived from the middle ages, rendered France&nbsp;in many vital points unlike Italy. Yet the annals of&nbsp;that age, and the anecdotes retailed by Brantôme, prove&nbsp;that the royalty and nobility of France had been largely&nbsp;Italianized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is said that Louis XII. brought Fra Giocondo of Verona back with him to France, and-founded a school of architects. But we&nbsp;need not have recourse to this legend for the explanation&nbsp;of such Italian influences as were already noticeable&nbsp;in the Renaissance buildings on the Loire. Without&nbsp;determining the French style, Italian intercourse helped&nbsp;to stimulate its formation and development. There are students&nbsp;of the 15th century in France who resent this intrusion of the&nbsp;Italian Renaissance. But they forget that France was bound by&nbsp;inexorable laws of human evolution to obey the impulse which&nbsp;communicated itself to every form of art in Europe. In the school&nbsp;of Fontainebleau, under the patronage of Francis I., that Italian&nbsp;influence made itself distinctly felt; yet a true French manner&nbsp;had been already formed, which, when it was subsequently applied&nbsp;at Paris, preserved a marked national quality. The characteristic&nbsp;of the style developed by Bullant, De TOrme and Lescot, in the&nbsp;royal or princely palaces of Chenonceaux, Chambord, Anet, Écouen,&nbsp;Fontainebleau, the Louvre aud elsewhere, is a blending of capricious&nbsp;fancy and inventive richness of decoration with purity of outline&nbsp;and a large sense of the beauty of extended masses. Beginning&nbsp;with the older castles of Touraine, and passing onward to the&nbsp;Tuileries, we trace the passage from the medieval fortress to the&nbsp;modern pleasure-house, and note how architecture obeyed the&nbsp;special demands of that new phenomenon of Renaissance civilization, the court. In the general distribution of parts these monumental buildings express the peculiar conditions which French&nbsp;society assumed under the influence of Francis 1. and Diane de&nbsp;Poitiers. In details of execution and harmonic combinations they&nbsp;illustrate the precision, logic, lucidity and cheerful spirit of the&nbsp;national genius. Here, as in Lombarcly, a feeling for serene beauty&nbsp;derived from study of thc antique has not interrupted the evolution&nbsp;of a style indigenous to France and eminently characteristic of the&nbsp;French, temperament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the reign of Francis I. several Italian painters of eminence visited France, ^mong these, Del Rosso, Primaticcio, Del Sarto&nbsp;and Da Vinci are the most famous. But their example&nbsp;was not productive of a really great school of French painting. It was left for the Poussins and Claude Lorraine&nbsp;in the next century, acting under mingled Italian and&nbsp;Flemish influences, to embody the still active spirit of&nbsp;the classical revival. These three masters were the contemporaries&nbsp;of Corneille, and do not belong to the Renaissance period. Sculpture, on the contrary, in which art, as in architecture, the medieval&nbsp;French had been surpassed by no other people of Europe, was&nbsp;practised with originality and power in the reigns of Henry II.&nbsp;and Francis I. Ponzio and Cellini, who quitted Italy for France,&nbsp;found themselves OUtrivalled in their own sphere by Jean Goujon,&nbsp;Cousin and Pilon. The decorative sculpture of this epoch, whether&nbsp;combined with architecture or isolated in monumental statuary,&nbsp;ranks for grace and suavity with the best of Sansovino’s. At the&nbsp;same time it is unmistakably inspired by a sense of beauty different&nbsp;from the Italian—more piquant and pointed, less languorous,&nbsp;more mannered perhaps, but with less of empty rhythmical effect.&nbsp;All this while, the minor arts of enamelling, miniature, glass-painting, goldsmith’s work, jewellery, engraving, tapestry, wood-carving,&nbsp;pottery, &amp;c., were cultivated with a spontaneity and freedom which&nbsp;proved that France, in the middle point between Flanders and Italy,&nbsp;was able to use both influences without a sacrifice of native taste.&nbsp;It may indeed be said in general that what is true of France is&nbsp;likewise true of all countries which felt the artistic impulses of&nbsp;the Renaissance. Whether we regard Spain, the Netherlands, or&nbsp;Germany at this epoch, we find a national impress stamped upon&nbsp;the products of the plastic and the decorative arts, notwithstanding&nbsp;the prevalence of certain forms derived from the antique and Italy.&nbsp;It was only at a later period that the formalism of pseudo-classic&nbsp;pedantry reduced natural and national originality to a dead&nbsp;unanimity.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
