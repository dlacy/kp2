Under the Greeks Sogdiana was united in one satrapy with Bactria, and subsequently it formed part of the Bactrian Greek kingdom till the “ Scythians ” (the Yue-chi) occupied it in the middle of the 2d century b.c. (comp. vol. xviii. pp. 586 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 592 <hi rend="italic">sqj).</hi> The valley of the Zarafshan about Samarkand retained even in the Middle Ages the name of the Soghd of Samarkand. Arabic geographers reckon it as one of the four fairest spots in the world.</p><p>ṠOḤÁR, the second port of ‘Omán, Arabia, situated on the Gulf of ‘Omán in 24° 22' N. lat. and 56° 45' E. long. It is a place of considerable trade and industry, well built, fortified with walls and a castle, and inhabited by a hospitable and far from bigoted population of the Íbádí sect. The anchorage is good, sheltered between two promontories, and the surrounding country is populous and fertile. Indeed the coast-land of ‘Omán is naturally the most favoured part of Arabia.</p><p>The town of Ṡoḥár is older than Islam, and its cloths are mentioned in the life of Mohammed (Ibn Hisham, p. 1019). Before the Moslem conquest it was in the hands of the Persians, and the Persian name Mazūn is not uncommonly applied to it by older Arabic writers. Under Islam it became the capital of Oman, and it is sometimes called Oman, from which fact it has sometimes, but very precariously, been identified with the Omana of classical writers. In the earlier Middle Ages Ṡoḥár was one of the first commercial cities of Islam on the Indian Ocean and had an active part in the China trade. This prosperity was unabated when Mokaddasi wrote of it (p. 92) towards the close of the 10th century; in the 12th century, when Edrísí wrote, the China trade was a thing of the past ; and about 1230 Ibn Mojáwir describes it as a ruin inhabited by the demons of the desert. Its decay appears to be connected with the rise of other ports—Ralliât on the Arabian and Ormuz on the Persian side of the Persian Gulf—but more especially with the political convulsions of Om'án. This district, which has always had an isolated position in Eastern history, early became a stronghold of the Khawárij (Ib'áḍíya) and paid very intermittent obedience to the caliphs till it was reduced by Mo'ta'ḍid about the year 900. Even after this conquest the native imáms held their ground in the mountainous inland country at Nazwa (Iṡṭakhrí, p. 26), and renewed the struggle for independence with the Buwaihid and Seljuk sovereigns of Fars, who succeeded in these regions to the power of the caliphate. Ibn Mojáwir connects the destruction of Ṡoḥár with these struggles, and, though he seems to imply a later date, it is possible that his statement is to be combined with what Ibn al-Athír (ix. 387) tells of the rising of Al-Rásliid billáh about 1050. After this event there is a period of obscurity in the annals of ''Omán ; the independence of the country was ultimately secured under the native (Azdite) princes of Nazwa, but Ṣoḥár never recovered its importance. It is mentioned, however, by Marco Polo, under the name of Soer, as trading in horses with Malabar, and also by Ibn Batuta, and must therefore have been resettled soon after the time of Ibn Mojáwir. Ṡoḥâr was seized by</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s05-0247" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0263.jp2"/><p>the Portuguese in 1508 and held by them till about 1650. In the 18th century Niebuhr speaks of it as a quite unimportant place ; Wellsted in 1836 assigned to it a population of 9000 ; Palgrave in 1863 estimated the population at 24,000, an estimate the more remarkable that in the interval the town had suffered severely from the Wahhabis. The <hi rend="italic">Red Sea Pilot</hi> (1883) gives the more probable figure of 4000 to 5000.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
