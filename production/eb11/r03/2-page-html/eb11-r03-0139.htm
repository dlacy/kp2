<p><span class="font0">later as the Jacobin Club, which had consisted originally of the Breton deputies only, but which, after the Assembly moved&nbsp;to Paris, began to admit among its members various'leaders&nbsp;of the Parisian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeoisie,</span><span class="font0"> As time went on, many of the&nbsp;more intelligent artisans and small shopkeepers became members&nbsp;of the club, and among such men Robespierre found the hearers&nbsp;he sought. They did more than listen to him: they idolized&nbsp;him; the fanatical leader had found followers. As the wealthier&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeois</span><span class="font0"> of Paris and deputies of a more moderate type seceded&nbsp;to the club of ’89, the influence of the old leaders of the&nbsp;Jacobins (Barnave, Duport, Alexandre de Lameth) diminished;&nbsp;and when they themselves, alarmed at the progress of the&nbsp;Revolution, founded the club of the Feuillants in 1791, the&nbsp;followers of Robespierre dominated the Jacobin Club. The&nbsp;death of Mirabeau strengthened Robespierre'S influence in the&nbsp;Assembly; but on the 15th of May 1791 he proved his lack of&nbsp;statesmanlike insight and his jealous suspicion of his colleagues&nbsp;by proposing and carrying the motion that no deputies who&nbsp;sat in the Constituent could sit in the succeeding Assembly.&nbsp;The flight of the king on the 20th of June and his arrest at&nbsp;Varennes made Robespierre declare himself at the Jacobin&nbsp;Club to be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ni monarchiste ni républicain.</span><span class="font0"> After the “ massacre ”&nbsp;of the Champ de Mars (on the 17th of July 1791) he established&nbsp;himself, in order to be nearer to the Assembly and the Jacobins,&nbsp;in the house of Duplay, a cabinetmaker in the Rue St Honoré,&nbsp;and an ardent admirer of his, where he lived (with but two&nbsp;short intervals) till his death. At last came his day of triumph,&nbsp;when on the 30th of September, on the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the people of Paris crowned Pétion and&nbsp;himself as the two incorruptible patriots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the dissolution of the Assembly he returned for a short visit to Arras, where he met with a triumphant reception. In&nbsp;November he returned to Paris, and on the 18th of December&nbsp;made a speech which marks a new epoch in his life. Brissot&nbsp;de Warville, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">âme politique</span><span class="font0"> of the Girondin party which had&nbsp;been formed in the Legislative Assembly, urged vehemently&nbsp;that war* should be declared against Austria, and the queen&nbsp;was equally urgent, in the hope that a victorious army might&nbsp;restore the old absolutism of the Bourbons. Two men opposed&nbsp;the projects of the queen and the Girondins—Marat and&nbsp;Robespierre. Robespierre feared a development of militarism,&nbsp;which might be turned to the advantage of the reaction. This&nbsp;opposition from those whom they had expected to aid them&nbsp;irritated the Girondins greatly, and from that moment began&nbsp;the struggle which ended in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coups Petal</span><span class="font0"> of the 31st of May&nbsp;and the 2nd of June 1793. Robespierre persisted in his opposition to the war; the Girondins, especially Brissot, attacked&nbsp;him violently; and in April 1792, he resigned the post of public&nbsp;prosecutor at the tribunal of Paris, which he had held since&nbsp;February, and started a journal, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Défenseur de la Constitution,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in his own defence. It is noteworthy that during the summer&nbsp;months of 1792 in which the fate of the Bourbon dynasty&nbsp;was being sealed, neither the Girondins in the Legislative Assembly nor Robespierre took any active part in overthrowing&nbsp;it. Stronger men with practical instincts of statesmanship,&nbsp;like Danton and Billaud-Varenne, who dared to look facts in&nbsp;the face and take the responsibility of doing while others were&nbsp;talking, were the men who made the 10th of August and took&nbsp;the Tuileries. The Girondins, however, were quite ready to&nbsp;take advantage of the accomplished fact; and Robespierre,&nbsp;likewise, though shocked at the shedding of blood, was willing&nbsp;to take his seat on the Commune of Paris, which had overthrown&nbsp;Louis XVI., and might check the Girondins. The strong men&nbsp;of the Commune were glad to have Robespierre’s assistance,&nbsp;not because they cared for him or believed in him, but because&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the help got from his popularity, his reputation for virtue,&nbsp;which had won for him the surname of “ The Incorruptible,”&nbsp;and his influence over the Jacobin Club and its branches, which&nbsp;spread all over France. He it was who presented the petition&nbsp;of the Commune of Paris on 16th August to the Legislative&nbsp;Assembly, demanding the establishment of a revolutionary&nbsp;tribunal and the summoning of a Convention. The massacres&nbsp;of September in the prisons, which Robespierre in vain attempted to stop, showed that the Commune had more confidence&nbsp;in Billaud than in him. Yet, as a proof of his personal popularity, he was a few days later elected first deputy for Paris&nbsp;to the National Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the meeting of the Convention the Girondins immediately attacked Robespierre; they were jealous of his influence in&nbsp;Paris, and knew that his single-hearted fanaticism would never&nbsp;forgive their intrigues with the king at the end of July. As&nbsp;early as the 26th of September the Girondin M. D. A. Lasource&nbsp;accused him of aiming at the dictatorship; afterwards lie was&nbsp;informed that Marat, Danton and himself were plotting to become triumvirs; and eventually on the 29th of October Louvet&nbsp;de Couvrai attacked him in a studied and declamatory harangue,&nbsp;abounding in ridiculous falsehoods and obviously concocted&nbsp;in Madame Roland’s boudoir. But Robespierre had no difficulty in rebutting this attack (5th of November), while he&nbsp;denounced the federalist plans of the Girondins. All personal&nbsp;disputes, however, gave way by the month of December 1792&nbsp;before the‘great question of the king’s trial, and here Robespierre took up a position which is at least easily understood.&nbsp;These are his words spoken on the 3rd of December: “ This&nbsp;is no trial; Louis is not a prisoner at the bar; you arc not&nbsp;judges; you are—you cannot but be—statesmen, and the&nbsp;representatives of the nation. You have not to pass sentence&nbsp;for or against a single man, but you have to take a resolution&nbsp;on a question of the public safety, arid to decide a question of&nbsp;national foresight. It is with regret that I pronounce the&nbsp;fatal truth: Louis ought to perish rather than a hundred&nbsp;thousand virtuous citizens; Louis must die, that the country&nbsp;may live.” This great question settled by the king’s execution,&nbsp;the struggle between Robespierre and the Girondins entered&nbsp;upon a more acute stage, and the want of statesmanship among&nbsp;the latter threw upon the side of the fanatical Robespierre&nbsp;Danton and all those strong practical men who cared little&nbsp;for personal questions, and whose only desire was the victory&nbsp;of France in her great struggle with Europe. Had it been at&nbsp;all possible to act with that group of men of genius whom&nbsp;history calls the Girondins, Danton, Lazare Carnot, Robert&nbsp;Lindet, and even Billaud-Varenne, would have sooner thrown&nbsp;in their lot with them than with Robespierre, whom they&nbsp;thoroughly understood; but the Girondins, spurred on by&nbsp;Madame Roland, refused to have anything to do with Danton.&nbsp;Government became impossible; the federalist idea, which&nbsp;would have broken France to pieces in the very face of the&nbsp;enemy, grew and flourished, and the men of action had to take&nbsp;a decided part. In the month of May 1793 Camille Desmoulins,&nbsp;acting under the inspiration of Robespierre and Danton,&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire des Brissolins</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brissot démasqué}&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Maximin Isnard declared that Paris must be destroyed if it&nbsp;pronounced itself against the provincial deputies; Robespierre&nbsp;preached insurrection at the Jacobin Club; and on the 31st of&nbsp;May and the 2nd of June the Commune of Paris destroyed the&nbsp;Girondin party. For a moment it seemed as if France would&nbsp;avenge them; but patriotism was stronger than federalism.&nbsp;The defence of Lyons exasperated the men who were working&nbsp;for France, and the armies who were fighting for her, and&nbsp;on the 27th of July 1793, when the struggle was practically&nbsp;decided, the Convention elected Robespierre to the new Committee of Public Safety. Hc had not solicited, so it seems,&nbsp;nor even desired this election, yet it marks an important epoch,&nbsp;not only in the life of Robespierre, but in the history of the&nbsp;Revolution. Danton and the men of action had throughout&nbsp;the last two years of the crisis, as Miraheau had in the first&nbsp;two years, seen that the one great need of France, if she was&nbsp;to see the end of her troubles without the interference of foreign&nbsp;armies, was the existence of a strong executive government.&nbsp;The means for establishing the much-needed strong executive&nbsp;were found in the Committee of Public Safety. The success&nbsp;of this Committee in suppressing the Norman insurrection had&nbsp;confirmed the majority of the Convention in the expediency&nbsp;of strengthening its powers, and the Committee of General</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
