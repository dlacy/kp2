It muſt therefore be the ſame over the whole of any one inclined plane. We ſhall anſwer theſe conditions exactly, if we take for the meaſure of a ſlope the fraction which ex-preſſes the elevation of one extremity above the other</p><p>divided by the length of the plane. Thus will AF</p><p>expreſs the declivity of the plane AF.</p><p>If the water met with no reſiſtance from the bed in which it runs, if it had no adheſion to its ſides and bottom, and if its fluidity were perfect, its gravity would accelerate its courſe continually, and the earth and its inhabitants would be deprived of all the advantages which they derive from its numberleſs ſtreams. They would run off ſo quickly, that our fields, dried up as ſoon as watered, would be barren and uſeleſs. No ſoil could reſiſt the impetuoſity of the torrents ; and their accelerating force would render them a deſtroying ſcourge, were it not that, by kind Providence, the reſiſtance of the bed, and the viſcidity of the fluid, become a check which reins them in and ſets bounds to their rapidity. In this manner the friction on the ſides, which, by the viſcidity of the water, is communicated to the whole maſs, and the very adheſion of the particles to each other, and to the ſides of the channel, are the cauſes which make the reſiſtances bear a relation to the velocity ; ſo that the reſiſtances augmenting with the velocities, come at laſt to balance the accelerating force. Then the velocity now acquired is preſerved, and the motion becomes uniform, without being able to acquire new increaſe, unleſs ſome change ſucceeds either in the ſlope or in the capacity of the channel. Hence ariſes the ſecond maxim in the motion of rivers, that <hi rend="italic">when a ſtream moves uniformly, the reſiſtance is equal to the accelerating force.</hi></p><p>As in the efflux of water through orifices, we pafs over the very beginnings of the accelerated motion, which is a matter of ſpeculative curioſity, and conſider the motion in a ſtate of permanency, depending on the head of water, the area of the orifice, the velocity, and the expence ; ſo, in the theory of the uniform motion of rivers, we conſider the ſlope, the tranſverſe fection or area of the ſtream, the uniform velocity, and the ex</p><lb/><p>pence. It will be convenient to affix preciſe meanings to the terms which we ſhall employ.</p><p>The section of a ſtream is the area of a plane per* pendicular to the direction of the general motion.</p><p>The reſiſtances ariſe ultimately from the action of the water on the internal ſurſace of the channel, and muſt be proportional <hi rend="italic">( firteris paribus )</hi>  to the extent of the action. Therefore if we unfold the whole edge of this ſection, which is rubbed as it were by the paſſing water, we ſhall have a meaſure of the extent of this action. In a pipe, circular or priſmatical, the whole circumference is acted on; but in a river or canal ACDQ (fig. 6.) the horizontal line <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  O <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>  which makes the upper boundary of the ie&lt;5tiυn <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  Cl) <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>  is free from all action. The action is confined to the three lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  C, CD, D <hi rend="italic">e. </hi>We ſhall call this line <hi rend="italic">a</hi>  CD <hi rend="italic">e</hi>  the border of the ſection.</p><p>The mean velocity is that with which the whole ſection, moving equally, would generate a ſolid equal to the expence of the ſtream. This velocity is to be found perhaps but in one filament of the ſtream, and we do not know in which filament it is to be found.</p><p>Since we are attempting to eſtabliſh an empirical theory of the motion of rivers, founded entirely on experiment and palpable deductions from them ; and ſince it is extremely difficult to make experiments on open ſtreams which ſhall have a preciſion ſufficient for ſuch an important purpoſe—it would be a moil deſirable thing to demonſtrate an exact analogy between the mutual balancing of the acceleration and reſiſtance irι pipes and in rivers ; for in thoſe we can not only make experiments with all the deſired accuracy, and admitting preciſe meaſures, but we can make them in a number of caſes that are almoſt impracticable in rivers. We can increaſe the ſlope of a pipe from nothing to the vertical poſition, and we can employ every deſired degree of preſſure, ſo as to aſcertain its effect on the velocity in degrees which open ſtreams will not admit. The Chevalier de Buat has moſt happily ſucceeded in this demonſtration;-and it is here that his good fortune and his penetration have done ſo much ſervice to practical ſcience.</p><p>Let AB (fig. 7.) be a horizontal tube, through which the water is impelled by the preſſure or head DA. This head is the moving power ; and it may be conceived as conliſting of two parts, performing two diſtinct offices. One of them is employed in impreſ-ſing on the water that velocity with which it <hi rend="italic">actually moves</hi>  in the tube. Were there no obſtructions to this motion, no greater head would be wanted ; but there are obſtructions ariſing from friction, adheſion, and viſcidity. This requires force. Let this be the office of the reſt of the head of water in the reſervoir. There is but one allotment, appropriation, or repartition, of the whole head which will anſwer. Suppoſe E to be the point of partition, ſo that DE is the head neceſſary for impreſſing the actual velocity on the water (a head or preſſure which has a relation to the form or circumſtance of the entry, and the contraction which takes place there). The reſt EA is wholly employed in overcoming the ſimultaneous reſiſtances which take place along the whole tube AB, and is in equilibrio with this reſiſtance. Therefore if we apply at E a tube EC of the ſame length and diameter with AB,</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
