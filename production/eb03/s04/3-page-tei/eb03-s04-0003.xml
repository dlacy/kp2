            <p>Theſe ſevere winters are rapidly ſuceeeded by ſummers, in which the heat is ſo
                intenſe that the Tunguſians, who live in the province of Jakutſk, go almoſt naked.
                Here is ſcarcely any night during that ſeaſon ; and towards the Frozen Ocean the ſun
                appears continually above the horizon. The vegetables and fruits of the earth are
                here extremely quick in their growth.</p>
            <p>The whole track of land beyond the 60th degree of north latitude is a barren waſte ;
                for the north part of Siberia yields neither corn nor fruits ; though barley is
                known frequently to come to perfection in Jakutſk.— For this reaſon, the inhabitants
                of the northern parts are obliged to live on fiſh and fleſh, but the Russians are
                ſupplied with corn from the ſouthern parts of Siberia, where the soil is
                ſurpriſingly fertile. The countries beyond the lake of Baikal, especially towards
                the eaſt, as far as the river Argun, are remarkably fruitful and pleaſant ; but ſuch
                is the indolence of the inhabitants, that ſeveral fine tracts of land, which would
                make ample returns to the peaſant for cultivating them, lie neglected. The paſtures
                are excellent in this country, which abounds in fine horned cattle, horses, goats,
                &amp;c. on which the Tartars chiefly depend for ſubſiſtence. How</p>
            <p>ever, there are ſeveral ſteppes, or barren waſtes, and unimprovable tracts in theſe
                parts ; and not a single fruit tree is to be ſeen. There is great variety of
                vegetables, and in ſeveral places, particularly near Kraſnaia Sloboda, the ground is
                in a manner overrun with aſparagus of an extraordinary height and delicious flavour.
                The bulbs of the Turkiſh bundes, and other forts of lilies, are much uſed by the
                Tartars inſtead of bread. This want of fruit and corn is richly compenſated by the
                great quantities of wild and tame beaſts, and fowls, and the infinite variety of
                fine fiſh which the country affords @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
            <p>In that part of Siberia which lies near the Ice Sea, as well as in ſeveral other
                places, are woods of pine, larch, and other trees ; beſides which, a conſiderable
                quantity of wood is thrown aſhore by the waves of the Ice Sea; but whence it comes
                is not yet aſcertained.</p>
            <p>Beſides the wild fowl with which Siberia abounds, there is a prodigious number of
                quadrupeds, ſome of which are eatable, and others valuable for their ſkins or
                furs.</p>
            <p>The animals moſt valued for their ſkins are the black</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(b)</hi> The oak, though frequent in Ruſſia, it is ſaid, is
                not to be found through this vaſt region nearer than, the banks of the Argun and
                Amur, in the dominions of China. The white poplar, the aspen, the black poplar, the
                common ſallow, and ſeveral ſpecies of the willow, are very common. The Norway and
                ſilver fir form great foreſts ; but the former does not grow beyond the 60th degree
                of north latitude, and the latter not beyond 5.8 degrees. To this dreary region of
                Siberia, Europe is indebted for that excellent ſpecies of oats called Av<hi
                    rend="italic">ena Sibirica,</hi> and our gardens are enlivened with the gay and
                brilliant flowers brought from the same country.</p>
