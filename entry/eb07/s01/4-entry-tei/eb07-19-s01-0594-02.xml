a town of the mountainous district of Yemen, in Arabia, and the most important in the district. It is the residence of an imam or chief, whose power is limited, and his territories small ; and he is often so hard pressed by his highland neighbours that he finds it difficult to maintain his ground. He imposes a duty on all goods passing from Yemen into the interior of Arabia, and from this source his revenue chiefly arises. It is 368 miles north-north-east of Mocha.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
