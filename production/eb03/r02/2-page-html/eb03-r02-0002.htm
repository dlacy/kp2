<p><span class="font0">almoſt entirely occupied by the Saracens; Andronicus the eaſtern emperor poſſeſſing little more in it than a&nbsp;caſtle. Neverthleſs he refuſed to grant the inveſtiture&nbsp;of the iſland to Villaret. The latter, without ſpending time in fruitleſs negociations, ſailed directly for&nbsp;Rhodes, where he landed his troops, proviſions, and&nbsp;warlike ſtores, in ſpite of the oppoſition made by the&nbsp;Saracens, who then united againſt the common enemy.&nbsp;As Villaret foreſaw that the capital muſt be taken before he could reduce the iſland, he inſtantly laid ſiege&nbsp;to it. The inhabitants defended themſelves obſtinately,&nbsp;upon which the grand-maſter thought proper to turn&nbsp;the ſiege into a blockade; but he ſoon found himſelf&nbsp;ſo cloſely ſurrounded by the Greeks and Saracens, that&nbsp;he could get no ſupply either of forage or proviſions&nbsp;for his army. But having at length obtained a ſupply&nbsp;of proviſions by means of large ſums borrowed of the&nbsp;Florentines, he came out of his trenches and attacked&nbsp;the Saracens, with a full reſolution either to conquer&nbsp;or die. A bloody fight enſued, in which a great number of the braveſt knights were killed: but at length the&nbsp;Saracens gave way, and fled to their ſhips; upon which&nbsp;the city was immediately aſſaulted and taken. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Greeks and other Chriſtians had their lives and liberties given them, but the Saracens were all cut to pieces. The reduction of the capital was followed by that of&nbsp;all the other places of inferior ſtrength throughout the&nbsp;iſland; and in four years after their landing, the whole&nbsp;was ſubjugated, and the conquerors took the title of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knights of Rhodes.</span><span class="font0"> For many years thoſe knights&nbsp;continued the terror of the Saracens and Turks, and&nbsp;ſuſtained a ſevere ſiege from Mohammed II. who was&nbsp;compelled to abandon the enterpriſe; but at length&nbsp;the Turkiſh ſultan Solyman reſolved at all events to&nbsp;drive them from it. Before he undertook the expedition, he ſent a meſſage commanding them to depart the&nbsp;iſland without delay; in which caſe he promiſed that&nbsp;neither they nor the inhabitants ſhould ſuffer any injury,&nbsp;but threatened them with his utmoſt vengeance if they&nbsp;refuſed his offer. The knights, however, proving ob-ſtinate, Solyman attacked the city with a fleet of 400&nbsp;ſail and an army of 140, 000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The trenches were ſoon brought cloſe to the coun-terſcarp, and a ſtrong battery raiſed againſt the town; which, however, did but little damage, till the ſultan&nbsp;being informed by a ſpy of this particular, and that&nbsp;he was in danger of receiving ſome fatal ſhot from the&nbsp;tower of St John which overlooked his camp, he planted a battery againſt that tower, and quickly brought&nbsp;it down. Solyman, however, finding the whole place&nbsp;in ſome meaſure covered with ſtrong fortifications of&nbsp;ſuch height as to command all his batteries, ordered an&nbsp;immenſe quantity of ſtones and earth to be brought; in&nbsp;which ſo great a number of hands were employed night&nbsp;and day by turns, that they quickly raiſed a couple of&nbsp;hillocks high enough to overtop the city-walls. They&nbsp;plied them accordingly with ſuch a continual fire, that&nbsp;the grand-maſter was obliged to cauſe them to be ſtrongly&nbsp;propped within with earth and timber. All this while the&nbsp;beſieged, who, from the top of the grand-maſter’s palace, could diſcover how their batteries were planted, de-moliſhed them with their cannon almoſt as faſt as they&nbsp;raiſed them.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font1">Here the enemy thought proper to alter their measures, and to plant a ſtrong battery againſt the tower of</span></h3><div>
<p><span class="font0">St Nicholas, which, in the former ſiege by Mohammed, had reſiſted all the efforts of the then grand-vizier.&nbsp;This the baſhaw of Romania cauſed to be battered with&nbsp;12 large pieces of braſs cannon, but had the mortification to ſee them all diſmounted by thoſe of the tower;&nbsp;to prevent which in future, he ordered them to be fired&nbsp;only in the night, and in the day had them covered&nbsp;with gabions and earth. This had ſuch ſucceſs, that,&nbsp;alter 500 cannon-ſhot, the wall began to ſhake and&nbsp;tumble into the ditch; but he was ſurpriſed to find another wall behind it, well terraced, and bordered with&nbsp;artillery, and himſelf obliged either to begin afreſh or&nbsp;give up the enterpriſe: and yet this laſt was what Soly-ιhan preferred, when he was told of its being built on&nbsp;a hard rock, incapable of being ſapped, and how firmly&nbsp;it had held out againſt all the effort of Mohammed’s&nbsp;vizier. The next attack was therefore ordered by him&nbsp;to be made againſt the baſtions of the town, and that&nbsp;with a vaſt number of the largeſt artillery, which continued firing during a whole month; ſo that the new&nbsp;wall of the baſtion of England was quite demoliſhed,&nbsp;though the old one ſtood proof againſt all their ſhot.&nbsp;That of Italy, which was battered by 17 large pieces&nbsp;of cannon, was ſtill worſe damaged; upon which Mar-tinengo the engineer adviſed the grand-maſter to cauſe&nbsp;a ſally to be made on the trenches of the enemy out</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the breach, whilſt he was making freſh entrenchments behind it. His advice ſucceeded; and the 200 men that ſallied out ſword in hand having ſurpriſed&nbsp;the Turks in the trench, cut moſt of them in pieces.&nbsp;At the ſame time a new detachment, which was ſent&nbsp;to repulſe them, being obliged, as that engineer rightly&nbsp;judged, to paſs by a ſpot which lay open to their artillery, were likewiſe moſtly deſtroyed by the continual fire that came from it, whilſt the aſſailants were&nbsp;employed in filling up ſeveral fathoms of the trench&nbsp;before they retired. By that time the breach had&nbsp;been repaired with ſuch new works, that all the efforts&nbsp;to mount it by aſſault proved equally ineffectual and de-ſtructive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unfortunately for the beſieged, the continual fire they had made cauſed ſuch a conſumption of their powder, that they began to feel the want of it; the perfidious d’Amarald, whoſe province it had been to viſit&nbsp;the magazines of it, having amuſed the council with&nbsp;a falſe report, that there was more than ſufficient to&nbsp;maintain the ſiege, though it ſhould laſt a whole twelve-month. But here the grand-maſter found means to&nbsp;ſupply in ſome meaſure that unexpected defect, by the&nbsp;cautious provifion he had made of a large quantity of&nbsp;ſaltpetre, which was immediately ground and made into gunpowder, though he was at the ſame time obliged&nbsp;to order the engineers to be more ſparing of it for the&nbsp;future, and to make uſe of it only in the defence of ſuch&nbsp;breaches as the enemy ſhould make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All this while the Turks had not gained an inch of ground; and the breaches they had made were ſo ſud-denly either repaired or defended by new entrenchments,&nbsp;that the very rubbiſh of them muſt be mounted by aſſault. Solyman, therefore, thought it now adviſable&nbsp;to ſet his numerous pioneers at work, in five different&nbsp;parts, in digging of mines, each of which led to the&nbsp;baſtion oppoſite to it. Some of theſe were countermined by a new invented method of Martinengo; who,&nbsp;by the help of braced ſkins, or drums, could diſcover</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
