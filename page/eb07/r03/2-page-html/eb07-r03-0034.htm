<p><span class="font1">and prepared to support his refusal by force of arms. The terror with which the Tartars had inspired the inhabitants&nbsp;of Russia had now considerably subsided, whilst the hatred&nbsp;which the Russians bore these haughty masters was kept&nbsp;alive by the barbarism of their manners and the difference&nbsp;of their religion. The Christian ministers, justly dreading&nbsp;that the Tartars, in their furious progress, might extirpate&nbsp;Christianity, contributed all in their power to confirm the&nbsp;spirit of revolt amongst the people ; and they promised the&nbsp;crown of martyrdom to such as should fall in battle against&nbsp;the infidels. Thus the contest into which the grand prince&nbsp;determined to enter in support of his authority became in&nbsp;some measure a holy war, undertaken in defence of the&nbsp;national religion. This combination of favourable circumstances operated so strongly in favour of Dimitri, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i</span><span class="font1">ιrinces that had confederated with him, that they soon col-ected an army of two hundred thousand men. With this force the grand prince left Moscow, and marched towards&nbsp;the Don, on the southern bank of which the Tartars were&nbsp;encamped. Arrivcd at this river, he left it to the choice of&nbsp;his troops, either to cross the river and encounter the enemy on the other side, or to await the attack where they were.&nbsp;The general voice declared for passing over to the assault.&nbsp;He accordingly transported his battalions across the river,&nbsp;that he might cut off all hope of escaping by retreat. The&nbsp;fight now commenced, and though the numbers of the enemy&nbsp;far exceeded their own, the Russians defended themselves&nbsp;valiantly against the furious onset of the Tartars ; but as&nbsp;these barbarians were continually relieved by fresh reinforcements, they appeared to be gaining ground. Indeed,&nbsp;nothing but the impossibility of retreating across the river,&nbsp;and the firm persuasion that death would immediately transport them to the mansions of eternal bliss, restrained the&nbsp;Russians from a general flight. At the moment when the&nbsp;day seemed entirely lost, a detachment of the grand prince’s&nbsp;army which had been stationed in reserve, and had remained&nbsp;out of the view of the enemy, came up with unabated force,&nbsp;fell on the rear of the Tartars, and threw them into such&nbsp;terror and confusion that they fled with Mammai at their&nbsp;head, leaving the Russians masters of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This glorious victory, which took place in 1380, was attended with numerous advantages to the Russian cause. In particular, it taught the native princes that the Tartars&nbsp;were not unconquerable ; and that nothing was wanting to&nbsp;relieve them from the galling yoke under which they had&nbsp;long groaned, but mutual union, courage, and prudence.&nbsp;The Tartars appear to have been so much humbled by this&nbsp;defeat, that for a time they left the Russians to enjoy in&nbsp;peace their recovered liberty. This forbearance, however,&nbsp;was not of long duration. Before the death of Dimitri, returning with increased numbers, they laid siege to Moscow,&nbsp;which, after an obstinate defence, was at length induced&nbsp;to surrender, and Russia once more submitted to her old&nbsp;masters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dimitri died in the year 1389, and was succeeded by his son Vasilii Dimitrievitch. In the reign of this prince a new&nbsp;incursion of the Tartars took place, under the great Timur&nbsp;or Tamerlane, who, after having subdued all the neighbouring Tartar hordes, extended his conquests to the Russian&nbsp;territories, took Moscow by assault, and carried off immense&nbsp;plunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The grand principality of Vladimir, or, as it may now be called, of Moscow, had, at the end of the fourteenth century,&nbsp;attained its greatest height, whilst that of Kief had proportionally declined. This latter principality was, at the time&nbsp;of which we are now writing, under the dominion of the&nbsp;Poles, having been seized on in 1320 by Gedemin, duke&nbsp;of Lithuania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The later part of the fifteenth century forms a splendid epoch in the Russian history. At this time, viz. from 1462&nbsp;to 1505, reigned Ivan Vasiliivitch, or, as he is commonly</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">called, John Basilovitz. This able prince, by his invincible spirit and refined policy, became both the conqueror and&nbsp;deliverer of his country, and laid the first foundation of its&nbsp;future grandeur. Observing with indignation the narrow&nbsp;limits of his power at his accession to the throne, after the&nbsp;death of his father Vastlii the Blind, he began immediately&nbsp;to resolve within himself upon the means of enlarging his&nbsp;dominions. He demanded and obtained in marriage Maria,&nbsp;sister of Michael duke of Twer, whom he soon afterwards&nbsp;deposed, on pretence of revehging the injuries done to his&nbsp;father, and added this duchy to his own territories of Moscow. Maria, by whom he had a son, who died before him,&nbsp;did not live long ; and upon her death he married Sophia,&nbsp;daughter of Thomas Palæologus, who had been driven from&nbsp;Constantinople, and forced to seek shelter at Rome, where&nbsp;the pope portioned this princess, in hopes of thus procuring great advantage to the Catholic religion ; but his expectations were frustrated, Sophia being obliged to conform to&nbsp;the Greek church after her arrival in Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Russians certainly owed to this alliance their deliverance from the Tartar yoke. Shocked at the servile homage exacted by these proud victors, when she saw her&nbsp;husband going to meet their ambassadors at some distance&nbsp;from the city, and standing to hear what they had to say,&nbsp;whilst they were at dinner, Sophia told him that she was&nbsp;surprised to find she had married a servant to the Tartars.&nbsp;Nettled at the reproach, Ivan feigned himself ill when the&nbsp;next deputation from the Tartars arrived, and by means of&nbsp;this stratagem avoided a repetition of the humiliating ceremonial. Another circumstance equally displeasing to the&nbsp;princess was, that the Tartars possessed by agreement, within the walls of the palace at Moscow, houses in which their&nbsp;ministers resided ; a stipulation which they had made at once&nbsp;to show their power and watch the actions of the grand&nbsp;prince. To rid her husband and herself of these unpleasant neighbours, Sophia sent a formal embassy to the khan,&nbsp;to inform him, that as she had been favoured with a vision&nbsp;from above, commanding her to build a temple in the place&nbsp;where then stood the houses of the Tartar ministers, her&nbsp;mind could not be at ease till she had fulfilled the divine&nbsp;command; she therefore desired his leave to pull them&nbsp;down, and give his people others. The khan consented.&nbsp;The houses within the Kremlin were demolished, and no&nbsp;new ones being provided, the Tartar residents were obliged to leave Moscow ; an affront which their prince was not&nbsp;able to revenge, as he was then engaged in a war with the&nbsp;Poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ivan, taking advantage of this circumstance, and having gradually increased his forces, now openly disclaimed all&nbsp;subjection to the Tartars, attacked their territories, and&nbsp;made himself master of Kazan. Here he was solemnly&nbsp;crowned with a diadem which is said to be the same that&nbsp;is still used in the coronation of the Russian sovereigns.&nbsp;This took place about the year 1470, and led to a complete&nbsp;emancipation of Russia from the Tartar dominion. Ivan&nbsp;afterwards carried his arms against the neighbouring states.&nbsp;Asiatic Bulgaria, and great part of Lapland, soon submitted to him ; and the great Novgorod, a city then so famous&nbsp;that the Russians were accustomed to intimate their idea&nbsp;of its importance by the proverbial expression, Who can resist God and the great Novgorod ? was reduced by his generals after a seven years’ siege, and yielded immense treasure. After he quitted the city, which had been awed by&nbsp;his presence, the discontents excited at his violent measures broke out into acts of mutiny, upon which he, in 1485,&nbsp;carried off fifty of the principal families, and distributed&nbsp;them through several of the Russian towns. He afterwards removed some thousands of the most considerable&nbsp;inhabitants, and substituted for them more loyal subjects&nbsp;from other places. By these proceedings the flourishing&nbsp;commerce of this city received a considerable shock, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
