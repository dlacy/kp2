<p><span class="font1">The existing species of rhinoceros are naturally grouped into three sections, which some zoologists consider of&nbsp;generic value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinoceros</span><span class="font1"> proper. The adults with a single large compressed incisor above on each side, and occasionally a&nbsp;small lateral one ; below, a very small median, and a&nbsp;very large, procumbent, pointed lateral incisor. Nasal&nbsp;bones pointed in front. A single nasal horn. Skin very&nbsp;thick, and raised into strong, definitely arranged ridges&nbsp;or folds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are two well-marked species of one-horned rhinoceroses. (1) The Indian Rhinoceros, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. uηicomis</span><span class="font1"> of Lin-næus,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> the largest and best known, from being the most frequently exhibited alive in England, is at present only</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">met with in a wild state in the terai region of Nepal and Bhutan, and in the upper valley of the Brahmaputra or&nbsp;province of Assam, though it formerly had a wider range.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Roman shows, was of this species. It was sent from India to Emmanuel, king of Portugal, in 1513 ; and from a sketch&nbsp;of it, taken in Lisbon, Albert Dürer composed his celebrated but rather fanciful engraving, which was reproduced in so many old books on natural history. (2) The&nbsp;Javan Rhinoceros, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. sondaicus,</span><span class="font1"> Cuvier, is distinguished&nbsp;by smaller size, special characters of the teeth and skull,&nbsp;and different arrangement of the plications of the skin (as&nbsp;seen in the figures) ; the horn in the female appears to be&nbsp;very little developed, if not altogether absent. This has&nbsp;a more extensive geographical range, being found in the&nbsp;Bengal Sunderbans near Calcutta, Burmah, the Malay&nbsp;Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, and probably Borneo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ceratorhiηus.</span><span class="font1"> The adults with a moderate-sized&nbsp;compressed incisor above, and a laterally placed, pointed,&nbsp;procumbent incisor below, which is sometimes lost in old&nbsp;animals. Nasal bones narrow and pointed anteriorly. A&nbsp;well-developed nasal, and a small frontal horn separated&nbsp;by an interval. The skin thrown into folds, but these not&nbsp;so strongly marked as in the former section. The smallest&nbsp;living member of the family, the Sumatran Rhiroceros,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. sumatreηsis,</span><span class="font1"> Cuv., belongs to this group. Its geographical range is nearly the same as that of the Javan&nbsp;species, though not extending into Bengal ; but it has&nbsp;been found in Assam, Chittagong, Burmah, the Malay&nbsp;Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. It is possible that&nbsp;more than one species have been confounded under this&nbsp;designation, as two animals now living in the London&nbsp;Zoological Gardens present considerable differences of form&nbsp;and colour. One of them, from Chittagong, has been&nbsp;named by Sclater </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. lasiotis,</span><span class="font1"> the Hairy-Eared Rhinoceros,&nbsp;but until an opportunity is afforded for anatomical examination, it is difficult to pronounce upon the value of&nbsp;the distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atelodus.</span><span class="font1"> In the adults, the incisors are quite rudimentary or entirely wanting. Nasal bones thick, rounded&nbsp;and truncated in front. Well-developed anterior and posterior horns in close contact. Skin without any definite&nbsp;permanent folds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two well-marked existing species are peculiar to the African continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. The common Two-Horned Rhinoceros, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. bicomis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Linn., is the smaller of the two, with a pointed prehensile&nbsp;upper lip, and a narrow compressed deep symphysis of the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">lower jaw. It ranges through the wooded and watered districts of Africa, from Abyssinia in the north to the Cape&nbsp;Colony, but its numbers are yearly diminishing, owing to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> Many authors use Cuvier’s name, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. indicus,</span><span class="font0"> in preference to this, on the ground that there are more than one species with one horn,&nbsp;forgetting that the name substituted is equally inconvenient, as more&nbsp;than one species live in India. The fact of a specific name being&nbsp;applicable to several members of a genus is no objection to its&nbsp;restriction to the first to which it was applied ; otherwise changes in&nbsp;old and well-received names would constantly have to be made in&nbsp;consequence of new discoveries.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
