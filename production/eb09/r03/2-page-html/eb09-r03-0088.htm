        <p><span class="font1">Aurelian in 273 ; in the next year the Gallic empire came to an end
                by the surrender of Tetricus, and the successors&nbsp;of Aurelian—Tacitus, Probus,
                and Carus (275-282)—were&nbsp;at least rulers over the whole extent of the
                empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">While rival generals were contending for the imperial purple, the
                very existence of the empire which they&nbsp;aspired to rule was imperilled by
                foreign invasion. As&nbsp;early as 236 a new enemy, the Alemanni, had crossed
                the&nbsp;Rhine, but had been driven back by the valour of Maxi-minus (238), and in
                the same year the Goths first appeared&nbsp;on the banks of the Danube. It was,
                however, during&nbsp;the period of internal dissension and civil war from
                the&nbsp;reign of Philip (244-249) to the accession of Claudius&nbsp;(268) that the
                barbarians saw and used their opportunity.&nbsp;From across the Rhine bands of
                Alemanni and Franks&nbsp;swept over Gaul and Spain, and even descended upon&nbsp;the
                coasts of Africa, until their raids were checked by&nbsp;the Gallic emperor Postumus
                (253-259). Far more&nbsp;destructive were the raids of the Goths.@@<sup>1</sup>
                Towards the&nbsp;close of the reign of Philip (247) they crossed the
                Danube,&nbsp;and overran Mœsia, Thrace, and Macedonia. In 251&nbsp;they defeated and
                slew the emperor Decius ; and, though&nbsp;his successor Gallus purchased a
                temporary peace by&nbsp;lavish gifts, the province of Dacia was finally lost
                to&nbsp;Rome. The Gothic raids by sea which began under&nbsp;Valerian (253-260) were
                even more destructive. Their&nbsp;fleets issuing from the ports of the Black Sea
                ravaged the&nbsp;seaboard of Asia Minor, and returned laden with the&nbsp;spoils of
                the maritime towns. In the reign of Gallienus&nbsp;(260-268) a fleet of five hundred
                sail appeared off the&nbsp;coasts of Greece itself ; Athens, Corinth, Argos,
                and&nbsp;Sparta were sacked, and Epirus laid waste. On the death&nbsp;of Galfienus
                (268) the Goths once more marched southward, but in the new emperor Claudius they
                were confronted at last by an able and resolute opponent. They&nbsp;were decisively
                defeated and driven back across the&nbsp;Danube (269). Claudius died of the plague
                in the next&nbsp;year, but by his successor Aurelian Roman authority
                was&nbsp;established in Mœsia and Pannonia, and the Danube&nbsp;frontier was put
                once more in a state of efficient defence.&nbsp;Five years later (276) Probus
                repulsed a raid of the&nbsp;Franks and Alemanni, and restored peace on the
                Rhine.&nbsp;But the rule of Rome now stopped short, as in the reign&nbsp;of
                Tiberius, at the line of the two great rivers; all that&nbsp;had been acquired
                beyond since the time of Vespasian&nbsp;was abandoned, and on the further banks of
                the Rhine&nbsp;and Danube stood, in the place of friendly or subject&nbsp;tribes, a
                threatening array of hostile peoples.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At the close of the 2d century the growing weakness of Parthia seemed
                to promise an immunity from danger on&nbsp;the Eastern frontier. But with the
                revolution which&nbsp;jdaced the Sassanidæ upon the throne the whole
                situation&nbsp;was changed.@@<sup>2</sup> The new dynasty was in blood and
                religion&nbsp;Persian ; it claimed descent from Cyrus and Darius, and&nbsp;aspired
                to recover from Western hands the dominions&nbsp;which had once been theirs. In 230
                Artaxares (Ardashir)&nbsp;had formally demanded from Severus Alexander the
                restitution of the provinces of Asia, had invaded Mesopotamia,&nbsp;now a Roman
                province, and even advanced into Syria.&nbsp;Twenty years later his successor Sapor
                again crossed the&nbsp;Euphrates ; in 260, ten years after Decius’s defeat by
                the&nbsp;Goths, the emperor Valerian was conquered and taken&nbsp;prisoner by the
                Persians, who poured triumphantly into&nbsp;Syria and captured Antioch. But here for
                the time their&nbsp;successes ended. Three years later Odsenathus of Palmyra drove
                them back, and held the East securely in the&nbsp;name of Rome. On the fall of
                Zenobia (273) they gained&nbsp;possession for a time of Armenia and Mesopotamia,
                but</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">were driven out by the emperor Carus (282), and the frontier line as
                fixed by Septimius Severus was restored.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms
                of the 3d century had told with fatal effect<sup> </sup>upon the general condition
                of the empire. The “ Roman j&gt;eace ” had vanished ; not only the frontier
                territories, ,&nbsp;but the central districts of Greece, Asia Minor, and even
                :&nbsp;Italy itself, had suffered from the ravages of war, and <sup></sup>the
                fortification of Rome by Aurelian was a significant&nbsp;testimony to the altered
                condition of affairs. War, plague,&nbsp;and famine had thinned the Jiopulation and
                crippled the&nbsp;resources of the provinces. On all sides land was
                running&nbsp;waste, cities and towns were decaying, and commerce was&nbsp;paralysed.
                Only with the greatest difficulty were sufficient funds squeezed from the exhausted
                tax-payers to&nbsp;meet the increasing cost of the defence of the
                frontiers.&nbsp;The old established culture and civilization of the Mediterranean
                world rapidly declined, and the mixture of&nbsp;barbaric rudeness with Oriental
                pomj) and luxury which&nbsp;marked the court, even of the better emperors, such
                as&nbsp;Aurelian, was typical of the general deterioration, which&nbsp;was
                accelerated by the growing practice of settling barbarians on lands within the
                emj)ire, and of admitting&nbsp;them freely to service in the Roman army.</span></p>

                begun by Aurelian and Probus, that of fortifying the empire alike against internal
                sedition and foreign&nbsp;invasion, was completed by Diocletian and
                Constantine&nbsp;the Great, whose system of government, novel as it&nbsp;appears at
                first sight, was in reality the natural and&nbsp;inevitable outcome of the history
                of the previous century.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Its object was twofold, to give
                increased stability to the&nbsp;imperial authority itself, and to organize an
                efficient&nbsp;administrative machinery throughout the empire. In the&nbsp;second
                year of his reign Diocletian associated Maximian&nbsp;with himself as colleague, and
                six years later (292) the&nbsp;hands of the two “ Augusti ” were further
                strengthened&nbsp;by the proclamation of Constantius and Galerius as&nbsp;“
                Caesares.” Precedents for such an arrangement might&nbsp;have been quoted from the
                earlier history of the empire ;@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>and the considerations in favour
                of it at the time were&nbsp;strong. It divided the overwhelming burdens and
                responsibilities of government, without sacrificing the unity of&nbsp;the empire ;
                for, although to each of the Augusti and&nbsp;Cæsars a separate sphere was assigned,
                the Cæsars were&nbsp;subordinate to the higher authority of the Augusti,
                and&nbsp;over all his three colleagues Diocletian claimed to exercise&nbsp;a
                paramount control. It at least reduced the too familiar&nbsp;risk of a disputed
                succession by establishing in the two&nbsp;Cæsars the natural successors to the
                higher position of&nbsp;Augusti, and finally it satisfied the jealous pride of
                the&nbsp;rival armies of the empire by giving them what they had&nbsp;so constantly
                claimed, imperatores of their own. The distribution of power between Diocletian and
                his colleagues&nbsp;followed those lines of division which the feuds of
                the&nbsp;previous century had only too clearly marked out. The&nbsp;armies of the
                Rhine, the Danube, and of Syria fell to the&nbsp;lot respectively of Constantius,
                Galerius, and Diocletian,&nbsp;the central districts of Italy and Africa to
                    Maximian.@@<sup>5</sup> A</span></p>
