<p><span class="font0">vast natural resources of the country, public instruction received an unprecedented impetus, a considerable amount of liberty was&nbsp;accorded to the press, a strong spirit of liberalism pervaded&nbsp;rapidly all sections of the educated classes, a new imaginative&nbsp;and critical literature dealing with economic, philosophical and&nbsp;political questions sprang into existence, and for a time the young&nbsp;generation fondly imagined that Russia, awakening from her traditional lethargy, was about to overtake, and soon to surpass, on the&nbsp;path of national progress, the older nations of western Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These sanguine expectations were not fully realized. The economic and moral condition of the peasantry was little&nbsp;improved by freedom, and in many districts there were signs&nbsp;of positive impoverishment and demoralization. The local&nbsp;self-government institutions after a short period of feverish&nbsp;and not always well-directed activity, showed symptoms of&nbsp;organic exhaustion. The reformed tribunals, though incomparably better than their predecessors, did not give universal&nbsp;satisfaction. In the imperial administration, the corruption&nbsp;and long-established abuses which had momentarily vanished,&nbsp;began to reappear. Industrial enterprises did not always succeed.&nbsp;Education produced many unforeseen and undesirable practical&nbsp;results. The liberty of the press not unfrequently degenerated&nbsp;into licence, and sane liberalism was often replaced by socialistic&nbsp;dreaming. In short, it became only too evident that there was&nbsp;no royal road to national prosperity, and that Russia, like other&nbsp;nations, must be content to advance slowly and laboriously&nbsp;along the rough path of painful experience. In these circumstances sanguine enthusiasm naturally gave way to despondency,&nbsp;and the reforming zeal of the government was replaced by tendencies of a decidedly reactionary kind. Partly from disappointment and nervous exhaustion, and partly from a conviction that&nbsp;the country required rest in order to judge the practical results&nbsp;of the reforms already accomplished, the tsar refrained from&nbsp;further initiating new legislation, and the government gave it to&nbsp;be understood that the epoch of the great reforms was closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the younger ranks of the educated classes this state of things produced keen dissatisfaction, which soon found vent&nbsp;in revolutionary agitation. At first the agitation&nbsp;was of an academic character and was dealt with by&nbsp;the press-censure; but it gradually took the form of&nbsp;secret associations, and the police had to interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were no great, well-organized secret societies, but there were many small groups, composed chiefly of male and female&nbsp;students of the universities and technical schools, which worked&nbsp;independently for a common purpose. Finding that the walls&nbsp;of autocracy could not be overturned by blasts of revolutionary&nbsp;trumpets in the periodical press and in clandestinely printed&nbsp;seditious proclamations, the young enthusiasts determined to&nbsp;seek the support of the masses, or, as they termed it, <sup>u</sup> to go&nbsp;in among the people </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">” (idti v nardd).</span><span class="font0"> Under the disguise of&nbsp;doctors, mid wives, school teachers, governesses, factory hands&nbsp;or common labourers, they sought to make proselytes among&nbsp;the peasantry and the workmen in the industrial centres by&nbsp;revolutionary pamphlets and oral explanations. For a time&nbsp;the propaganda had very little success, because the uneducated peasants and factory workers could not understand the&nbsp;phraseology and abstract principles of socialism; but when the&nbsp;propagandists descended to a lower platform and spread rumours&nbsp;that the tsar had given all the land to the peasants, and was&nbsp;prevented by the proprietors and officials from carrying out&nbsp;his benevolent intentions, there was a serious danger of agrarian&nbsp;disorders, and energetic measures were adopted by the authorities. Wholesale arrests were made by the police, and many&nbsp;of the accused were imprisoned or exiled to distant provinces,&nbsp;some by the regular tribunals, and others by so-called “ administrative procedure ” without a formal trial. The activity of&nbsp;the police and the sufferings of the victims naturally produced&nbsp;intense excitement and bitterness among those who escaped&nbsp;arrest, and a secret organization calling itself the Executive&nbsp;Committee announced in its clandestinely printed organs that&nbsp;the functionaries who distinguished themselves in the suppression of the propaganda would be “ removed.” A number&nbsp;of prominent officials were accordingly condemned to death&nbsp;by this secret terrorist tribunal, and in some cases the sentences&nbsp;were carried out. General Mezentsov, the head of the political&nbsp;police, was assassinated in broad daylight in one of the principal&nbsp;streets of St Petersburg, and in the provinces a good many&nbsp;officials of various grades shared the same fate. As these acts&nbsp;of terrorism had quite the opposite of the desired effect, repeated attempts were made on the life of the emperor, and at&nbsp;last the carefully laid plans of the conspirators were successful.&nbsp;On the 13th of March 1881, when returning from a military&nbsp;parade to the Winter Palace, Alexander II. was terribly wounded&nbsp;by the explosion of a bomb, and died shortly afterwards. (For&nbsp;details of this revolutionary movement, see Nihilism.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In respect of foreign policy the reign of Alexander II. differed widely from that of Nicholas. The Eastern Colossus no longer&nbsp;inspired respect and fear in Europe. Until the country&nbsp;had completely recovered from the exhaustion of the&nbsp;Crimean War the government remained in the background of European polities. Its attitude was graphically&nbsp;described in the famous declaration of Prince Gorchakov:&nbsp;“ La Russie ne boude pas; elle se recueille.” On one point,&nbsp;however, this description was not accurate; Russia sulked&nbsp;so far as Austria was concerned, for she could not forget that&nbsp;the emperor Francis Joseph, by his wavering and unfriendly&nbsp;conduct towards her during the Crimean War, had ill repaid her&nbsp;assistance to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1849, and had fulfilled&nbsp;the cynical prediction of Prince Schwarzenberg that his country&nbsp;would astonish the world by her ingratitude. It was not&nbsp;without secret satisfaction, therefore, that Prince Gorchakov&nbsp;watched the repeated defeats of the Austrian army in the&nbsp;Italian campaign of 1859, and he felt inclined to respond to the&nbsp;advances made to him by Napoleon III.; but the germs of a&nbsp;Russo-French alliance, which had come into existence immediately after the Crimean War, ripened very slowly, and they were&nbsp;completely destroyed in 1863 when the French emperor wounded&nbsp;Russian sensibilities deeply by giving moral and diplomatic&nbsp;support to the Polish insurrection. On that occasion Bismarck&nbsp;helped Gorchakov to ward off the threatened intervention of&nbsp;France and England, and he thereby founded the cordial&nbsp;relations which subsisted between the cabinets of Berlin and&nbsp;St Petersburg down to 1878, and which contributed powerfully&nbsp;to the creation of the German empire by defending the Prussian&nbsp;cabinet against the jealousy and enmity of Austria and France.&nbsp;In return for these services Bismarck helped Russia to recover&nbsp;a portion of what she had lost by the Crimean War, for it was&nbsp;thanks to his connivance and diplomatic support that she was&nbsp;able in 1871 to denounce with impunity the clauses of the&nbsp;treaty of Paris which limited Russian armament in the Black&nbsp;Sea. Had the tsar been satisfied with this important success,&nbsp;which enabled him to rebuild Sevastopol and construct a Black&nbsp;Sea fleet, his reign might have been a peaceful and prosperous&nbsp;one, but he tried to recover the remainder of what&nbsp;had been lost by the Crimean War, the province of&nbsp;Bessarabia and predominant influence in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To effect this, he embarked on the Turkish War of 1877-78, which ’ended in disappointment Though the campaign enabled him to recover Bessarabia at the expense of his&nbsp;Rumanian ally, it did not increase Russian prestige in the East,&nbsp;because the Russian army was repeatedly repulsed by the&nbsp;Turks, and when at last it reached Constantinople, it was prevented from entering the city by the threatening attitude of&nbsp;England and Austria. In the field of diplomacy there was likewise disappointment. The concessions extorted from the Porte&nbsp;in the preliminary treaty of San Stefano (March 3, 1878) were&nbsp;revived and considerably modified in favour of Turkey by the&nbsp;congress of Berlin (June 13-July 13,1878); see Europe: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much greater success attended the efforts of Russian diplomacy and Russian arms in Asia. By the treaty of Aigun (May 28,&nbsp;1858), and without any military operations, the&nbsp;cession of a great part of the basin of the Amur was&nbsp;obtained from China. Six years later began the&nbsp;rapid expansion of Russia in Central Asia, and at the end</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
