or <hi rend="smallcaps">Public Funds</hi> <hi rend="italic">in England.</hi> By the word sto <hi rend="italic">ck</hi> was originally meant a particular ſum of money contributed to the eſtabliſhing of a fund to enable a company to carry on a certain trade, by means of which the person became a partner in that trade, and received a ſhare of the profit made thereby, in proportion to the money employed. But this term has been extended farther, though improperly, to signify any ſum of money which has been lent to the government, on condition of receiving a certain intereſt till the money is repaid, and which makes a part of the national debt. As the ſecurity both of the government and of the public companies is eſteemed preferable to that of any private perſon, as the stocks are negotiable and may be sold at any time, and as the intereſt is always punctually paid when due ; ſo they are thereby enabled to borrow money on a lower intereſt than what could be obtained from lending it to private persons, where there muſt be always ſome danger of losing both principal and interest.</p><p>But as every capital stock or fund of a company is raised for a particular purpoſe, and limited by parliament to a certain ſum, it neceſſarily follows, that when, that fund is completed, no stock can be bought of the company ; though ſhares already purchaſed may be transferred from one perſon to another. This being the caſe, there is frequently a great diſproportion between the original value of the ſhares and what is given for them when transferred : for if there are more buyers than sellers, a perſon who is indifferent about selling will not part with his ſhare without a conſiderable profit to himſelf; and on the contrary, if many are diſpoſed to sell, and few inclined to buy, the value of such ſhares will naturally fall in proportion to the impatience of thoſe who want to turn their stock into ſpecie.</p><p>A stock may likewiſe be affected by the court of chancery ; for if that court ſhould order the money, which is under their direction, to be laid out in any particular stock, that stock, by having more purchasers, will be raised to a higher price than any other of the like value.</p><p>By what has been ſaid, the reader will perceive how much the credit and interest of the nation depends on the ſupport of the public funds. While the annuities and intereſt for money advanced is there regularly paid, and the principal insured by both prince and people (a ſecurity not to be had in other nations), foreigners will lend us their property, and all Europe be interested in our welfare ; the paper of the companies will be converted into money and merchandiſe, and Great Britain can never want caſh to carry her ſchemes into execution.
