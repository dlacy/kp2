            <p>tians for the worship and service of God, their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, a
                little consideration will easily discover how it ought to be observed. Although a
                day separated from worldly business, yet it is in no sense a day of idleness, but a
                season appropriated to the works of salvation and labours of charity.</p>
            <p>In the primitive times this holy day was observed in the most solemn manner. From the
                monuments of those early ages we learn, that it was spent in a due and constant
                attendance on all the offices of divine worship. On it they held their religious
                assemblies, in which the writings of the apostles and prophets were read to the
                people, and the doctrines of Christianity further pressed upon them by the
                exhortations of the clergy. Solemn prayers and praises were offered up to God, and
                hymns sung in honour of Christ ; the Lord’s supper was constantly celebrated ; and
                collections were made for the maintenance of the clergy and the relief of the poor.
                On this day they abstained as much as they could from bodily labour. They looked
                upon it as a day of joy and gladness ; and therefore all fasting on it was
                prohibited, even during the season of Lent, their great annual fast. Such was the
                zeal of those times, that nothing, no not the severest persecutions, hindered them
                from celebrating the holy offices on this day. They were often beset and betrayed,
                and as often slaughtered in consequence of cruel edicts from emperors, those very
                emperors for whose happiness and prosperity they always offered up their fervent
                prayers. For this cause, when they could not meet in the day-time, they assembled in
                the morning before it was light ; and when sick, in exile, or in prison, nothing
                troubled them more than that they could not attend the service of the church. No
                trivial pretences were then admitted for any one’s absence from public worship ; for
                severe censures were passed upon all who were absent without some urgent necessity.
                When the empire became Christian, Constantine and his successors made laws for the
                more solemn observa- tion of the Lord’s day. They prohibited all prosecutions and
                pleadings, and other juridical matters, to be transacted on it, and also all
                unnecessary labour; not that it was looked upon as a Jewish sabbath, but because
                these things were considered as inconsistent with the duties of the festival.</p>
            <p>But although the primitive Christians did not indulge themselves in the practice of
                unnecessary labour or trifling amusements, yet they did not wholly abstain from
                working, if great necessity required it. The council of Laodicea enjoined that men
                should abstain from work on the Lord’s day if possible ; but if any were found to
                Judaize, they were to be censured as great transgressors. So circumspect were the
                primitive Christians about their conduct on this festival, that on the one hand they
                avoided all things which tended to profane it, whilst on the other they censured all
                those who insisted that it should be observed with Pharisaical rigour and
                devotion.</p>
            <p>The. primary duty of the Lord’s day is public worship. The nature and design of the
                Christian religion sufficiently shows the necessity and importance of assembling for
                the duties of devotion. The whole scope of Christianity is to bring us to an union
                with God, which cannot be obtained or preserved without frequent communications with
                him ; and the reasons which show religious intercourse to be the indispensable duty
                of Christians in a private capacity, will bind it with equal or more force on them
                considered as a community.</p>
            <p>The advantages of public worship, when duly performed, are many and great. There are
                two, however, which deserve to be considered in a particular manner. It gives
                Christians an opportunity of openly professing their faith, and testifying their
                obedience to their Redeemer in the wisest and best manner ; and in an age when
                infidelity has arisen to an alarming height, when the Son of God is crucified
                afresh, and put to open shame, every man, who has</p>
            <p>any regard for religion, will cheerfully embrace all opportunities of declaring his
                abhorrence of the vicious courses pursued by those apostates. He will lay hold with
                pleasure on every occasion to testify that he is neither afraid nor ashamed to
                confess the truth ; and will think it his indispensable duty openly to disavow the
                sins of others, that he may not incur the guilt of partaking of them.</p>
            <p>Public worship preserves in the minds of men a sense of religion, without which
                society cannot exist. Nothing can keep a body of men together, and unite them in
                promoting the public good, but such principles of action as may reach and govern the
                heart. But these can be derived only from a sense of religious duties, which can
                never be so strongly impressed upon the mind as by a constant attendance upon public
                worship. Nothing can be more weak than to neglect the public worship of God, under
                the pretence that we can employ ourselves as acceptably to our Maker at home in our
                closets. Both kinds of worship are indeed necessary ; but one debt cannot be paid by
                the discharge of another. By public worship every man professes his belief in that
                God whom he adores, and appeals to Him for his sincerity, of which his neighbour
                cannot judge. By this appeal he endears himself more or less to others. It creates
                confidence ; and it roots in the heart benevolence, and all other Christian virtues,
                which produce, in common life, the fruits of mutual love and general peace.</p>

                profanation of the Lord’s day, is punishable by law. For besides the notorious
                indecency and scandal of permitting any secular business to be publicly transacted
                on that day, in a country professing Christianity, and the corruption of morals
                which usually follows its profanation, the keeping one day in seven holy, as a time
                of relaxation and refreshment, as well as for public worship, is of admirable
                service to a state, considered merely as a civil institution. It humanizes, by the
                help of conversation and society, the manners of the lower classes, which would
                otherwise degenerate into a sordid ferocity and selfishness of spirit ; it enables
                the industrious workman to pursue his occupation in the ensuing week with health and
                cheerfulness ; it imprints on the minds of the people that sense of their duty to
                God which is so necessary to make them good citizens, but which yet would be worn
                out and defaced by an unremitted continuance of labour, without any stated times of
                recalling them to the worship of their Maker.</p>

            <p>SABELLIANS, a sect of Christians of the third century’, that embraced the opinions of
                Sabellius, a philosopher of Egypt, who openly taught that there is but one person in
                the Godhead. The Sabellians maintained, that the Word and the Holy Spirit are only
                virtues, emanations, or functions of the Deity, and held, that he who is in heaven
                is the Father of all things ; that he descended into the virgin, became a child, and
                was born of her as a son ; and that having accomplished the mystery of our
                salvation, he diffused himself on the apostles in tongues of fire, and was then
                denominated the Holy Ghost. This they explained by comparing God to the sun, the
                illuminative virtue or quality of which was the Word, and its warming virtue the
                Holy Spirit. The Word, they taught, was darted, like a divine ray, to accomplish the
                work of redemption ; and that being re-ascended to heaven, the influences of the
                Father were communicated after a like manner to the apostles.</p>
