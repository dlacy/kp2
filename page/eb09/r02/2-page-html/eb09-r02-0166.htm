<p><span class="font2">Amar and Vadier; they were certain of obtaining a majority in the convention, for they knew that the chief&nbsp;deputies on the left or the Mountain were Dantonists, who&nbsp;burned to avenge Danton’s death ; while they felt sure also&nbsp;that the mass of the deputies of the centre or the Marsh&nbsp;could be hounded on against Robespierre if they were to&nbsp;accuse him of aiming at the dictatorship and pour on him&nbsp;the obloquy of having increased the Terror ; and they&nbsp;knew finally that his actual adherents, though devoted to&nbsp;him, were few in number. The devotion of these admirers&nbsp;had been further excited by the news that a half-witted&nbsp;girl, named Cécile Renault, had been found wandering&nbsp;near his house, with a knife in her possession, intending&nbsp;to play the part of Charlotte Corday. She was executed&nbsp;on the 17 th of June, on the very day that Vadier raised&nbsp;a laugh at Robespierre’s expense in the convention by his&nbsp;report on the conspiracy of Catherine Théot, a mad woman,&nbsp;who had asserted that Robespierre was a divinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For a statesman to be laughed at in France is fatal to his power, and Robespierre himself felt that he must strike&nbsp;his blow now or never. Yet he was not sufficiently&nbsp;audacious to strike at once, as Payan and Coffinhal, the&nbsp;ablest of his adherents, would have had him do, but retired from the convention for some weeks, as he had done&nbsp;before the overthrow of the Hébertists and the Dantonists,&nbsp;to prepare his plan of action. This retirement seemed&nbsp;ominous to the majority of the great committee, and they&nbsp;too prepared for the struggle by communicating with the&nbsp;deputies of the Mountain, who were either friends of&nbsp;Danton or men of proved energy like Barras, Frèron, and&nbsp;Tallien. These weeks, the last of his life, Robespierre&nbsp;passed very peacefully, according to his wont all through&nbsp;the Revolution. He continued to live with the Duplays,&nbsp;with whose daughter Éléonore he had fallen in love, and&nbsp;used to wander with her and his favourite dog, a great&nbsp;Danish hound, named Bruant, in the Champs Élysées&nbsp;during the long summer evenings. At last, on the 26th of&nbsp;July, Robespierre appeared for the first time for more than&nbsp;four weeks in the convention and delivered a carefully&nbsp;studied harangue, which lasted for more than four hours,&nbsp;in which he declared that the Terror ought to be ended,&nbsp;that certain deputies who had acted unjustly and exceeded&nbsp;their powers ought to be punished, and that the committees&nbsp;of public safety and general security ought to be renewed.&nbsp;Great was the excitement in the convention : all wondered&nbsp;who were the deputies destined to be punished ; all were&nbsp;surprised that the Terror should be imputed as a fault to&nbsp;the very committee of which Robespierre had been a&nbsp;member. The majority of the great committee determined&nbsp;to act promptly. The convention, moved by Robespierre’s&nbsp;eloquence, at first passed his motions ; but he was replied&nbsp;to by Cambon the financier, Billaud-Varenne, Amar, and&nbsp;Vadier, and the convention rescinded their decrees and&nbsp;referred Robespierre’s question to their committees. On&nbsp;the following day, the 27th of July, or in the revolutionary calendar the 9th Thermidor, Saint-Just commenced&nbsp;to speak on behalf of the motions of Robespierre, when&nbsp;violent interruptions showed the temper of the convention. Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, and Vadier again attacked&nbsp;Robespierre ; cries of “ Down with the tyrant ! ” were&nbsp;raised ; and; when Robespierre hesitated in his speech in&nbsp;answer to these attacks, the words “ C’est le sang de Danton qui t’étouffe ” showed what was uppermost in the&nbsp;minds of the Mountain. The excitement increased, and&nbsp;at five in the afternoon Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just, with two young deputies, Augustin Robespierre and&nbsp;Lebas, the only men in all the convention who supported&nbsp;them, were ordered to be arrested. Yet all hope for Robespierre was not gone ; he was speedily rescued from his&nbsp;prison with the other deputies by the troops of the commune and brought to the Hôtel de Ville. There he was&nbsp;surrounded by his faithful adherents, led by Payan and&nbsp;Coffinhal, but the day was past when the commune could&nbsp;overawe the convention ; for now the men of action were&nbsp;hostile to the commune, and its chief was not a master of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coups dieted.</span><span class="font2"> On the news of the release of Robespierre,&nbsp;the convention had again met, and declared the members&nbsp;of the commune and the released deputies </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hors de la loi.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The national guards under the command of Barras had&nbsp;little difficulty in making their way to the Hôtel de Ville ;&nbsp;Robespierre was shot in the lower jaw by a young gendarme named Merda while signing an appeal to one of the&nbsp;sections of Paris to take up arms for him, though the&nbsp;wound was afterwards believed to have been inflicted by&nbsp;himself ; and all the released deputies were again arrested.&nbsp;After a night of agony Robespierre was the next day&nbsp;taken before the tribunal, where his identity as an outlaw&nbsp;was proved, and without further trial he was executed&nbsp;with Couthon and Saint-Just and nineteen others of his&nbsp;adherents on the Place de la Révolution on the lθth Thermidor (28th July) 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The character of Robespierre when looked upon simply in the light of his actions and his authenticated speeches, and apart from&nbsp;the innumerable legends which have grown up about it, is not a&nbsp;difficult one to understand. A well-educated and accomplished&nbsp;young lawyer, he might have acquired a good provincial practice&nbsp;and lived a happy provincial life had it not been for the Revolution.&nbsp;Like thousands of other young Frenchmen, he had read the works&nbsp;of Rousseau and taken them as gospel. Just at the very time in&nbsp;life when this illusion had not been destroyed by the realities of&nbsp;life, and without the experience which might have taught the&nbsp;futility of idle dreams and theories, he was elected to the states-general. At Paris he was not understood till he met with his&nbsp;audience of fellow-disciples of Rousseau at the Jacobin Club. His&nbsp;fanaticism won him supporters ; his singularly sweet and sympathetic voice gained him hearers ; and his upright life attracted the&nbsp;admiration of all. As matters approached nearer and nearer to&nbsp;the terrible crisis, he failed, except in the two instances of the&nbsp;question of war and of the king’s trial, to show himself a statesman, for he had not the liberal views and practical instincts which&nbsp;made Mirabeau and Danton great men. His admission to the&nbsp;great committee gave him power, which he hoped to use for the&nbsp;establishment of his favourite theories, and for the same purpose&nbsp;he acquiesced in and even heightened the horrors of the Reign of&nbsp;Terror. It is here that the fatal mistake of allowing a theorist to&nbsp;have power appeared: Billaud-Varenne systematized the Terror&nbsp;because he believed it necessary for the safety of the country ;&nbsp;Robespierre intensified it in order to carry out his own ideas and&nbsp;theories. Robespierre’s private life was always respectable : he&nbsp;was always emphatically a gentleman and man of culture, and even&nbsp;a little bit of a dandy, scrupulously honest, truthful, and charitable. In his habits and manner of life he was simple and laborious ; he was not a man gifted with flashes of genius, but one who&nbsp;had to think much before he could come to a decision, and he&nbsp;worked hard all his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great authority for Robespierre’s life is Ernest Hamel’s elaborate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vie de Robespierre,</span><span class="font0"> 3 vols., Paris, 1865-67, in which every fact regarding him is carefully sifted ; it is indeed an unqualified defence and eulogy throughout, but,&nbsp;without adopting his particular views, Hamel’s biography is the only one of&nbsp;any value.
