in muſic, the naming or pronouncing the ſeveral notes of a ſong by the ſyllables ut, re, mi, fa, ſol, &amp; c. in learning to sing it.</p><p>Of the ſeven notes in the French ſcale ut, re, mi, fa, ſol, la, si, only four are uſed among us in ſinging, as<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0606.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0600"/>
<hi rend="italic">mi, fa, sol, la:</hi> their office is principally, in ſinging, that by applying them to every note of the ſcale, it may not only be pronounced with more ease, but chiefly that by them the tones and ſemitones of the natural ſcale may be better marked out and diſtinguished. This design is obtained by the four ſyllables fa, s <hi rend="italic">ol, la, mi.</hi> Thus from <hi rend="italic">fa</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ſol</hi> is a tone, allo from <hi rend="italic">ſol</hi> to <hi rend="italic">la,</hi> and from <hi rend="italic">la</hi> to <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> without diſtinguiſhing the greater or leſs tone ; but from <hi rend="italic">la</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fa,</hi> also from <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> to f <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is only a semitone. If then theſe be applied in this order, fa, sol, <hi rend="italic">la, fa,ſol, la, mi, ſa.</hi> &amp; c. they expreſs the natural series from C ; and if that be repeated to a second or third octave, we ſee by them how to expreſs all the different orders of tones and ſemitones in the diatonic scale ; and ſtill above <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> will ſtand f <hi rend="italic">a, ſol, la,</hi> and below it the ſame inverted <hi rend="italic">la, ſol, fa,</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> is always diſtant from another an octave ; which cannot be ſaid of any of the rest, becauſe after <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> aſcending come always f <hi rend="italic">a, ſol, la,</hi> which ate repeated invertedly deſcending.</p><p>To conceive the uſe of this, it is to be remembered, that the firſt thing in learning to sing, is to make one raiſe a ſcale of notes by tones and ſemitones to an octave, and deſcend again by the lame ; and then to riſe and fall by greater intervals at a leap, as thirds and fourths, &amp; c. and to do all this by beginning at notes of different pitch. Then thoſe notes are repreſented by lines and ſpaces, to which theſe ſyllables are applied, and the learners taught to name each line and ſpace thereby, which makes what we call <hi rend="italic">ſolfaing ;</hi> the uſe whereof is, that while they are learning to tune the degrees and intervals of ſound expreſſed by notes on a line or ſpace, or learning a ſong to which no words are applied, they may not only do it the better by means of articulate sounds, but chiefly that by knowing the degrees and intervals expreſſed by thoſe ſyllables, they may more readily know the places of the semitones, and the true diſtance of the notes.
