<p><span class="font1">The camp of Batu was first reached near the northernmost point of his summer marches, therefore about Ukek or Uvyek,&nbsp;near Saratov (see Marco Polo, Paris ed. of 1824, p. 3). Before&nbsp;the camp was left they had marched with it five weeks down&nbsp;the Volga. The point of departure would lie on that river&nbsp;somewhere between 48° and 50° N. The route taken lay E.&nbsp;by a line running N. of the Caspian and Aral basins; then&nbsp;from about 70° E. to the basin of the Talas river; thence&nbsp;across the passes of the Kirghiz Ala-tau and S. of the Balkash&nbsp;Lake to the Ala-kul and the Baratula Lake (Ebi-nor). From&nbsp;this the travellers struck N. across the Barluk, or the Orkochuk&nbsp;Mountains, and thence, passing S. of the modem Kobdo, to&nbsp;the valley of the Jabkan river, whence they emerged on the&nbsp;plain of Mongolia, coming upon the Great Khan’s camp at a&nbsp;spot ten days’ journey from Karakorum and bearing in the&nbsp;main S. from that place, with the Khangai Mountains between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This route is of course not thus defined in the narrative, but is a deduction from the facts stated therein. The key to&nbsp;the whole is the description given of that central portion intervening between the basin of the Talas and Lake Ala-kul, which&nbsp;enables the topography of that region, including the passage&nbsp;of the Hi, the plain S. of the Balkash, and the Ala-kul itself,&nbsp;to be identified past question.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The return journey, being made in summer, after retraversing the Jabkan valley,@@<sup>2</sup> lay apparently farther to the N., and passed N. of the Balkash, probably with a fairly straight course,&nbsp;to the mouths of the Volga. Thence the party travelled S.&nbsp;by Derbent, and so by Shamakhi to the Araxes, Nakhshivan,&nbsp;Erzingan, Sivas and Iconium, to Lajazzo, Layas, or Ayas,&nbsp;where they embarked for Cyprus and Syria. St Louis had&nbsp;returned to France a year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have alluded to Roger Bacon’s mention of Friar William. Indeed, in the geographical section of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Majus (c.</span><span class="font0"> 1262)&nbsp;he cites the traveller repeatedly and copiously, describing him as&nbsp;“ frater Wilhelmus quern dominus rex Franciae misit ad Tartaros,&nbsp;Anno Domini 1253 . .. qui perlustravit regiones orientiset aquilonis&nbsp;et loca in medio his annexa, et scripsit haec praedicta illustri regi;&nbsp;quern librum diligenter vidi et cum ejus auctore contuli ” (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opus&nbsp;Majus,</span><span class="font0"> Oxford edition of 1897, i. 353-66). Add to this William’s&nbsp;own incidental particulars as to his being—like his precursor,&nbsp;Friar John de Plano Carpini—a very heavy man </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ponderosus valde),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and we know no more of his personality, except the abundant&nbsp;indications of character afforded by the story itself. These paint&nbsp;for us an honest, pious, stout-hearted, acute and most intelligent&nbsp;observer, keen in tne acquisition ofknowledge, the author of one of&nbsp;the best narratives of travel in existence. His language indeed is&nbsp;dog-Latin of the most un-Ciceronian quality; but it is in his hands&nbsp;a pithy and transparent medium of expression. In spite of all the&nbsp;difficulties of communication, and of the badness of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">turgemannus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or dragoman,@@<sup>3</sup> he gathered a mass of particulars, wonderfully true&nbsp;or near the truth, not only as to Asiatic nature, geography, ethnography and manners, but as to religion and language. Of his&nbsp;geography a good example occurs in his account of the Caspian&nbsp;(eagerly caught up by Roger Bacon), which is perfectly accurate,&nbsp;except that he places the hill country occupied by the Mulahids, or&nbsp;Assassins, on the E. instead of the S. shore. He explicitly corrects&nbsp;the allegation of Isidore that it is a gulf of the ocean: “ non est&nbsp;verum quod dicit Ysidorus . . . nusquam enim tangit oceanum,&nbsp;sed undique circumdatur terra ” (265).@@<sup>4 </sup>Of his interest and acumen&nbsp;in matters of language we may cite examples. The language of the&nbsp;Pascatir (or Bashkirs) and of the Hungarians is the same as he had</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">learned from Dominicans who had been among them (274).@@<sup>5 </sup>The language of the Ruthenians, Poles, Bohemians and Slavonians is&nbsp;one, and is the^ same with that of the Vandals, or Wends (275).&nbsp;In the town of Equius (immediately beyond the lli, perhaps Aspara)@@<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;the people were .Mahommedans speaking Persian, though so far&nbsp;remote from Persia (281). The Uighurs (or Yugurs) of the country&nbsp;about Cailac (see note above) had formed a language and character&nbsp;of their own, and in that language and character the Nes-torians of that tract used to perform their office and write their&nbsp;books (281-82). The Uighurs are those'among whom are found&nbsp;the fountain and root of the Turkish and Comanian tongue (289).&nbsp;Their character has been adopted by the Mongols. In using it they&nbsp;begin writing from the top and write downwards, whilst line follows&nbsp;line from left to right (286). The Nestorians say their service, and&nbsp;have their holy books, in Syriac, but know nothing of the language,&nbsp;just as some of our monks sing the mass without knowing Latin (293).&nbsp;The Tibet people write as we do, and their letters have a strong&nbsp;resemblance to ours. The Tangut people write from right to left&nbsp;like the Arabs, and their lines advance upwards (329). The current&nbsp;money of Cathay is of cotton paper, a palm in length and breadth,&nbsp;and on this they print lines like those of Mangu Khan’s seal:—&nbsp;“ imprimunt lineas sicut est sigillum Mangu •— a remarkable&nbsp;expression. They write with a painter’s pencil and combine in one&nbsp;character several letters, forming one expression:—“ faciunt in una&nbsp;figura plures literas comprehendentes unam dictionem,”—a still&nbsp;more remarkable utterance, showing an approximate apprehension of&nbsp;the nature of Chinese writing (329).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yet this sagacious observer is denounced as an untruthful blunderer by Isaac Jacob Schmidt (a man of useful learning, of&nbsp;a kind rare in his day, but narrow, wrong-headed, and in natural&nbsp;acumen and candour far inferior to the 13th-century friar) simply&nbsp;because Rubrouck’s evidence as to the Turkish dialect of the Uighurs&nbsp;traversed a pet heresy, long since exploded, which Schmidt entertained, viz. that the Uighurs were by race and language Tibetan.@@<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Léon Cahun </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Introduction à ¡'histoire de l'Asie,</span><span class="font0"> pp. 353-55, 384-86,&nbsp;392) also shows a strange perversity in depreciating Rubrouck;&nbsp;all this detraction may be contrasted with Oscar Peschel’s admirably&nbsp;fair judgment </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Geschichte der Erdkunde,</span><span class="font0"> p. 165, &amp;c.). At the same&nbsp;time, Rubrouck may be considered inferior as a politician and&nbsp;diplomatist to Carpini ; and the latter’s remarkable work has in its&nbsp;turn suffered from undiscriminating eulogy of his successor’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iiinerarium.</span><span class="font0"> An attempt has been made to strike a balance in the&nbsp;judgment t&gt;f these two great pioneers in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dawn of Modern&nbsp;Geography,</span><span class="font0"> ik 375-81.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The narrative of Rubrouck, after Roger Bacon’s copious use of it, seems to have dropped out of sight, though five MSS. are still known&nbsp;to exist: the chief of these are (1) Corp. Chr. Coll., Cambridge, No.&nbsp;66, fols. 67 v.-no v. of about 1320; (2) No. 181 of the same&nbsp;library, fols. 321-98, of about 1270-90; (3) Leiden Univ. Libr., No.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">77 </span><span class="font0">(formerly 104), fols<sub>;</sub> 160 n-190 r. of about 1290. It has no place&nbsp;in the famous collections of the 14th century, nor in the earlier&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Historiale</span><span class="font0"> of Vincent of Beauvais, which gives so much&nbsp;attention to the 13th-century intercourse of Latin Christendom&nbsp;with Tartary. It first appeared imperfectly in Hakluyt (1598 and&nbsp;1599)» ns we have mentioned. But it was not till 1839 that any&nbsp;proper edition of the text was published. In that year the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil&nbsp;, de Voyages^</span><span class="font0"> the Paris Geographical Society, vol. iv., contained an&nbsp;edition of the Latin text, and a collation of the MSS. put forth by&nbsp;M. d’Avezac, with the.assistance of two young scholars, since of high&nbsp;distinction, viz. Francisque Michel and Thomas Wright. But there&nbsp;is no commentary on the subject-matter, such as M. d’Avezac&nbsp;attached to his edition of Friar John de Plano Carpini in the same&nbsp;volume. Something has been done to supply this deficiency by the&nbsp;two editions in the Hakluyt Society’s publications, (i.) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">William of&nbsp;Rubrouck. . . John of Pian de Carptne,</span><span class="font0"> trans, and edited by&nbsp;William W. Rockhill (London, 1900); (ii.) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Texts and Versions of&nbsp;. . . Carpini and . . . Rubruquis . . . , </span><span class="font0">edited by C. Raymond&nbsp;Beazley (London, 1903). Richthofen in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">China,</span><span class="font0"> i. 602-4, has&nbsp;briefly but justly noticed Rubrouck. A French version with some&nbsp;notes, issued at Paris in 1877, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque orientale Elzêvirienne&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">hardly deserves mention.

Mr Schuyler points out the true&nbsp;identification of Rubrouck’s river with the Hi, instead of the Chu,&nbsp;which is a much smaller stream ; and other amendments have been&nbsp;derived from Dr F. M. Schmidt (see below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meaning may be put on Rubrouck’s words: “Our going&nbsp;was in winter, our return in summer, and that by a way lying very&nbsp;much farther north, only that for a space of fifteen days’ journey in&nbsp;going and coming we followed a certain river between mountains,&nbsp;and on these there was no grass to be found except close to the river.’’&nbsp;The position of the Chagan Takoi or upper Jabkan seems to suit&nbsp;these facts best; but Mr Schuyler refers them to the upper Irtish,&nbsp;and Dr F. M. Schmidt to the Uliungur.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bashkirs now speak a Turkish dialect; but they are of&nbsp;Finnish race, and it is quite possible that they then spoke </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">language&nbsp;akin to Magyar. There is no doubt that the Mussulman historians&nbsp;of that age identified the Hungarians and the Bashkirs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> see&nbsp;extracts from Juvaini and Rashiduddin in App. to D’Ohsson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hist,&nbsp;des Mongols,</span><span class="font0"> ii. 620-23).
