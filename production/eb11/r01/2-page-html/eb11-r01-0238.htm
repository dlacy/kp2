If </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0"> be the distance of the source below the&nbsp;surface, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l'</span><span class="font0"> the distance of the image, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">µ</span><span class="font0"> the refractive index,&nbsp;then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l'</span><span class="font0">=</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l/µ.</span><span class="font0"> This theory provides a convenient method for&nbsp;determining the refractive index of a plate. A micrometer&nbsp;microscope, with vertical motion, is focused on a scratch on the&nbsp;surface of its stage; the plate, which has a fine scratch on its&nbsp;upper surface, is now introduced, and the microscope is successively&nbsp;focused on the scratch on the stage as viewed through the plate,&nbsp;and on the scratch on the plate. The difference between the first&nbsp;and third readings gives the thickness of the plate, corresponding&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0"> above, and between the second and third readings the depth&nbsp;of the image, corresponding to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Refraction by a Prism,—</span><span class="font0">In optics a prism is a piece of transparent material bounded by two plane faces which meet at a definite angle, called the refracting angle of the prism, in a straight&nbsp;line called the edge of the prism; a section perpendicular to the&nbsp;edge is called a principal section. Parallel rays, refracted successively at the two faces, emerge from the prism as a system of&nbsp;parallel rays, but the direction is altered by an amount called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">deviation.</span><span class="font0"> The deviation depends on the angles of incidence&nbsp;and emergence; but, since the course of a ray may always be&nbsp;reversed, there must be a stationary value, either a maximum&nbsp;or minimum, when the ray traverses the prism symmetrically,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> when the angles of incidence and emergence are equal. As a&nbsp;matter of fact, it is a minimum, and the position is called the&nbsp;angle of minimum deviation. The relation between the minimum&nbsp;deviation D, the angle of the prism </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font0"> and the refractive index&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">µ</span><span class="font0"> is found as follows. Let in fig. 2, PQRS be the course of the </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ray through the prism; the internal angles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø', ψ'</span><span class="font0"> each equal  ½</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font0"> and the angles of incidence and emergence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø, ψ</span><span class="font0"> are each equal&nbsp;and connected with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø' </span><span class="font0">by Snell’s law, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø = μ</span><span class="font0"> sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø'</span><span class="font0">. Also the&nbsp;deviation D is 2 (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø</span><span class="font0">—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø</span><span class="font0">). Hence µ = sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø</span><span class="font0">/sin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ø'</span><span class="font0"> = sin½ (D+</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0">)/sin½</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Refractometers.—</span><span class="font1">Instruments for determining the refractive indices of media are termed refractometers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The simplest are really spectrometers, consisting of a glass prism, usually hollow and fitted with accurately parallel glass&nbsp;sides, mounted on a table which carries a fixed collimation tube&nbsp;and a movable observing tube, the motion of the latter being&nbsp;recorded* on a graduated circle. The collimation tube has a&nbsp;narrow adjustable slit at its outer end and a lens at the nearer&nbsp;end, so that the light leaves the tube as a parallel beam. The&nbsp;refracting angle of the prism, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> in our previous notation, is determined by placing the prism with its refracting edge towards the&nbsp;collimator, and observing when the reflections of the slit in the&nbsp;two prism faces coincide with the cross-wires in the observing&nbsp;telescope; half the angle between these two positions gives </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.&nbsp;To determine the position of minimum deviation, or D, the prism&nbsp;is removed, and the observing telescope is brought into line with&nbsp;the slit; in this position the graduation is read. The prism is&nbsp;replaced, and the telescope moved until it catches the refracted&nbsp;rays. The prism is now turned about a vertical axis until a&nbsp;position is found when the telescope has to be moved towards the&nbsp;collimator in order to catch the rays; this operation sets the prism&nbsp;at the angle of minimum deviation. The refractive index </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">µ</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;calculated from the formula given above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More readily manipulated and of superior accuracy are refractometers  depending on total reflection. The Abbe refractometer&nbsp;(fig. 3) essentially consists of a double Abbe prism AB to contain&nbsp;the substance to be experimented with; and a telescope F to observe&nbsp; the border line of the total reflection. The prisms, which are&nbsp;right-angled and made of the same flint glass, are mounted in a&nbsp;hinged frame such that the lower prism, which is used for purposes&nbsp;of illumination, can be locked so that the hypothenuse faces are&nbsp;distant by about 0·15 mm., or rotated away from the upper prism.&nbsp;The double prism is used in examining liquids, a few drops being&nbsp;placed between the prisms; the single prism is used when solids&nbsp;or plastic bodies are employed. The mount is capable of rotation&nbsp;about a horizontal axis by an alidade </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">J.</span><span class="font0"> The telescope is provided&nbsp;with a reticule, which can be brought into exact coincidence&nbsp;with the observed border line, and is rigidly fastened to a sector </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">S graduated directly in refractive indices. The reading is effected by a lens L. Beneath the prisms is a mirror for reflecting light </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">into the apparatus. To use the apparatus, the liquid having been inserted between the prisms, or the solid attached by its own&nbsp;adhesiveness or by a drop of monobromnaphthalene to the upper&nbsp;prism, the prism case is rotated until the field of view consists of a&nbsp;light and dark portion, and the border line is now brought into&nbsp;coincidence with the reticule of the telescope. In using a lamp&nbsp;or daylight this border is coloured, and hence a compensator,&nbsp;consisting of two equal Amici prisms, is placed between the&nbsp;objective and the prisms. These Amici prisms can be rotated,&nbsp;in opposite directions, until they produce a dispersion opposite&nbsp;in sign to that originally seen, and hence the border line now&nbsp;appears perfectly sharp and colourless. When at zero the alidade&nbsp;corresponds to a refractive index of 1·3, and any other reading&nbsp;gives the corresponding index correct to about 2 units in the 4th&nbsp;decimal place. Since temperature markedly affects the refractive&nbsp;index, this apparatus is provided with a device for heating the prisms.&nbsp;Figs. 4 and 5 show the course of the rays when a solid and liquid</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">are being experimented with. Dr R. Wollny’s butter refractometer, also made by Zeiss, is constructed similarly to Abbe’s form, with the exception that the prism casing is rigidly attached&nbsp;to the telescope, and the observation made by noting the point where&nbsp;the border line intersects an appropriately graduated scale in the&nbsp;focal plane of the telescope objective, fractions being read by a&nbsp;micrometer screw attached to the objective. This apparatus is&nbsp;also provided with an arrangement for heating. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This method of reading is also employed in Zeiss’s “ dipping refractometer ” (fig. 6). This instrument consists of a telescope R&nbsp;having at its lower end a prism P with a refracting angle of 63°,&nbsp;above which and below the objective is a movable compensator A&nbsp;for purposes of annulling the dispersion about the border line.
