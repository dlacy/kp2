<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for the county of Middlesex (7 Anne c. 20), for the West Riding of Yorkshire (2 &amp; 3 Anne c. 4), and for the East Riding and&nbsp;Kingston-upon-Hull (6 Anne c. 35). Similar provisions were not&nbsp;applied to the North Riding until 8 Geo. II. c. 6. The Yorkshire&nbsp;Acts were consolidated and amended by the Yorkshire Registries&nbsp;Act, 1884.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Under these Acts, all deeds are to be adjudged</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration, unless a memorial of such deeds be duly registered before the registering of the memorial of the&nbsp;deed under which such subsequent purchaser or mortgagee shall&nbsp;claim” (Williams, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pt. i. ch. x.). Priority thus&nbsp;depends upon the date of registration. The Acts do not extend to&nbsp;copyholds, to leaseholds for a term not exceeding twenty-one years,&nbsp;or to chambers in an Inn of Court. The full operation of the&nbsp;Registry Acts has been to a certain extent affected by the doctrines&nbsp;of equity that an equitable mortgage by deposit of deeds is valid&nbsp;without registration, and that notice of a prior unregistered deed&nbsp;is within limits equivalent to registration. “ It shall only be in&nbsp;cases where the notice is so clearly proved as to make it fraudulent in the purchaser to take and register a conveyance in prejudice to the known title of another that we will suffer the registered&nbsp;deed to be affected” (Sir William Grant in Wyatt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Barwell,&nbsp;19 Vesey’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reports,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">438). On this subject the Yorkshire Registries&nbsp;Act, 1884, provides by § 14 that “all priorities given by this Act&nbsp;shall have full effect in all cases except in cases of actual fraud, and&nbsp;all persons claiming thereunder any legal or equitable interests&nbsp;shall be entitled to corresponding priorities, and no such person&nbsp;shall lose any such priority merely in consequence of his having been&nbsp;affected with actual or constructive notice, except in cases of actual&nbsp;fraud. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Act provides for an official search of the same nature&nbsp;as that introduced by the Conveyancing Act, 1882, and for the&nbsp;entry of a caveat against registration ·by any person interested.&nbsp;Passing to general registration, a general registry of deeds was&nbsp;recommended by the real property commissioners in 1830. The&nbsp;royal commission of 1854 reported in 1857 in favour of general&nbsp;registration of title. In pursuance of this report the Land&nbsp;Registry Act, 1862 (“Lord Westbury’s Act”), was passed. It&nbsp;provided for the optional registration of such titles to freeholds&nbsp;and leaseholds in freeholds as a court of equity should hold to be&nbsp;marketable. It was of little importance in practice on account of its&nbsp;making a marketable title (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> such a title as the court would&nbsp;■compel an unwilling purchaser to accept) and a definition of&nbsp;boundaries necessary, and of its not giving an indefeasible title in&nbsp;effect, though it does so in name, until there had been dealing with&nbsp;the land for valuable consideration subsequent to registration.&nbsp;The Act is still law as to titles registered under it and not reregistered under the Act of 1875. On the same day as the Land&nbsp;Registry Act was passed the Declaration of Title Act, 1862, under&nbsp;which power is given to any person entitled to apply for the&nbsp;registration of an indefeasible title under the Land Registry Act to&nbsp;apply to the Court of Chancery for a declaration of title, and the&nbsp;court, on proof of a marketable title, is to issue a certificate of title&nbsp;under the seal of the court. The Land Registry Act was condemned by the report of a royal commission in 1870. In 1875&nbsp;some of the recommendations of the commission were adopted in&nbsp;the Land Transfer Act, 1875 (“Lord Cairns’s Act”), the latest&nbsp;general enactment on the subject. The Act of 1875 allows the&nbsp;optional registration of a title less than marketable, and the land&nbsp;certificate delivered to the proprietor is to state whether his title&nbsp;be absolute, qualified, or possessory. Two or more persons may be&nbsp;registered as joint proprietors. No notice of any trust is to appear&nbsp;on the register. To be registered land must be either freehold or&nbsp;leasehold for an unexpired term of at least twenty-one years.&nbsp;Land in Middlesex or Yorkshire registered under the Act ceases to&nbsp;be within the jurisdiction of the local registries. A caution against&nbsp;registration may be lodged by any person interested. The Act&nbsp;established an office of land registry under a registrar appointed by&nbsp;the lord chancellor. There was also a power of creating district&nbsp;registries, if necessary. The Act, like its predecessor, lias been&nbsp;very little used. A compulsory system of registration of title in&nbsp;England has been so universally recognized as expedient that its&nbsp;adoption can only be a question of time. The chief difficulties in&nbsp;the way of a reform are the objection of the landowners to publicity of transactions in land, the expense, greater than in other&nbsp;countries or in the colonies, arising from the complexity of the&nbsp;English law of real property, and, not least, the conservative&nbsp;instincts of the legal profession. One effect of registration will&nbsp;be to much diminish the importance of the legal doctrines of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Possession </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Limitation </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.). “It is a grave question&nbsp;whether the establishment of titles by long possession is consistent&nbsp;with a complete and efficient system of registration. In Scotland,&nbsp;where there is such a system, there is nothing answering to our&nbsp;Statute of Limitations as regards land” (Pollock, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Land Laws,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 169).@@<sup>1</sup></span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup></span><span class="font0"> § 21 of the Act of 1S75 in fact provides that “ a title to any land adverse to or in derogation of the title of the registered proprietor shall not be acquired by&nbsp;any length of possession,&quot; ■with an exception in favour of an adverse claim where&nbsp;the registered title is possessory only.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Another effect will be the recurrence to the primitive legal conception of the transfer of land as a matter of public notoriety. In Ireland a registry of assurances was established by 6 Anne c. 2 (Ir.).&nbsp;28 &amp; 29 Viet. c. 88 constitutes a limited registry of title in the&nbsp;record of title to land which has been the subject of conveyance or&nbsp;declaration by the Landed Estates Court. In Scotland the present&nbsp;system of registration of assurances has existed since the reign of&nbsp;James YI. The Act 1617 c. 16 created a public register for&nbsp;registering within three-score days instruments of sasine as well as&nbsp;reversions and other writs affecting heritable property. The Act&nbsp;established a general register of sasines at Edinburgh and local&nbsp;registers. The latter were abolished by 31 &amp; 32 Viet. c. 64.&nbsp;Modern Acts commencing in 1845 and consolidated in 1868 by 31&nbsp;&amp; 32 Viet. c. 101 dispense with sasine and the instrument&nbsp;of sasine. The recording of a conveyance with a warrant of&nbsp;registration indorsed now constitutes infeftment. Either the&nbsp;whole or part of a deed may be registered. Probative leases of&nbsp;thirty-one or more years may be registered under 20 &amp; 21 Viet,&nbsp;c. 26. As to entails see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Entail. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Writs affecting land held in&nbsp;burgage before 1874 must be registered in the burgh register&nbsp;of sasines (37 &amp; 38 Viet. c. 94, § 25). The lord clerk register’s&nbsp;duties under the Act of 1617 were transferred to the deputy clerk&nbsp;register by 42 &amp; 43 Viet. c. 44 (see Watson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law Diet., s.vv.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Deeds,”&nbsp;“ Registration”). In most of the British colonies land registration&nbsp;of some kind exists. The Indian Registration Act, 1866, steers a&nbsp;middle course between compulsory and optional registration. The&nbsp;registration of some assurances is compulsory, of others optional.&nbsp;In Australia a system of compulsory registration of title was&nbsp;introduced by Sir R. R. Torrens, and, after having been first&nbsp;adopted by the legislature of South Australia in 1858, has been&nbsp;generally applied by the other Australian colonies since that time.&nbsp;Under the South Australian Act a certificate of title is cancelled and&nbsp;regranted on transfer. Instruments are not effectual until registration and indorsement according to statutory forms. Mortgages&nbsp;have priority according to the date of registration, irrespective of&nbsp;notice. The registrar may demand the deposit of a map. In the&nbsp;United States registration of assurances is universal, but registration&nbsp;of title is not so generally adopted. At the date of writing, a bill&nbsp;for the compulsory registration of title is before the New York&nbsp;legislature. For the purpose of dealing with public lands of the&nbsp;United States a register of the land office is appointed in each land&nbsp;district. Returns from each land office are made to the general&nbsp;land office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ships</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The registration of ships in the British empire (other than fishing boats, the registration of which is governed by special&nbsp;legislation) now depends upon the Merchant Shipping Acts. The&nbsp;register is open only to British ships, and not more than sixty-four&nbsp;persons can be registered as owners of any ship. One registered&nbsp;owner may, however, represent the beneficial title of any number&nbsp;of persons. No notice of a trust can be entered on the register.&nbsp;Mortgages must be registered in the statutory form in order to be&nbsp;good against registered transferees and mortgagees. The registrar&nbsp;is generally in the United Kingdom the principal officer of customs&nbsp;for any port, abroad such person as may be named by order in&nbsp;council. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, established a “general&nbsp;register and record of seamen ” under a registrar-general of seamen.&nbsp;The Merchant Shipping Act, 1872, extended both the name and&nbsp;authority of this officer. Since that Act he has been called the&nbsp;registrar-general of shipping and seamen. Returns of shipping&nbsp;and seamen are transmitted to him by the local registrars. In the&nbsp;United States the registration of ships depends upon a series of&nbsp;Acts of Congress beginning in 1792. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Revised Statutes,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> § 4131.&nbsp;A register of seamen is kept by the shipping commissioner (Act of&nbsp;7th June 1872, c. 322).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bills of Sale</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By the Bills of Sale Acts, 1878 and 1882, every bill of sale is to be registered within seven clear days after the&nbsp;execution thereof, or, if it is executed in any place out of England,&nbsp;then within seven clear days after the time at which it would in&nbsp;the ordinary course of post arrive in England if posted immediately&nbsp;after execution. A bill must be re-registered every five years, if&nbsp;still existing. An affidavit of the time of its execution, of its due&nbsp;execution and attestation, and containing a description of the&nbsp;residence and occupation of the person making the bill and of every&nbsp;attesting witness, must be filed with the registrar within seven&nbsp;days. A transfer or assignment of a registered bill of sale need&nbsp;not be registered. The duties of registrar are performed by a&nbsp;master of the Supreme Court attached to the Queen’s Bench Division&nbsp;of the High Court of Justice. Provision is made for the transmission of bills of sale made by persons or affecting goods outside the&nbsp;London bankruptcy district to the registrars of the proper county&nbsp;courts. The register may be searched by any person on payment&nbsp;of a fee of one shilling. Similar provisions are contained in the&nbsp;Irish Acts of 1879 and 1883. Bills of sale are unknown in&nbsp;Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Births, Baptisms, Marriages, Deaths, Burials</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The registration of baptisms, marriages, and burials is said to have been first introduced by Thomas Cromwell when vicar-general in 1522, but it is</span></p>
