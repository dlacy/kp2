From these tables, it will be evident that the prices of the materials comprising the permanent way, will very rarely be greater or less than the rates at which they are given ; and that consequently it is no longer a question, as far as expense is concerned, which is the best mode of laying a railway.
In these tables we have exhibited each item separately, in order that the component parts of the expense may be seen, as well as the gross sum. The right-hand column in each table shews the price of one yard of single rail, or one-fourth the price of two lines of rails. In Table I. the rails are taken at L.14 per ton, to include freight and carriage, and lOs. as the price of a block, containing five square feet of stone, with its chair, &c., complete, including carriage ; but in each table the cost of laying the way is excluded. This price for the block will give 8s. for a two-feet rail, which may be thus divided :—

In calculating for any intermediate lengths not in the table, for every tenth of a foot increase in the length of bearing, add 2 lbs. to the weight per yard, and 2∙4d. to the price per block, in each case to the tabular number, in a line with that length to which the addition is made. Thus, for 2∙2 feet say 44 lbs. per yard, and 8s. 4-8d. for the block ; and when a different price is taken for the block, increase it 5 ⅛th for each 3 inches of increase in the length of the rail, and proportionally for all other lengths.
The minimum price in Table I. is when the length of bearing is 2∙2 feet, being then I6s. ll*45d. per yard single rail.
Table II. is computed to shew that if we take the same proportion for the blocks as in Table I., and at the same time keep the total expense per yard the same at all lengths, we shall have too little money left to get an efficient rail ; it is calculated, by turning the price of the blocks in Table I. into the price per yard, and subtracting this from 17s., the remainder will be the price of the rail per yard, which, at l½d. per lb., will shew how heavy
a
rail can be got for that price. Thus, we see that we can only have8lbs. more in a five-feet rail than we ought to have in athree-feet; besides which, we cannot get up to our standard, namely, 60 lb. at three-feet bearings.
Table III. shews the comparative cost with the rails at l¼d. per lb., or L.ll, 13s. 4d. per ton, and the minimum laying between 2¼ and 2¾ feet of bearing, we shall shew how to ascertain where it exactly is, which method answers for the other similar tables. Let us first take 2-6 feet for the length of bearing, and adding, as before directed, 2 lbs. for this additional tenth of a foot, to the weight for 2-5 feet, we get 52 lbs. per yard, as the weight at 2∙6 feet, and 3 feet : 52 lbs. = 2∙6 feet : 45Ό66 lbs. for the weight per rail, which at 1 ¾d. per lb. is 56∙332d. The price of a block for a 2∙5 feet length is 108d., and adding 2∙4, we get 110∙4d. for the block at 2∙6 feet ; and this added to the price per rail, gives 166∙732d. for the total price per rail, or nearly 13s. 10¾d. Thus, as 2∙6 feet : 166∙732d. = 3 feet : 16s. 0∙38d. for the price per yard complete of single rail, whereas at 2∙5 feet it is 16s. 0∙ld.; hence the minimum lies between 2∙25 and 2∙5 feet, and not between 2∙5 and 2∙75 feet.
Resuming our trial with 2∙4 feet, we have 45 + 3 = 48 lbs. for the weight per yard at 2∙4 feet, and 3 feet : 48 lbs. = 2∙4 feet : 38∙4 lbs. per rail, which at l¼d. per yard, costs 4s. The price of the block at 2∙25 feet is 102d., and adding 3∙6d. we get 105∙6d. for the block at 2∙4 feet ; that added to the price of the rail, gives a total of 12s. 9∙6d., and as 2∙4 feet : 153∙6d. = 3 feet : 192d. or 16s. 0d., whereas the price at 2∙5 feet is lfis. 0∙ld. In the same way we may repeat the calculation till we arrive at what extent of accuracy we choose.
Having seen the effect which lowering the price of iron has, we know that by raising it, we should find it cheaper to put the blocks close together than our first table indicated ; thus, if iron is l¾d. per lb., we have for 2-feet rails 3s. 10∙666d. as the price of the rail, and Ils. l0∙666d. as the price of the rail and block complete, which gives us 17s. 10d. as the price per yard, whereas with 2∙25 feet rails it would be 4s. ll∙0625d. the rail, and 13s. 5∙0625d. for the rail and block, or 17s. 10¾d. per yard.
