(in ancient mythology), a ſpecies of demi gods who dwelt in the woods. They are repreſented as monſters, half-men, and half-goats; having horns on their heads, a hairy body, with the feet and tail of a goat. They are generally in the train that follows Bacchus. As the poets ſuppoſed that they were remarkable ſor piercing eyes and keen raillery, they have placed them in the ſame pictures with the Graces, Loves, and even with Venus herſelſ.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
