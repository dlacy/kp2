The firmer woods, such as oak and chestnut, may be supposed to be but slightly compressible ; we know that willow and other soft woods are very compressible. These last must therefore be weaker ; for it is evident, that the fibres which are in a state of compression do not resist the fracture. It is well known, that a beam of willow may be cut through from C to <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  without weakening it in the least, if the cut be filled up by a wedge of hard wood stuck in.</p><p>We can only say, that very sound oak and red fir have the centre of effort so situated, that the absolute strength is to the relative strength in a proportion of not less than that of three and a half times the length of the beam to its depth. A square inch of sound oak will carry about 8000 pounds. If this bar be firmly fixed in a wall, and project twelve inches, and be loaded at the extremity with 200 pounds, it will be broken. It will just bear 190, its relative strength being ⅛ of its absolute strength ; and this is the case only with the finest pieces, so placed that their annual plates or layers are in a vertical position. A larger log is not so strong transversely, because its plates lie in various directions round the heart.</p><p>These observations are enough to give us a distinct notion of the vast diminution of the strength of timber when the strain is across it ; and we see the justice of the maxim which we inculcated, that the carpenter, in framing roofs, should avoid as much as possible the exposing his timbers to transverse strains. But this cannot be avoided in all cases. Nay, the ultimate strain arising from the very nature of a roof is transverse. The rafters must carry their own weight, and this tends to break them across. An oak beam a foot deep will not carry its own weight if it project more than sixty feet. Besides this, the rafters must carry the lead, tiling, or slates. We must therefore consider this transverse strain a little more particularly, so as to know what strain will be laid on any part by an unavoidable load, imposed either at that part or at any other.</p><p>We have hitherto supposed, that the beam had one of its ends fixed in a wall, and that it was loaded at the other end. This is not an usual arrangement, and was taken merely as affording a simple application of the mechanical principles. It is much more usual to have the beam supported at the ends, and loaded in the middle. Let the beam FEGH (fig. 2) rest on the props</p><p>E and G, and be loaded</p><p>at its middle point C with</p><p>a weight W. It is re</p><p>quired to determine the</p><p>strain at the section CD.</p><p>It is plain that the beam</p><p>will receive the same</p><p>support, and suffer the</p><p>same strain, if, instead</p><p>of the blocks E and G,</p><p>we substitute the ropes <hi rend="italic">Ffe, Hhg,</hi>  going over the pulleys <hi rend="italic">f </hi>and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>  and loaded with proper weights e and <hi rend="italic">g.</hi>  The weight e is equal to the support given by the block E ; and <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  is equal to the support given by G. The sιun of <hi rend="italic">e</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  is equal to W ; and on whatever point W is hung, the weights e and <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  are to W in the proportion of DG and DE to GE. Now, in this state of things, it appears that the strain on the section CD arises immediately from the upward action of the ropes <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi>  and HA, or the upward pressions of the blocks E and G ; and that the office of the weight W is to oblige the beam to oppose this strain. Things are in the same state in respect, of strain as if a block were substituted at D for the weight W, and the weights e and <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  were hung on at E and G, only the directions will be opposite. The bcam tends to break in the section CD, because the ropes pull it upwards at E and G, whilst a weight W holds it down at C. It tends to open at D, and C becomes the centre of fracture. The strain therefore is the same as if the half ED were fixed in the wall, and a weight equal to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>  that is, to the half of W, were hung on at G.</p><p>Hence we conclude, that a beam supported at both ends, but not fixed there, and loaded in the middle, will carry four times as much weight as it can carry at its extremity, when the other extremity is fast in a wall.</p><p>The strain occasioned at any point L by a weight W, DE</p><p>hung on at any other point D, is = W × -gθ × LG. For</p><p>EG is to ED as W to the pressure occasioned at G. This would be balanced by some weight <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  acting over the pulley A ,∙ and this tends to break the beam at L, by acting</p><p>DE</p><p>on the lever GL. The pressure at G is W × ==, and there-EG</p><p>DE</p><p>fore the strain at L is W X ■== × LG.</p><p>EG</p><p>In like manner, the strain occasioned at the point D by DE</p><p>the weight W huDg on there, is W χ <hi rend="sub">7</hi>= × DG ; which is EG</p><p>therefore equal to ½ W when D is the middle point.</p><p>Hence we see that the general strain on the beam arising from one weight, is proportional to the rectangle of the parts of the beam (for — * DE^×DG '<hi rend="sup">s as x</hi>  DG),</p><p>and is greatest when the load is laid on the middle of the bcam.</p><p>We also see, that the strain at L by a load at D, is equal to the strain at D by the same load at L. And the strain at L from a load at D is to the strain by the same load at L as DE to LE. These are all very obvious corollaries, and they sufficiently inform us concerning the strains which are produced on any part of the timber by a load laid on any other part.</p><p>If we now suppose the beam to be fixed at the two ends, that is, firmly framed or held down by blocks at I and K, placed beyond E and G, or framed into posts, it will carry twice as much as when its ends were free. For suppose it sawn through at CD, the weight W hung on there will be just sufficient to break it at E and G. Now restore the connection of the section CD, it will require another weight W to break it there at the same time.</p><p>Therefore, when a rafter, or any piece of timber, is firmly connected with three fixed points, G, E, I, it will bear a greater load between any two of them than if its connection with the remote point were removed ; and if it be fastened in four points, G, E, I, K, it will be twice as strong in the middle part as without the two remote connections.</p><p>One is apt to expect from this that the joist of a floor will be much strengthened by being firmly built in the wall. It is a little strengthened ; but the hold which can thus be given to it is much too short to be of any sensible service, and it tends greatly to shatter the wall, because, when it is bent down by a load, it forces up the wall with a momentum of a long lever. Judicious builders therefore take care not to bind the joists tight in the wall. But when the joists of adjoining rooms lie in the same direction, it is a great advantage to make them of one piece. They are then twice as strong as when made in two lengths.</p><p>It is easy to deduce from these premises the strain on any point which arises from the weight of the beam itself, or from any load which is uniformly diffused over the whole or any part. We may always consider the whole of the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
