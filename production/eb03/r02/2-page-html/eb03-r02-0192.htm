<p><span class="font1">there expoſe his baſeneſs and her own, invoking all the furies to her aſſiſtance. Theſe menaces ſerved to&nbsp;alarm the ſuſpicions of Nero ; who, though apparently&nbsp;guided by his governors, yet had begun to give way&nbsp;to his natural depravity. He, therefore, determined&nbsp;upon the death of Britannicus, and contrived lo have&nbsp;him poiſoned at a public banquet. Agrippina, however, ſtill retained her natural ferocity : ſhe took every&nbsp;opportunity of obliging and flattering the tribunes and&nbsp;centurions ; ſhe heaped up treaſures with a rapacity&nbsp;beyond her natural avarice ; all her actions ſeemed calculated to raiſe a faction, and make herſelf formidable to&nbsp;the emperor. Whereupon Nero commanded her German&nbsp;guard to be taken ſrom her, and obliged her to lodge&nbsp;out of the palace. He alſo forbid particular perſons&nbsp;to viſit her, and went himſelf but rarely and ceremo-niouſly to pay her his reſpects. She now, therefore,&nbsp;began to find, that, with the emperor’s favour, ſhe had&nbsp;loſt the aſſiduity of her friends. She was even accuſed&nbsp;by Silana of conſpiring againſt her ſon, and of deſigning to marry Plautius, a perſon deſeended from Auguſtus, and of making him emperor. A ſhort time&nbsp;aſter, Pallas, her favourite, together with Burrhus,&nbsp;were arralgned for a ſimilar offence, and intending to&nbsp;ſet up Cornelius Sylla. Theſe informations being proved void of any foundation, the informers were baniſhed ; a puniſhment which was conſidered as very inadequate to the greatneſs of the offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Nero increaſed in years, his crimes ſeemed to increaſe in equal proportion. He now began to find a&nbsp;pleaſure in running about the city by night, diſguiſed&nbsp;like a ſlave. In this vile habit he entered taverns and&nbsp;brothels, attended' by the lewd miniſters of his pleaſure,«, attempting the lives </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">ſuch as oppoſed him,&nbsp;and frequently endangering his own. In imitation of&nbsp;the emperor’s example, numbers of profligate young&nbsp;jr en inſeſted the ſtreets likewiſe ; ſo that every night&nbsp;the city was filled with tumult and diſorder. However, the people bore all theſe levities, which they aſ-cribed to the emperor’s youth, with patience, having&nbsp;occaſion every day to experience his liberality, and having alſo been gratified by the abolition of many of&nbsp;their taxes. The provinces alſo were no way affected&nbsp;by theſe riots ; for except diſturbances on the ſide of&nbsp;the Parthians, which were ſoon ſuppreſſed, they enjoyed&nbsp;the moſt perfect tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But thoſe ſenſualitie», which, ſor the firſt four years of his reign, produced but tew diſorders, in the fifth&nbsp;became alarming. He firſt began to tranſgreſs the&nbsp;bounds of decency, by publicly abandoning Octavia,&nbsp;his preſent wife, and then by taking Poppea, the wiſe&nbsp;of his favourite Otho, a woman more celebrated ſor&nbsp;her beauty than her virtues. This was another grating&nbsp;circumſtance to Agrippina, who vainly uſed all her intereſt to diſgrace Poppea, and reinſtate herſelf in her&nbsp;ſon’s loſt favour. Hiſtorians aſſert, that ſhe even offered to ſatisfy his paſſion herſelf, by an inceſtuous compliance and that, had not Seneca interpoſed, the ſon&nbsp;would have joined in the mother’s crime. This, however, does not ſeem probable, ſince we find Poppea vic-torious, ſoon after, in the contention of intereſts ;· and&nbsp;at laſt impelling Nero to parricide, to ſatisfy her revenge. She began her aits by urging him to divorce&nbsp;his preſent wife, and marry herſelf : ſhe reproached him&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ύ</span><span class="font1"> pupil, who wanted not only power over others, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">liberty to direct himſelf. She inſinuated the danger0u3 deſigns of Agrippina ; and, by degrees, accuſtomed&nbsp;his mind to reflect on parricide without horror, H13&nbsp;cruelties againſt his mother began rather by various circumſtances of petty malice than by any downright in.&nbsp;jury. He encouraged ſeveral perlons to teaſe her with&nbsp;litigious ſuits; and employed ſome of the meaneſt of&nbsp;the people to ling ſatirical ſongs againſt her, under her&nbsp;windows : but, at laſt, finding theſe ineffectual in&nbsp;breaking her ſpirit, he reſolved on putting her to death.&nbsp;His firſt attempt was by poiſon ; but this, though twice&nbsp;repeated, proved ineffectual, as ſhe had fortified her&nbsp;conſtitution againſt it by antidotes. This failing, a ſhip&nbsp;was contrived in ſo artificial a manner as to fall 10 pieces&nbsp;in the water ; on board of which ſhe was invited to ſail&nbsp;to the coaſts of Calabria. However, this plot was as&nbsp;ineffectual as the former : the mariners, not being ap-priſed of the ſecret, diſturbed each other’s operations ;&nbsp;ſo that the ſhip not finking as readily as was expected,&nbsp;Agrippina found means to continue ſwimming, till ſhe&nbsp;was taken up by ſome trading veſſels paſſing that way.&nbsp;Nero finding all his machinations were diſcovered, reſolved to throw off the maſk, and put her openly to&nbsp;death, without further delay. He therefore cauſed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">report to be ſpread, that ſhe had conſpired againſt him,&nbsp;and that a poniard was dropped at his ſeet by one who&nbsp;pretended a command from Agrippina to aſſaſſinate&nbsp;him. In conſequence of this, he applied to his governors Seneca and Burrhus, for their advice how to act,&nbsp;and their aſſiſtance in ridding him of his fears. Things&nbsp;were now come to ſuch a criſis, that no middle way&nbsp;could bε taken ; and either Nero or Agrippina was to&nbsp;fall. Seneca, therefore, kept a profound ſilence ; while&nbsp;Burt hus, with more reſolution, refuſed to be perpetrator of ſo great a crime ; alleging, that the army was&nbsp;entirely devoted to all the deicendants of Cæſar, and&nbsp;would never be brought to imbrue their hands in the&nbsp;blood of any of his family. In this embarraſſment,&nbsp;Anicetus, the contriver of the ſhip above-mentioned,&nbsp;offered his ſervices ; which Nero accepted with the&nbsp;greateſt joy, crying out, “ That then was the firſt moment he ever found himſelſ an emperor.” This freedman, therefore, taking with him a body of ſoldiers,&nbsp;ſurrounded the houſe of Agrippina, and then forced&nbsp;open the doors. The executioners having diſpatched her&nbsp;with ſeveral wounds, left her dead on the couch, and&nbsp;went to inform Nero of what they had done. Some&nbsp;hiſtorians ſay, that Nero came immediately to view the&nbsp;body ; that he continued to gaze upon it with pleaſure,&nbsp;and ended his horrid ſurvey, by coolly obſerving, that&nbsp;he never thought his mother had been ſo handſome»—&nbsp;However this be, he vindicated his conduct, next day&nbsp;to the ſenate ; who not only excuſed, but applauded&nbsp;his impiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">AH the bounds of virtue being thus broken down,. Nero now gave a looſe to his appetites* that were not&nbsp;only fordid but inhuman. There ſeemed an odd cop-traſt in his diſpoſition ; for while he practiſed cruelties&nbsp;which were ſufficient to make the mind ſhudder with&nbsp;horror, he was fond of thoſe amuſing arts that ſoften&nbsp;and refine the heart. He was particularly addicted, even,&nbsp;from childhood, to muſic, and not totally ignorant of&nbsp;poetry. But chariot-driving was his favourite purſuit.&nbsp;He never miſſed the circus, when chariot-races were to&nbsp;be exhibited there ; appearing at firſt privately, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
