<p><span class="font2">of Rome, and the surveillance of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">consilium domesticum, </span><span class="font2">the recognition of this principle produced no evil results;&nbsp;family misunderstandings were easily smoothed over, and&nbsp;divorces were of rare occurrence. But from the time of&nbsp;the enactment of the Maenian law in 586 there seems to&nbsp;have been a change for the worse. It </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span><span class="font2"> displaced&nbsp;the family council as a divorce court and transferred its&nbsp;functions in that matter to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a, judicium de moribus,—a</span><span class="font2"> court&nbsp;of inquiry nominated by the praetor, and having as its&nbsp;duty to decide to what extent there should be forfeiture of&nbsp;the nuptial provisions in case of separation or repudiation.&nbsp;The motives of the statute may have been of the best; but&nbsp;its tendency was injurious, for not only did it indirectly&nbsp;facilitate divorce, but it rendered the idea of it familiar,&nbsp;and overthrew that respect for the domestic council which&nbsp;had hitherto been a check upon it. What wonder that&nbsp;with increasing luxury and licentiousness divorce became&nbsp;so common !</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This looseness of the marriage bond, as was naturally to be expected, had its effect on the other family relations.&nbsp;The obligation of a father to provide for his children began&nbsp;to be lightly esteemed. The law—possibly only the interpretation put upon the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit</span><span class="font2"> of the XII. Tables—&nbsp;had empowered him testamentarily to disinherit them, or&nbsp;in instituting them to limit their right to a mere fraction&nbsp;of the inheritance; but it was assumed that this power&nbsp;would be exercised with discretion and only when justified&nbsp;by circumstances. But in the latter days of the republic,&nbsp;amid the slackened ties of domestic life, paternal as well&nbsp;as conjugal duty seems to have often been lost sight of,&nbsp;and children disinherited or cut off with a nominal share&nbsp;of the inheritance in order that a stranger might be&nbsp;enriched. This led to the introduction by the centumviral&nbsp;court, without any legislative enactment or praetor’s edict&nbsp;to warrant it, of what was called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">querela inofficiosi&nbsp;testamenti,—</span><span class="font2">challenge of a testament by a child whose&nbsp;natural claims had been capriciously and causelessly disregarded. While the practice may for a time have been&nbsp;hesitating and uncertain, yet before long, through means&nbsp;of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">querela,</span><span class="font2"> the rule came to be established that every&nbsp;child was entitled, notwithstanding the terms of his father’s&nbsp;testament, to at least a fourth </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(gportio legitima, quarta legitima,</span><span class="font2"> the legitim of the law of Scotland and various Continental countries) of what would have come to him had his&nbsp;parent died intestate, unless it appeared that the latter had&nbsp;had adequate grounds for excluding him or limiting him&nbsp;to a smaller share. A parent might in like manner challenge an undutiful testament made by his child to his prejudice ; and in certain cases so might brothers and sisters&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inter se.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The decline of morals had an equally marked effect on the transactions of daily life, calling for precautions and&nbsp;remedies that had not been found requisite in the hey-day&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">ttlcttus</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> twv ' Pw/zatwr. Men no longer relied on each&nbsp;other’s good faith unless backed by stipulations, cautions&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(cautiones),</span><span class="font2"> and guarantees. The Rutilian bankruptcy&nbsp;arrangements and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actio Pauliana</span><span class="font2"> for setting aside&nbsp;alienations in fraud of creditors indicate a laxity in mercantile dealings that was perhaps an inevitable consequence&nbsp;of the growth of trade and commerce. But, that such&nbsp;remedies as, for example, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio rei venditae et traditae&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio non numeratae pecuniae</span><span class="font2"> should have been&nbsp;found necessary—the one an answer to a vendor (with the&nbsp;price in his pocket) who attempted to dispossess his vendee&nbsp;because some of the formalities of conveyance had been&nbsp;neglected, the other an answer to an action on a bond for&nbsp;repayment of money that by some accident had never been&nbsp;advanced—proves that the law had now to encounter fraud&nbsp;in all directions, and that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Graeca fides</span><span class="font2"> had to a great extent&nbsp;displaced the old Roman probity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. Factors of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legislation.—</span><span class="font1">It cannot be said that during the period of nearly two centuries and a half embraced within the present chapter the&nbsp;private law owed much to legislation. The vast majority of the&nbsp;enactments of the time referred to by the historians dealt with&nbsp;constitutional questions, municipal and colonial government,&nbsp;agrarian arrangements, fiscal policy, sumptuary prohibitions,&nbsp;criminal and police regulations, and other matters that affected the&nbsp;public law rather than the private. Those of the latter class mentioned by Gaius and Ulpian in their institutional works barely&nbsp;exceed a score in number ; and of these not above half a dozen can&nbsp;be said to have exercised a permanent influence on the principles&nbsp;(as distinguished from the details) of the law. Most of them were&nbsp;enactments of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis or of</span><span class="font1"> the comitia of the tribes,&nbsp;to which ordinary legislation had passed as more readily convened&nbsp;and more easily worked than the comitia of the centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edicts of the Magistrates@@<sup>1</sup> —</span><span class="font1">The practice of propounding edicts was very ancient, and had been followed by kings and consuls long&nbsp;before the institution of the praetorship. It was one of the most&nbsp;obvious ways of exercising the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> with which the supreme&nbsp;magistrate was invested,—to lay an injunction upon a citizen and&nbsp;enforce his obedience, or to confer upon him some advantage and&nbsp;maintain him in its enjoyment. It was one of the ways in which&nbsp;public order was protected where there had been no invasion of&nbsp;what the law regarded as a right, and where, consequently, there&nbsp;was no remedy by action. That the earlier edicts of the praetors&nbsp;were of this character—issued, that is to say, with reference to&nbsp;particular cases, and what afterwards came to be called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prout res incidit posita—</span><span class="font1">there is little reason to doubt.&nbsp;In time a new class of edicts appeared which got the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta&nbsp;perpetua</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perpetuae jurisdictionis causa proposita),—</span><span class="font1">announcements by the praetor, published on his album (as the white boards&nbsp;displayed for the purpose in the forum were called), of the relief&nbsp;he would be prepared to grant on the application of any one alleging that the state of facts contemplated had arisen. The next&nbsp;year’s praetor was free to adopt the edicts of his predecessor or not;&nbsp;but it was usual for him to do so if they had been found beneficial&nbsp;in practice, he adding to them new provisions suggested by demands made upon past praetors for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina</span><span class="font1"> but which they&nbsp;had not generalized, or even proposing for acceptance some remedy&nbsp;entirely of his own devising. As each new praetor entered upon&nbsp;office he announced his jurisdictional programme,—his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex annua,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as it was called from this particular point of view, by far the&nbsp;greater part of it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tralaticiivm, i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> transmitted from his predecessors,&nbsp;and only a few paragraphs, diminishing in number as time progressed, representing his own contribution. And so it went on in&nbsp;the first years of the empire, until the praetorian function was&nbsp;eclipsed by the imperial; and at last, after having, by instruction&nbsp;of Hadrian, been subjected to revision, and consolidated with the&nbsp;edicts of the peregrin praetors and provincial governors, it was&nbsp;sanctioned as statute law for the empire through the medium of a&nbsp;senatusconsult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is some reason for supposing that the edict attained considerable proportions in the time of Cicero ; for he mentions that, whereas in his youth the XII. Tables had been taught to the&nbsp;boys in school, in his later years these were neglected, and young&nbsp;men directed instead to the praetor’s edicts for their first lessons&nbsp;in law’. Of a few of them the date and authorship are known with&nbsp;tolerable precision ; but of the history of the majority, including&nbsp;some of the most important, such as those introducing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">restitutio in&nbsp;integrum</span><span class="font1"> on the ground of lesion through error, absence, minority,&nbsp;and the like, and those revolutionizing the law of succession, we&nbsp;are to a great extent in the dark. It is not necessary to assume&nbsp;either that the Julian consolidation exhibits all the provisions that&nbsp;from first to last appeared on the album, or that those preserved in&nbsp;it were originally in the shape in which they are there presented.&nbsp;It is much more likely that we have in it only those that had stood&nbsp;the test of generations, and that many of them are the result of the&nbsp;combined wisdom and experience of a series of praetors. It was&nbsp;one of the great advantages the edicts had over legislative enactments that they might be dropped, resumed, or amended by a new&nbsp;praetor according to his judgment of public requirements. For the&nbsp;edict w’as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viva vox juris civilis,—</span><span class="font1">intended to aid, supplement, and&nbsp;correct it in accordance with the ever-changing estimate of public&nbsp;necessities ; and this would have been impossible had its provisions&nbsp;from the first been as stereotyped as they became by the consolidation in the time of Hadrian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span class="font1"> seems to have contained two parts,—the first what may be called the edict or edicts proper, and the second an appendix of&nbsp;styles of actions, &amp;c., whether derived from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> or from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus praetorium.</span><span class="font1"> The contents of the edict proper were in detail very various, but all devoted to an exposition of the ways in&nbsp;which the praetor meant to exercise his jurisdiction during his year</span></p>
