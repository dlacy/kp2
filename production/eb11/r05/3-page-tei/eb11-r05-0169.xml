He was tutor to the tsar Feodor, son of Alexis, and may be said to have helped to introduce the culture of the West into Russia, as he was educated at Kiev, then a portion of Polish territory. Polotzki came to Moscow about 1664. He wrote religious works <hi rend="italic">(Vienets Viery, “</hi>  The Garland of Faith ”), and composed poems and religious dramas <hi rend="italic">(The Prodigal Son, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>  &amp;c.). He has left us some droll verses on the tsar’s new palace of Kolomenskoe, which are very curious doggerel. The artificial lions that roared, moved their eyes, and walked especially delighted him. There does not seem to be any ground for the assertion (often met with even in Russian writers) that Sept®., the sister of Peter the Great, was acquainted with French, and translated some of the plays of Molière.</p><p>And now all things were to be changed. Russia was to adopt the forms of literature in use in the West. One of the chief helpers of Peter the Great in the education of the people was Feofane (Theophanes) Procopovich (1681-1736), author of the Ecclesiastical Regulations and some plays, who advocated the cause of science ; the old school was defended by Stephen Yavorskiy (1658-1722), whose <hi rend="italic">Rock of Faith</hi>  was written to refute the Lutherans and Calvinists. Another remarkable writer of the times of Peter the Great was Pososhkov (b. 1673), a peasant by birth, who produced a valuable work on <hi rend="italic">Poverty and Riches.</hi>  Antiokh Kantemir (1708-1744), son of a former hospodar of Moldavia, wrote some clever satires still read; they are imitated from Boileau. He also translated parts of Horace. Besides his satires, he published versions of Fontenelle’s <hi rend="italic">Pluralité des Mondes</hi>  and the histories of Justin and Cornelius Nepos. He was for some time Russian ambassador at the courts of London and Paris. But more celebrated than these men was Michael Lomonosov (ç.v.). He was an indefatigable writer of verse and prose, and has left odes, tragedies,</p><p>didactic poetry, essays and fragments of epics.</p><p>Vassilii Tatistchev (1686-1750) was the author of a Russian history which is interesting as the first attempt in that field. He was disgraced for peculation, and died at Astrakhan, as governor, in 1750. His work was not given to the world till after his death. There had been a slight sketch published before by Khilkov, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Marrow of Russian History.</hi>  Basil Trediakovski (1703-1769) was born at Astrakhan, and we are told that Peter, passing through that city at the time of his Persian expedition, had Trediakovski pointed out to him as one of the most promising boys of the school there. Whereupon, having questioned him, the tsar said, with truly prophetic insight, “ A busy worker, but master of nothing.” His <hi rend="italic">Telemakhida,</hi>  a poem in which he versified the <hi rend="italic">Télémaque</hi>  of Fénelon, drew upon him the derision of the wits of the time. He had frequently to.endure the rough horse-play of the courtiers, for the position of a literary man at that time in Russia was not altogether a cheerful one. His services, however, to the</p><p>Russian language wvre great.</p><p>From the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth Russian literature made great progress, the French furnishing models.</p><p>Alexander Sumarokov (1718-1777) wrote prose and verse in . abundance-ycomedies, tragedies, idyls, satires and epigrams He is, perhaps, best entitled to remembrance for his plays, which are rhymed, and in the French style. His <hi rend="italic">Dmitri Samozvanets</hi>  (“ Demetrius the Pretender ”) is certainly not without merit. Some of the pieces of Kniazhnin had great success in their time, such as <hi rend="italic">The Chatterbox, The Originals</hi>  and especially <hi rend="italic">The Fatal Carriage.</hi>  He is now almost forgotten. In 1756 the first theatre was opened at St Petersburg, the director being Sumarokov. Up to this time the Russians had acted only religious plays, such as those written by Simeon Polotzki. The reign of Catherine II. (1762-96), herself a voluminous writer, saw the rise of a whole generation of court poets. Everything in Russia was to be forced like plants in a hot-house; she was to have Homers, Pindars, Horaces and Virgils. Michael Kheraskov (1733-1807) wrote besides other poems two enormous epics—the <hi rend="italic">Rossiada</hi>  in twelve books, and <hi rend="italic">Vladimir</hi>  in eighteen; they are now but little read. Hippolitus Bogdanovich (1743-1803) wrote a pretty lyric piece, <hi rend="italic">Dushenka,</hi>  based upon La Fontaine, ana telling the old story of the loves of Cupid and Psyche. With Ivan Khemnitzer begins the long list of fabulists; this halforiental form of literature, so common in countries ruled absolutely, has been very popular in Russia. Khemnitzer</p><p>(1744-1784), whose name seems to imply a German origin, began by translating the fables of Gellert, but afterwards produced original specimens. A writer of real national comedy appeared in Denis von Visin, probably of German extraction, but born at Moscow (1744-1792). His best production is <hi rend="italic">Nedorosl </hi>(“ The Minor ”), in which he satirizes the coarse features of Russian society, the ill-treatment of the serfs, and other matters. He saw France on.the eve of the great Revolution, and has well described what he did see. Russian as he was, and accustomed to serfdom, he was yet astonished at the wretched condition of the French peasants. The great poet of the age of Catherine, the laureate of her glories, was Gabriel Derzhavin (1743-1816). He essayed many styles of composition, ana was a great master of his native language. There is something grandiose, and organ-like in his high-sounding verses; unfortunately he occasionally degenerates into bombast... His versification is perfect; and he had the courage to write satirically of many persons of high rank. His <hi rend="italic">Ode to God</hi>  is the best known of his poems in Western countries. He was a student of Ossian, and of Edward Young, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts.</hi>  Other celebrated poems of Derzhavin are <hi rend="italic">Felitza,^ Odes on the Death of Prince Mestcherskiy, The Nobleman, The Taking of Ismail,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Taking of Warsaw. </hi>His Memoirs were published in 1857.</p><p>An unfortunate author of the days of Catherine was Alexander Radistehev (1749-1802), who, having, in a small work, <hi rend="italic">A Journey to St Petersburg and Moscow,</hi>  spoken too severely of the miserable condition of the serfs, was punished by banishment to Siberia, from which he was afterwards allowed to return, but not till his health had been permanently injured by his sufferings. An equally sad fate befell the spirited writer Nicholas Novikov (1744-1818), who, after having work«! hard as a journalist, and done much for education in Russia, fell . under the suspicion of the government, and was imprisoned by Catherine. On her death he was released by her successor. The short reign of Paul was not favourable to literary production; the censorship of the press was extremely severe, ana many foreign books were excluded from Russia, t</p><p>But a better state of things came with the reign of Alexander, one of the glories of whose day was Nicholai Karamzin <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>  His chief work is his <hi rend="italic">History of the Russian Empire,</hi>  but he appeared in the fourfold aspect of historian, novelist, essayist and poet. Nor need we do more than mention the celebrated Archbishop Platon <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>  Ivan Dmitriev (1760-1837) wrote some pleasing lyrics and epistles, but without much force. He appears from his translations to have been well acquainted with the English poets. Ozerov (1769-1816) wrote a great many tragedies, which are but little read now. They are in rhyming alexandrines. He occasionally handled native subjects with success, as in his <hi rend="italic">Dmitri Donskoy</hi>  (1807) and <hi rend="italic">Yaropolk and Oleg</hi>  (1798). In Ivan Kriloff <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>  the Russians found their most genial fabulist. As Derzhavin was the poet of the age of Catherine, so Vasilii Zhukovskiy (1783-1852) may be said to have been that of the age of Alexander. He is more remarkable, however, as a translator than as an original poet. With him Romanticism began in Russia. He became reader to the.empress and afterwards tutor to her children. In 1802 he published his version of Gray’s <hi rend="italic">Elegy,</hi>  which at once became a highly popular poem in Russia. Zhukovskiy translated many pieces from the German (Goethe, Schiller, Uhland) and English (Byron, Moore, Southey). One of his original productions, “The Poet in the Camp, of the Russian Warriors,” was on the lips of every one at. the time of the War of the. Fatherland <hi rend="italic">(Otechestvennaia Voina)</hi>  in 1812. He produced versions of the episode of Nala and Damayanti from the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi>  of Rustum and Zohrab from the <hi rend="italic">Shah-Namah,</hi>  and of a part of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey. </hi>In the case of these, three masterpieces, however, he was obliged to work from literal translations (mostly German), as he was unacquainted with the original languages. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>  was translated during this period by Gnedich,. who was familiar with Greek. He has produced a faithful, and spirited version, and has naturalized the hexameter in the Russian language with much skill. Constantine Batiushkov (1787-1855) was the author of many elegant poems, and at the outset of his career promised much, but sank into imbecility, and lived in this condition to an advanced age. Merzliakov and Tziganov deserve a passing notice as the writers of songs some of which still keep their popularity. During his short life (i799”<hi rend="sup">I</hi>837) Alexander Pushkin produced many celebrated poems, which will be found enumerated in the article devoted to him (see Pushkin). In Alexander Griboyedov (1795-1829)<hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>  the Russians saw the writer of one of their most clever comedies <hi rend="italic">(Gore ot Uma),</hi>  which may perhaps.be translated “ The Misfortune of being Too Clever ” (lit. “ Grief out of Wit ”). Ivan Kozlov (1774-1838) was author of some pretty original lyrics, ana some translations from the English, among others Burns’s <hi rend="italic">Cottar's Saturday Night.</hi>  He became a cripple and blind, and his misfortunes elicited some cheering and sympathetic lines from Pushkin, which will always be read with pleasure.</p><p>Pushkin found a successor in Michael Lermontov <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>  who</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
