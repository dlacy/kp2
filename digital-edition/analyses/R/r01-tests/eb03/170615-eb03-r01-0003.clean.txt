RABBIT, in zoology. see Lepus. 
The buck rabbits, like our boar cats, will kill the young ones if they can get at them; and the does in the warrens prevent this, by covering their stocks, or nests, with gravel or earth, which they close so artificially up with the hinder part of their bodies, that it is hard to find them out. They never suckle their young ones at any other time than early in the morning and late at night; and always, for eight or ten days, close up the hole at the mouth of the nest, in this careful manner when they go out. After this they begin to leave a small opening, which they increase by degrees; till at length, when they are about three weeks old, the mouth of the hole is left wholly open that they may go out; for they are at that time grown big enough to take care of themselves, and to feed on grass. 
People who keep rabbits tame for profit, breed them in hutches; but these must be kept very neat and clean, else they will be always subject to diseases. Care must be taken also to keep the bucks and does apart till the latter have just kindled; then they are to be turned to the bucks again, and to remain with them till they shun and run from them. 
The general direction for the choosing of tame rabbits is, to pick the largest and fairest; but the breeder should remember that the skins of the silver haired ones sell better than any other. The food of the tame rabbits may be colewort and cabbage leaves, carrots, pars neps, apple rinds, green corn, and vetches, in the time of the year; also vine leaves, grass, fruits, oats, and oatmeal, milk thistles, sow thistles, and the like : but with these moist foods they must always have a pro portionable quantity of the dry foods, as hay, bread, oats, bran, and the like, otherwise they will grow pot bellied, and die. Bran and grains mixed together have been also found to be very good food. In winter they will eat hay, oats, and chaff, and these may be given them three times a day; but when they eat green things, it must be observed that they are not to drink at ail, for it would throw them into a dropsy. At all other times a very little drink serves their turn, but that must always be fresh. when any green herbs or grass are cut for their food, care must be taken that there be no hemlock among it; for though they will eat this greedily among other things when offered to them, yet it is hidden poison to them. 
Rabbits are subject to two principal infirmities. First, the rot, which is caused by giving them too large a quantity of greens, or from giving them fresh gathered with the dew or rain hanging in drops upon them. It is over moitture that always causes this dis ease. The greens therefore are always to be given dry; and a sufficient quantity of hay, or other dry food, intermixed with them, to take up the abundant moisture of their juices. On this account the very best food that can be given them, is the shortest and sweetest hay that can be got, of which one load will serve 200 couples a year; and out of this stock of 200, 200 may be eat in the family, 200 sold to the markets, and a sufficient number kept in cafe of accidents. 
The other general disease of these creatures 
is a sort 
of madness: : may be known by their wallowing 
and tumbling about with their heels upwards, and hop 
ping in an odd manner into their boxes. This distemper is supposed to be owing to the rankness of their feeding; and the general cure is the keeping them low, and giving them the prickly herb called 
tare thistle 
to. eat. 
The general, computation of males and females is, that one buck rabbit will serve for nine does : some al low io to one buck but those who go beyond this, always suffer for it in their breed. 
The wild, rabbits are either to be taken by small cur dogs, or by spaniels bred up to the sport; and the places of hunting those who straggle from their burrows, is under close hedges or bushes, or among cornfields and fresh pastures. The owners use to course them with small greyhounds; and though they are seldom killed this way, yet they are driven back to their burr rows, and are prevented from being a prey to others. The common method is by nets called 
purse nets, 
and ferrets. The ferret is sent into the hole to fetch them out; and the purse net being spread over the hole, takes them as they come out. The ferrets mouths must be muffled, and then the rabbit gets no harm. For the more certain taking of them, it may not be improper to pitch up 
a 
hay net or two, at a small distance from the burrows that are intended to be hunted: thus very few of the number that are attempted will escape. 
some who have not ferrets smoke the rabbits out of their holes with burning brimstone and orpiment. This certainly brings them out into the nets : but. then it is a very troublesome and offensive method; and is very detrimental to the place, as. no rabbit will for a long time, afterwards come near the burrows which have been fumed with those stinking ingredients. 
I he testicle of a rabbit is a very good object for examining the structure of this part of generation in animals. I he whole substance of the testicle in this animalis made up of vessels, which lie in round folds in the manner of the smaller intestines: but then both ends, of each roll meet at their insertion, which seems to be made into the 
ductus nervofus; 
and every one of these little rolls is curiously embroidered with other vessels, which, from their red colour, appear to be arteries and veins. The several little rolls lie in ranges, disposed with an uniformity which is very agreeable to the eye. Every one of these rolls is not a single and entire tube, but each consifts of several tubes, beside the veins and arteries which embroider it. This is best distinguished by the cutting one of the rolls tranfversely, and then examining the cut end with a glass, which will appear to be made up of the cut and open ends of four, five, or more parallel tubes, which together form the roll, or single tube, as it appears to the eye, being all wrapped, up in one common and very thin membrane. Theft are so tender that they cannot be explicated and viewed distinct, as De Graaf tells us those of the testicles of 
a 
rat and of some other animals may. These, however, as well as the others, are only made up of a congeries, of vessels, and the liquors, which are their contents, without any intermediate substance, or anything of that parenchyma which many authors have talked of. The testicles of a bull have the greatest appearance of a sleshy texture of those of any known animal; yet even thefts afford no particle of parenchyma, or flesh, when examined by glasses in any sort of preparation, whether boiled, 

law, soaked in spirits or in whatever other state.
