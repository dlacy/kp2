Οη the ends of the principal of theſe harbours the people have piled up great heaps of ſtones to ſerve as ſignals : " and it is in theſe (ſays Mr Bruce) that the large veffels from Cairo to Jidda, equal in ſize to our large 74 gun-ſhipe (but from the ciſterns of ma-ſon-work built within for holding water, I ſuppoſe double their weight), after navigating their portion of the channel in the day-time, come ſafely and quietly to ut four o’clock in the afternoon ; and in theſe little harbours paſs the night, to ſail into the channel again next morning.”</p><p>The weſtern channel of the Red Sea was choſen, in the days of the Ptolemies, for the track of the Indian and African. Theſe monarchs erected a great number of cities all along the weſtern coaſt ; and notwithſtand-ing the dangers of the navigation, we do not hear that it was ever abandoned on account of them.</p><p>From the obſervations made by our author on the navigation of the Red Sea, he undertakes to point out a ſafe paſſage for large ſhips to the gulph of Suez, ſo that they may be able to judge of the propriety of their own courſe themſelves, without truſting implicitly to the pilots they meet with, who are often very ignorant of their profeſſion. This ſea, according to Mr Bruce, may be divided into four parts, of which the channel ©ccupies two, till near the latitude of 26<hi rend="sup">j</hi>, or that of Coſſair. Οη the weſt it is deep water, with many recks ; and on the eaſt it is full of iſlands, as has been already mentioned. Between theſe iſlands there are channels and harbours of deep water, where ſhips may be protected in any wind ; but a pilot is neceſſary io failing among theſe ſrom Mocha to Suez, and the voyage beſides can be continued only during part of the day. Ships bound to Suez without the conſent of the ſheriſſe of Mecca, that is, without any intention of felling their cargo at Jidda, or paying cuſtom there, ought to take in their freſh water at Mocha ; or it there be any reaſon againſt this, a few hours will carry them to Azab or Saba on the Abyffinian coaſt, where they may be plentifully ſupplied : but it muſt be remembered,</p><p>“ that the people here are <hi rend="italic">Galla,</hi>  the moſt treacherous and villanous wretches on earth.” Here not only •water may be procured, but plenty of ſheep, goats, with ſome myrrh, and incenſe in the proper ſeaſon.·— Great caution, however, muſt be uſed in dealing with the people, as even thoſe of Mocha, who are abſolutely neceſſary to them in their commercial dealings, cannot truſt them without ſurety or hoſtages. Not many years ago, the ſurgeon and mate of the Elgin Eaſt India-man, with ſeveral other ſailors, were murdered by theſe ſavages as they went aſhore to purchaſe myrrh, though they had a letter of ſafe conduit from the ſhekh.</p><p>To ſuch as do not want to be known, our author recommends a low black iſland on the coaſt of Arabia, named <hi rend="italic">Camaran,</hi>  in latitude 15<hi rend="sup">0</hi>  30'. It is diſtinguiſhed by a white houſe or fortrefs on the weſt end of it ; where water is to be had in ſtill greater plenty than at Azab ; but no proviſions, or ſuch only as are very bad, can be procured. If it is neceſſary not to be ſeen at</p><p>all on the coaſt, the iſland of Fooſht is recommended by our author as having excellent water, with a ſaint or monk, whofe office is to keep the wells clean. This is one of the chain of iſlands which ſtretches almoſt acroſs the gulph from Loheia to Maſuah, aad from ac</p><p>tual obſervation by Mr'Bruce, is found to be fituated in N. Lat. 15<hi rend="sup">0</hi>  59' 43 '. E. Long. 42<hi rend="sup">0</hi>  47'. From this to Yambo there is a ſaſe watering-place ; and there is an abſolute neceſſity for having a pilot before you come to Ras Mahomet ; becauſe, over the Ælanitic gulph, the mountains of Aucha, and the Cape itſelf, there is often a thick haze which laſts for many days together, and a number of ſhips are loſt by miſtaking the eaſtern bay or Ælanitic gulph for the entrance of the gulph of Suez ? the former has a ridge of rocks nearly acrofs it. Aſter reaching Sheduan, a large iſlancl, about three leagues farther in a north by weſt direction, there is a bare rock diſtinguiſhed by no particular name ; but ſo ſituated that ſhips ought not to come within three leagues of it. This rock is to be left to the weſtward at the diſtance juſt mentioned ; after paſſing which you meet with ſhoals forming a pretty broad channel, with foundings from 15 to 30 fathoms; and again, on ſtanding directly for Tor, there are two other oval ſands with ſunk rocks in the channel, between which you are to ſteer. Tor may be known at a diſtance by two hills that ſtand near the water ſide ; which, in clear weather, may be ſeen ſix leagues off. Juſt to the ſouth-eaſt of theſe is the town and harbour, where there are ſome palm-trees about the houſes, the more remaιkable, as being the firſt that are ſeen on the coaſt. The foundings in the way to Tor harbour are clean and regular ; " and, by giving the beacon a ſmall birth on the larboard hand, you may haul in a little to the northward, and anchor in five or fix fathom.” In ſpring-tides, it is high water at Tor nearly about 12 o’clock : in the middle of the gulph there is no perceptible tide, but at the ſides it runs at the rate of more than two knots in the hour. Tor itſelf is but a ſmall village, with a convent of monks belonging to thoſe of Mount Sinai. It was taken by Don John de Caſtro, and fortified ſoon after its diſcovery by the Portugneſe ; but has never ſince been a place of any confideration ; ſerving now only for a watering place to the ſhips trading to or from Suez.— From this place there is a diſtinct view of mounts Ho-reb and Sinai, which appear above and behind the others, with their tops frequently covered with ſnow in the winter.</p><p>Mr Bruce next proceeds to confider ſome queſtions which may be reckoned matters of curiofity rather than any thing elſe. Οηε of theſe is concerning the level of the water of this ſea itſelf, which has been ſuppofed ſeveral feet above that of the Mediterranean. " To this (ſays our author) I anſwer, that the fact has been ſup-poſed to be ſo by antiquity, and alleged as a reaſon. why Ptolemy’s canal was made from the bottom of thc Heroopolitic gulph rather than brought due north acroſs the iſthmus of Suez ; in which laſt caſe it was feared it would ſubmerge a great part of Afia Minor.. But who has ever attempted to verify this by experiment ? or who is capable of ſettling the difference of levels, amounting, as ſuppofed, to ſome feet and inches, between two points 120 miles diſtant from each other, over a deſert that has no fettled ſurface, but is chan-ging its height every day ? Beſides, ſince all ſeas are in fact but one, what is it that hinders the Indian ocean to flow to its level ? what is it that keeps the Indian ocean up ? Till this laſt branch of the queſtion is reſol-vcd, I ſhall take it for granted that <hi rend="smallcaps">bo</hi>  ſuch difference</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
