        <body>
            <p>ſhould have a great breadth and depth in proportion to its length, a full bottom, and
                a long and flat floor. But a ſhip of this conſtruction will neither ſail faſt, nor
                carry much ſail.</p>
            <p>If a ſhip be filled out much towards the line of floatation, together with low upper
                works, ſhe will require little ballaſt : and that ſhip which is ſtiff from
                conſtruction is much better adapted for failing faſt than one which, in order to
                carry the ſame quantity of canvas, is obliged to be loaded with a much greater
                weight : for the reſiſtance is as the quantity of water to be removed, or nearly as
                the area of a tranſverſe ſection of the immerſed part of the body at the midship
                frame ; and a body that is broad and ſhallow is much ſtiffer than one of the ſame
                capacity that is narrow and deep. “ The advantages (ſays Mr Gordon**) are numerous,
                important, and obvious. For it is evident, that by enlarging, perhaps doubling, the
                breadth of veſſels, and forming their bottoms flat and well furniſhed with keels,
                they muſt, in the firstplace, become much ſteadier, roll little, if any, and be
                enabled to carry greatly more ſail, and that in a better direction, at the ſame time
                that they would be in no danger of being diſmaſted or overſet, unleſſs the maſts
                were of a moſt extraordinary height indeed. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> They
                would have little or no occaſion for ballaſt, and if any was uſed, could incur leſs
                danger from its ſhifting. <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> That there would be much
                more room upon deck, as well as accommodation below ; the breadth being ſo much
                increaſed without any diminution of the height above the load-water line. <hi
                    rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> That they would deviate much leſs from the intended
                courſe, and penetrate the water much eaſier in the proper direction : for doubling
                the breadth, without any increaſe of weight, would diminiſh the depth or draught of
                water one half ; and though the extent of the directly oppoſmg ſurface would be the
                ſame as before, yet the veſſel in moving would meet with half the former reſiſtance
                only : for so great is the difference between the pressure, force, or reaction, of
                the upper and the under water. <hi rend="italic">Fifthly, </hi>That they would by
                this means be adapted for lying unſupported in docks and harbours when dry, be
                rendered capable of being navigated in ſhallow water, and of being benefited by all
                the advantages attending that very important circumſtance ; and it is particularly
                to he obſerved, that making veſſels which may be navigated in ſhallow water, may, in
                many reſpects, juſtly be regarded as a matter of equal importance with increaſing
                the number of harbours, and improving them, as having identically the ſame effects
                with regard to navigation ; at the ſame time, that the benefits which would result
                from ſuch circumſtances are obtained by this means without either expence, trouble,
                or inconveniency : beſides, it would not only enable veſſels to enter many rivers,
                bays, and creeks, formerly inacceſſible to ſhips of burden, but to proceed to ſuch
                places as are moſt land locked, where they can lie or ride moſt ſecure, and with
                leaſt expence of men and ground tackle. As ſhips of war would carry their guns well
                by being ſo Ready, there could be but little occaſion for a high topside, or much
                height of hull above water ; and as little or no ballaſt would be required, there
                would be no neceſſity, as in other veſſels, for increaſing their weight on that
                account, and thereby pressing them deeper into the water. Theſe are very important
                circum</p>
            <p>ſtances, and would contribute much to improve the sailing of ſuch veſſels.” From
                whence it appears, that there would be united, what has hitherto been deemed
                irreconcileable, the greateſt poſſible ſtability, which is nearly as the area of a
                tranverſe lection of the immerſed part of the body at the midſhip frame : and a body
                that is broad and ſhallow is much ſtiffer than one of the ſame capacity that is
                narrow and deep. A ſhip of this conſtruction may take in a conſiderable cargo in
                proportion to her ſize ; but if deeply loaded will not ſail fast, for then the area
                of a ſection of the immerſed part at the midſhip frame will be very conſiderable,
                and as the sails of ſuch a ſhip muſt neceſſarily be large, more hands will therefore
                be required.</p>
            <p>The leſs the breadth of a ſhip, the fewer hands will be neceſſary to work her ; as in
                that caſe the quantity of ſail will be leſs, and the anchors alſo of leſs weight. We
                ſhall gain much (ſays M. Bouguer) by making the extreme breadth no more than the
                fifth or ſixth part of the length, if, at the ſame time, we diminish the depth
                proportionally ; and likewise this moſt ſurpriſing circumſtance, that by diminiſhing
                these two dimenſions, or by increaſing the length, a ſhip may be made to go
                ſometimes as fall as the wind.</p>
            <p>In order to obtain the preceding properties, very oppoſite rules muſt be followed ;
                and hence it appears to be impoſſible to conſtruct a ſhip ſo as to be posſeſsed of
                them all. The body, however, muſt be ſo formed, that as many of theſe properties may
                be retained as poſſible, always obſerving to give the preference to thoſe which are
                moſt required. If it is known what particular trade the ſhip is to be employed in,
                thoſe qualities are then principally to be adhered to which are moſt eſſentially
                neceſſary for that employment.</p>
            <p>It may easily be demonſtrated that ſmall ſhips will not have the ſame advantages as
                large ones of a similar form, when employed in the ſame trade : for a large ſhip
                will not only ſail faster than a ſmall one of a similar form, but will alſo require
                fewer hands to work her. Hence, in order that a ſmall ſhip may poſſeſs the ſame
                advantages as a large one, the correſponding dimenſions will not be proportional to
                each other. The reader will ſee in Chapman’s Architect<hi rend="italic">ura Navalis
                    Mercatoria </hi>ample tables of the ſeveral dimenſions of ſhips, of different
                claſſes and sizes, deduced from theory combined with experiment. Tables of the
                dimenſions of the principal ſhips of the Britiſh navy, and or other ſhips, are
                contained in the Ship builder’s Repository, and in Murray’s Treatiſe on
                Ship-building.</p>

                of every part of her is to be laid down ; from whence the form and dimenſions of the
                timbers, and of every particular piece of wood that enters into the conſtruction, is
                to be found. As a ſhip has length, breadth, and depth, three different plans at
