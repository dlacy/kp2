<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGNARD, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jean François </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1656-1709), who in general estimation ranks next to Molière among French&nbsp;comic dramatists, was born at Paris in 1656, and daring&nbsp;at least the earlier part of his life had a singularly adventurous career considering his time, station, and country.&nbsp;His father was a rich shopkeeper, who educated his son&nbsp;carefully, and died when he was about twenty, leaving&nbsp;Regnard master of what was for the time a considerable&nbsp;fortune. Regnard, who was apparently beyond his day in&nbsp;affection for travelling, set off at once for Italy and there&nbsp;gambled perseveringly. A young tradesman’s son in such&nbsp;circumstances ought, according to precedent and poetical&nbsp;justice, to have been fleeced to his last penny; but&nbsp;Regnard, according to the story, increased his fortune by&nbsp;ten thousand crowns. In Italy (on his second visit according to some authorities) he met and fell in love with a&nbsp;young married lady of Provençal birth. With her and her&nbsp;husband (it is difficult not to believe that biographers have&nbsp;taken the facts of a short autobiographical romance which&nbsp;Regnard wrote, under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La Provençale</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, rather&nbsp;literally) he set out for France on board an English frigate.&nbsp;This was attacked by two Algerian rovers; the captain and&nbsp;the crew were cut to pieces, and the passengers taken to&nbsp;Algiers and sold. Regnard, who, being skilful in cookery,&nbsp;was a valuable slave, is said to have been taken by his&nbsp;master to Constantinople, but after about two years’ captivity he was ransomed with his lady love for twelve&nbsp;thousand livres. The husband was supposed to be dead, and&nbsp;Regnard was preparing to marry the widow when a proper&nbsp;time of mourning had elapsed, but the husband reappeared&nbsp;and the lover was disappointed. The disappointment set&nbsp;him once more on a roving life, and he journeyed by&nbsp;Holland, Denmark, and Sweden to Lapland, and thence by&nbsp;Poland, Turkey, Hungary, and Germany back to France,&nbsp;having commemorated what was then the somewhat extraordinary feat of visiting the head of the Gulf of Bothnia by&nbsp;a Latin inscription on the rocks, which was visible thirty&nbsp;years later. He returned to Paris at the end of 1683. He&nbsp;now appears to have entirely exhausted his roving inclinations, and for the second half of his life (for this date of&nbsp;December 1683 nearly bisects it) his existence, if not&nbsp;exactly sedentary, was divided between luxury and letters.&nbsp;He bought the place of treasurer of France in the Paris&nbsp;district; he had a house at Paris in the Rue Richelieu; and&nbsp;he acquired the small estate of Grillon near Dourdan (about&nbsp;equidistant between Rambouillet and Fontainebleau), where&nbsp;he hunted, feasted, and wrote comedies. This latter&nbsp;amusement he began in 1688 with a piece called </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Divorce,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which was performed at the Théâtre Italien, and&nbsp;followed it up with many other small pieces, which are&nbsp;not, however, his titles to fame. He gained access to the&nbsp;Théâtre Français in 1694 with a slight piece called </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Attendez-moi sous VOrme,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and two years later produced there the&nbsp;masterly comedy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Joueur,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in reference to which his&nbsp;ally Dufresny attempted to make out a charge of plagiarism. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Distrait</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1697), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Retour Imprévu</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1700), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Les&nbsp;Folies Amoureuses</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1704), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Les Menèchmes</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1705), a clever&nbsp;following of Plautus, and, lastly, his masterpiece, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Légataire Universel</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1708), with one or two less meritorious&nbsp;pieces, were also produced at the Français.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regnard’s death, after a quarter of a century of quiet</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">living, renews the doubtful and romantic circumstances of his earlier life. Some hint at poison ; there is a wild and&nbsp;wonderful story of his having deliberately made up a prescription of horse medicine for himself and taken it with&nbsp;fatal consequences ; while other more prosaic accounts give&nbsp;as the cause of death his having gone out hunting while&nbsp;under an ordinary course of treatment, and on his return,&nbsp;when much heated, having swallowed a large quantity of&nbsp;iced water. At any rate he died on the 4th September&nbsp;1709.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides the plays noticed above and others, Regnard wrote a certain number of miscellaneous poems, the above-mentioned novel of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La Provençale,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and several short accounts iu prose of his travels.&nbsp;He quarrelled with Boileau and was reconciled with him, owing to&nbsp;which fact the expressions of that critic concerning Reguard’s&nbsp;literary merit were not wholly consistent. The saying, however,&nbsp;which is attributed to him when some one, thinking to curry favour,&nbsp;remarked that Regnard was only a mediocre poet, ‘ ‘ 11 n’est pas&nbsp;médiocrement gai,” is both true and very appropriate. Regnard’s&nbsp;verse is not particularly good (in his non-dramatic work it is sometimes positively bad), and his French style, especially in his purely&nbsp;prose works, is not considered faultless. He is often unoriginal in&nbsp;his plots, and, whether Dufresny was or was not justified in his complaint about </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Joueur,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> it seems likely that Regnard owed not a&nbsp;little to him and to others ; but he had a thorough grasp of comic&nbsp;situation and incident and a most amusing faculty of dialogue. He&nbsp;is often not far from the verge of farce, but he certainly might&nbsp;plead Molière’s example in this respect. There is no trace in him&nbsp;of Molière’s ethical value, and he is seldom a serious critic of society&nbsp;and life, while in point of refinement of incident and language his&nbsp;drama is a distinct relapse from his master’s. But there are few&nbsp;things in artificial comedy more amusing and more dexterously&nbsp;managed than the series of devices whereby the miserly uncle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Légataire Universel</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is brought to make his nephew rich and happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first edition of Regnard’s complete works was published in 1731 (5 vois., Paris), one of the last in 1854 (2 vols.). There is a good selection of almost everything important in the Collection Didot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGNAULT, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Henri </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1843-1871), French painter, born at Paris on the 31st October 1843, was the son of Henri&nbsp;Victor Régnault (noticed below). On leaving school he&nbsp;successively entered the studios of Montfort, Lamothe, and&nbsp;Cabanel, was beaten for the Great Prize (1863) by Layraud&nbsp;and Montchablon, and in 1864 exhibited two portraits in&nbsp;no wise remarkable at the Salon. Nothing, in short,&nbsp;produced by Régnault up to 1866 led men to suspect the&nbsp;brilliancy of his endowments, but in that year he made a&nbsp;mark, carrying off the Great Prize with a work of unusual&nbsp;force and distinction—Thetis bringing the Arms forged by&nbsp;Vulcan to Achilles (School of the Fine Arts). The past&nbsp;and the works of the past in Italy did not touch him, but&nbsp;his illustrations to Wey’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rome</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">show how observant he&nbsp;was of actual life and manners ; even his Automedon&nbsp;(School of Fine Arts), executed in obedience to Academical&nbsp;regulations, was but a lively recollection of a carnival&nbsp;horse race. At Rome, moreover, Régnault came into&nbsp;contact with the modern Hispano-Italian school, a school&nbsp;highly materialistic in its aims and tendencies, and&nbsp;inclined to regard even the human subject only as one&nbsp;amongst many sources whence to obtain amusement for&nbsp;the eye. The vital, if narrow, energy of this school told&nbsp;on Régnault with ever-increasing force during the few&nbsp;remaining years of his life. In 1868 he had sent to the&nbsp;Salon a life-size portrait of a lady in which he had made&nbsp;one of the first attempts to render the actual character of&nbsp;fashionable modern life, and, on his return from a visit to&nbsp;the exhibition, he seized the opportunity of making a tour&nbsp;in Spain. There he saw Prim pass at the head of his&nbsp;troops, and received that lively image of a military&nbsp;demagogue which he afterwards put on canvas somewhat&nbsp;to the displeasure of his subject. But this work made&nbsp;an appeal to the imagination of the public, whilst all the&nbsp;later productions of Régnault were addressed exclusively&nbsp;to the eye. After a further flight to Africa, abridged by&nbsp;the necessities of his position as a pensioner of the school&nbsp;of Rome, he painted Judith, then (1870) Salome, and, as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
