<p><span class="font1">appointed under two statutes of Elizabeth to examine and rectify abuses of charitable bequests has been published by the Record&nbsp;Office. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Forests (Chancery)</span><span class="font1"> contain perambulations and proceedings&nbsp;before the justices in eyre of the forest. The perambulations&nbsp;for certain counties have been printed by G. J. Turner in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select&nbsp;Pleas of the Forest</span><span class="font1"> (Selden Society).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scottish Documents.—</span><span class="font1">Five rolls relating to the policy of Edward I. towards Scotland. The first two contain the proceedings touching&nbsp;the claims to the crown of Scotland and are printed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">vol. ii. p. 762 (Record edition); the remaining three, known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ragman Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> contain in triplicate the submissions of the Scottish&nbsp;nobility to Edward I., and were printed by the Bannatyne Club&nbsp;in 1834. Other chancery documents relating to Scotland are&nbsp;described in J. Bain’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Most of these together with the earlier Forest proceedings are&nbsp;included in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellanea of the Chancery,</span><span class="font1"> which contains numerous&nbsp;other detached documents and rolls. Many of those relating to&nbsp;foreign affairs are printed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery Judicial.—</span><span class="font1">These may be divided into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings, </span><span class="font1">or Bills and Answers, &amp;c., filed by the parties; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decrees and Orders&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the court; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Affidavits</span><span class="font1"> and other documents connected with&nbsp;the course of the action. The series known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Early Chancery&nbsp;Proceedings</span><span class="font1"> (Richard II. to Philip and Mary), comprising documents&nbsp;of all three classes, is arranged roughly in chronological order.&nbsp;The Record Office has published three volumes of a descriptive list&nbsp;(Nos. XII., XVI. and XX.) of the whole of this series; and the first&nbsp;two bundles have been printed in full in the Record Commission’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Proceedings in Chancery, Elizabeth;</span><span class="font1"> other specimens&nbsp;are printed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Pleas of the Chancery</span><span class="font1"> (Selden Society), edited&nbsp;by W. P. Baildon. For the reign of Elizabeth the Proceedings&nbsp;are arranged alphabetically under the plaintiff’s name in two&nbsp;series. Series I. is calendared in the Record Commission volumes&nbsp;already mentioned for Series IL; the Record Office has published a&nbsp;descriptive list (Nos.VII. and VIII.) covering the years 1558-162l. To&nbsp;the Bills and Answers of the reign of Charles II. Messrs Phillimore&nbsp;and Fry have published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index Library</span><span class="font1"> of the British Record&nbsp;Society an index taken from Topham's manuscript index in the&nbsp;Record Office. The same society has reproduced in an alphabetical&nbsp;form an index to the proceedings in Reynardson’s division for the&nbsp;years 1694-1714. These last indexes contain only the surnames&nbsp;of the parties, without reference to the nature of the suit. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decrees&nbsp;and Orders</span><span class="font1"> (36 Henry VIII. to the present time) are the entry-books&nbsp;of the orders of the court; with them may be classed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reports&nbsp;and Certificates</span><span class="font1"> of the masters and chief clerks. The Affidavits, &amp;c.,&nbsp;date from 1611.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chancellor formerly had a common law jurisdiction relating to certain matters touching feudal incidents and tenures, to repeals&nbsp;of letters patent, and to actions upon recognizances acknowledged&nbsp;in chancery or concerning officers of the court. No printed&nbsp;means of referring to these records exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Court of King’s Bench.—The principal records of this court arc the rolls recording its proceedings and judgments, of which&nbsp;classified lists are given in the Record Office List of Plea Rolls&nbsp;(No. IV.), under the following heads. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Curia Regis Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (5 Richard I&nbsp;to 56 Henry III.) include all the rolls of the king's court with the&nbsp;exception of a few </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eyre Rolls.</span><span class="font1"> Of these the Record Commission&nbsp;printed those for 6, 9, 10 Richard I. and 1 John; and also&nbsp;published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreviatio Placitorum</span><span class="font1"> certain abstracts from a&nbsp;portion of the pleas on these rolls made in the 17th century. For&nbsp;specimens see Selden Society volumes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Civil Pleas,</span><span class="font1"> edited by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">W. </span><span class="font1">P. Baildon, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Pleas of the Crown,</span><span class="font1"> edited by F. W.&nbsp;Maitland, who has also edited for the Pipe Roll Society four rolls&nbsp;of the reign of Richard I. From the end of the reign of Henry III.&nbsp;the rolls of the king’s bench and those of the common pleas (see&nbsp;below) have been separated. The former, named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coram Rege&nbsp;Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (1 Edward I. to 13 William III.), divide from 1 Anne into&nbsp;two portions, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> containing pleas between private&nbsp;persons, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crown Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> containing crown business. References&nbsp;to some pleas on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coram Rege Rolls</span><span class="font1"> will be found in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreviatio Placitorum·,</span><span class="font1"> the complete roll for 25 Edward I. has been printed&nbsp;by the British Record Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Assize Rolls, &amp;c.—</span><span class="font1">Under this head are grouped rolls containing the proceedings before justices in eyre, of assize, of oyer and&nbsp;terminer, of gaol delivery (a few) and before justices sent on&nbsp;special commission. References to some of these will be found in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreviatio Placitorum;</span><span class="font1"> and specimens in the Selden Society&nbsp;volumes already mentioned. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eyre Roll</span><span class="font1"> for Gloucestershire,&nbsp;5 Henry III., has been published by F. W. Maitland. The&nbsp;pleadings taken under writs of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quo Warranto</span><span class="font1"> during the period&nbsp;Edward I. to Edward III. were published by the Record Commission. For specimens of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coroners Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (Henry III. to Henry VI.)&nbsp;see the Selden Society’s volume edited by C. Gross. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Baga de&nbsp;Secretis</span><span class="font1"> (since 17 Ed. IV.) contains the proceedings in trials&nbsp;for treason or felony held before the court of king's bench or&nbsp;special commissioners. An inventory and calendar will be found&nbsp;in the 3rd, 4th and 5th reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Court of Common Pleas.—The Plea Rolls of this court, known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Banco Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> run from 1 Edward I., before which date pleas&nbsp;before justices of the common bench form part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Curia Regis</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> to 24 Henry VII., from which date the Plea Rolls are known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Common Rolls.</span><span class="font1"> But in 25 Elizabeth all common recoveries&nbsp;and enrolments of deeds were transferred to a new roll called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recovery Roll,</span><span class="font1"> the series of which extends to 1837. In the Year&nbsp;Books edited for the Rolls Series by L. O. Pike, and those edited&nbsp;for the Selden Society by F. VV. Maitland, the cases reported’ have,&nbsp;when possible, been traced on to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Banco Rolls</span><span class="font1"> and extracts&nbsp;from those rolls printed. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Feet of Fines</span><span class="font1"> (up to 1835) are the official&nbsp;part of the triplicate document constituting the complete fine.&nbsp;Those for the period 7 Richard I. to 16 John have been printed by&nbsp;the Record Commission for the counties Bedfordshire to Dorset&nbsp;in alphabetical order. Four volumes printed for the Pipe Roll&nbsp;Society cover the years down to 10 Richard I. for all counties.&nbsp;The feet of fines are arranged in counties year by year up to the&nbsp;reign of Henry VIII. Afterwards they are arranged term by term&nbsp;in counties. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notes of Fines</span><span class="font1"> (since Edward I.) are the records of&nbsp;an earlier stage in the procedure; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concords of Fines</span><span class="font1"> (since 1559)&nbsp;form another stage; but to neither of these are there printed&nbsp;means of reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Court of Star Chamber.—The relation between the king's council sitting as a judicial body and the Court of Star Chamber set up by the act of 3 Henry VII., c. 1, is matter of controversy.&nbsp;The records of this court are nearly all of later date than this act.&nbsp;They consist of Bills, Answers, Depositions and similar documents,&nbsp;with a very few Decrees and Orders. The Record Office has published a descriptive list (No. XIII.) of a portion of these records;&nbsp; for specimens see Selden Society, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Cases in the Star Chamber,&nbsp;1477-1509,</span><span class="font1"> edited by I. S. Leadam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Court of Requests.—The origin of this court and the manner in which it died out at the time of the Civil War arc alike uncertain.&nbsp;The records that remain are of two kinds, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Books.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Of the former the Record Office has published a descriptive list&nbsp;(No. XXI.) ; and specimens will be found in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Cases in the Court&nbsp;of Requests,</span><span class="font1"> edited for the Selden Society by I. S. Leadam. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Books</span><span class="font1"> contain among other matters the Decrees and Orders of the&nbsp;court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Parliamentary Records.—The proceedings of parliament were recorded either on a roll prepared for each session, or on detached&nbsp;documents and petitions made up into sessional files. The&nbsp;files have now disappeared, although transcripts of some still exist,&nbsp;and in many cases their constituents can be traced among the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Petitions</span><span class="font1"> (see below under Special Collections). The&nbsp;rolls known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parliament Rolls</span><span class="font1"> form a broken series, 18 Edward I.&nbsp;to 48-49 Victoria. The rolls for Edward I. and Edward II. are&nbsp;among the Excheaûer records, and the remainder are in the chancery. Of these rolls and files, and of certain pleadings found in the&nbsp;records of the King’s Remembrancer, the Record Commission&nbsp;published what was meant to be a complete reprint. But the editors&nbsp;relied partly upon transcripts and partly upon original documents,&nbsp;and it is often difficult to determine the sources from which they&nbsp;drew. So prepared, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rolls of Parliament</span><span class="font1"> (6 vols.) cover the&nbsp;period from 6 Edward I. to 1 Mary. The roll for 33 Edward I.,&nbsp;unknown to them, has been edited (Rolls Series, vol. 98) by F. W.&nbsp;Maitland, with a valuable introduction and appendices; rolls&nbsp;for 18 Edward I. and 12 Edward II. are printed in H. Coles' </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Documents Illustrative of English History.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parliament Roll</span><span class="font1"> includes&nbsp;enrolments of statutes among its contents. But from Edward I.&nbsp;to Edward IV. the statutes after receiving the royal assent were&nbsp;also enrolled upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Statute Roll</span><span class="font1"> (chancery), of which only six&nbsp;rolls now remain. From these rolls and other sources the Record&nbsp;Commission prepared the volumes known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Statutes of the Realm&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">on principles described in the introduction to that work. Unfortunately the editors made use of early printed texts, and translations based upon the inferior texts contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exchequer K.R.&nbsp;Miscellaneous Books</span><span class="font1"> 9, 10 and 11, and so diminished the value of&nbsp;their work. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Statutes of the Realm</span><span class="font1"> extend to the end of the reign&nbsp;of Queen Anne. Since then public general acts have been published in many forms; private acts ceased to be enrolled upon&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parliament Rolls</span><span class="font1"> during the 16th century; the originals are&nbsp;preserved in the House of Lords. The Record Office contains&nbsp;detached documents relating to parliamentary proceeding known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exchequer Parliamentary</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery Parliamentary,</span><span class="font1"> but neither&nbsp;class has yet taken a final form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">State Papers.—This class contains the documents belonging to the offices of the secretaries of state, formerly deposited in the place&nbsp;of custody called the State Paper Office. This office was established about the year 1578, but the first attempt to arrange its&nbsp;contents seems to have been due to Sir Thomas Wilson, who in the&nbsp;reign of James I</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font1">divided the papers into two classes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domestic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign,</span><span class="font1"> to which at a later date the dass of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colonial Papers&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font1">added. These series all come to an end at the year 1782, at&nbsp;which date the modem history of the office of Secretary State&nbsp;begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domestic.</span><span class="font1">—Calendars of these papers have been published for the period 1547</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>-</sup>1676, with special volumes dealing with the papers&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Committee for Advance of Money</span><span class="font1"> (1642-1656), and of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Committee for Compounding</span><span class="font1"> (1643-1660). Another series of volumes&nbsp;begins with the year 1689, and a third extends from 1760 to 1775;&nbsp;these last are called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Home Office Papers,</span><span class="font1"> but are in no way different</span></p>
