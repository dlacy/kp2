Here he embraced the Protestant religion, and thus justified in some measure the suspicions of his theological enemies. It has been affirmed by several writers that he carried along with him the royal types, and the moulds in which they were cast ; but it is certain that he never afterwards made use of those types. Besides, is it possible that the author of so daring a theft could have been not only protected in Geneva, but even courted and honoured by the most eminent men of the age ? Is it credible that such a crime could have been concealed for sixty years ; or that Henry, the son and heir of the perpetrator, would have enjoyed the favour of the French king, if Robert Stephanus had acted such a shameful part ? If he was burnt in effigy at Paris, it was not for theft, but for having renounced the popish faith. After his arrival at Geneva, he published an account of the dispute between him and the Paris divines, which does as much honour to his abilities as his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> does to his learning. He died in 1559, after a life of the most extraordinary industry. The books of which he was the editor were not fewer than 360. Many of them were ancient classics in different languages. Several were accompanied with annotations which he collected, and all of them were corrected by the collation of manuscripts. He was so anxious to obtain perfect accuracy, that he used to expose his proofs in public, and reward those who discovered a mistake. His books consequently were very correct. It is said that his New Testament, called <hi rend="italic">O Mirificam</hi> (because the preface begins with these words), has not a single fault. It was Robert Stephanus who first divided the New Testament into verses, during a journey between Paris and Lyon. The advantages of this improvement are fully counterbalanced by its defects. It has destroyed the unity of the books, and induced many commentators to consider every verse as a distinct and independent aphorism. By his last will his estate was left exclusively to such of his children as should settle at Geneva. He left behind hint three sons, Henry, Robert, and Francis.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Stephanus,</hi> the third son of Henry, was, like the rest of his family, familiarly acquainted with the learned languages. This recommenαed him to Lazarus de Baif, who made him tutor to his son, and in 1540 carried him along with him to Germany. He studied medicine, and took his doctor’s degree at Paris. He did not however forsake the profession of his family, but exercised it at Paris, where he became the editor of many books remarkable for neatness and elegance. He wrote above thirty treatises on different subjects, particularly on botany, anatomy, and history. Having been unsuccessful in business, he was imprisoned for debt in the Chatelet in 1561, and died there in 1564.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Stephanus,</hi> the son of Robert the first of that name, did not accompany his father to Geneva, but continued to profess the Romish religion, and to reside at Paris. His letter was remarkably beautiful. He was made king's printer, and died about 1589. His brother Francis, who was also a printer, embraced the Protestant religion, and resided at Geneva.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Stephanus,</hi> the eldest brother, was born at Paris in 1528. He became the most learned and most celebrated of all his family. From a very early age he gave proofs of uncommon abilities, and displayed an ardent passion for knowledge. The Medea of Euripides, which he saw acted while at school, first kindled his love for poetry, and inspired him with the desire of acquiring the language in which that tragedy is written. He entreated his father not to condemn him to study Latin, which he already understood from conversation, but to initiate him at once in the knowledge of Greek. His lather willingly acceded to his request; and Henry applied with such vigour, that in a short time he could repeat the Medea by heart. He afterwards studied Greek under Danesius, who was tutor to the Dauphin, and finally heard the lectures of Tusanus and Turnebus. At an early age he became eager to understand astrology, and accordingly attended a professor of that mysterious art ; but he was not Jong in discovering its absurdity. At the age of nineteen he began his travels, which he undertook in order to examine foreign libraries, and to become acquainted with learned men. He spent two years in Italy, and returned into France completely master of Italian, and bringing along with him copies of several scarce authors, particularly a part ot' Anacreon, which previously was supposed to be lost. He found his father publishing an edition of the New Testament, to which he prefixed some Greek verses. Soon after, he visited England and the Netherlands, where he met with John Clement, an Englishman, to whom he was indebted for the remaining odes of Anacreon. During this journey he learned the Spanish language, which was very much spoken at that time in the Low Countries.</p><p>Whether Henry accompanied his father to Geneva, is uncertain : if he did, he must have returned immediately to France, for we find him soon after established at Paris, and publishing the odes of Anacreon. In 1554 he went to Rome, and thence to Naples. This journey was undertaken at the request, and in the service, of the French government. He was discovered, and would have been arrested as a spy, had he not by his address and skill in the language of the country been able to pass himself for a native of Italy. On his return to France, he assumed the title of printer to Ulric Fugger, a very rich and learned German nobleman, who allowed him a considerable pension.</p><p>In 1560 he married a relation, ns is generally supposed, of Henry Scrimger, a Scotish scholar and civilian, with whom he was intimately acquainted. She was a woman, as he himself informs us, endowed with the noblest spirit and the most amiable disposition. Her death, which happened in 1586, brought on a disease that had twice attacked him before. It was a disgust at all those pursuits which had formerly charmed him, an aversion to reading and the sight of books. It was probably occasioned by too constant and severe an application to literary pursuits. In 1572 he published, in four vols, folio, his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Lingua: Græcæ, </hi>one of the greatest works, perhaps, that ever was executed by one man, if we consider the wretched materials which more ancient dictionaries could furnish, the size and perfection of the work, and the immense labour and learning which must have been employed in the compilation. In 1573, he added <hi rend="italic">Glossaria duo, e situ vetustatis eruta.</hi> This work had been carried on at a greater expense than he could well bear. He expected to be reimbursed by the sale of the book, but he was unfortunately disappointed. Scapula, one of his own correctors, extracted from it whatever he thought would be most serviceable to students, and published it beforehand in quarto. By this act of treachery Henry was reduced to poverty.</p><p>About this time he was much beloved by Henry III. of France, who treated him so kindly, and made him stich flattering promises, that he resided frequently at court. But these promises were never fulfilled, owing to the civil wars which soon after distracted France, and the unfortunate death of Henry himself. During the remainder of his life, his situation was very unsettled. We find him sometimes at Paris, sometimes at Geneva, in Germany, and even in Hungary. He died at Lyon in 1598, at the age of seventy. His temper during the latter part of his life is represented as haughty and severe, owing probably to his disappointments. He was twice married, and by his first wife had a son and two daughters, one of whom was married to the learned Isaac Casaubon.</p><p>This most erudite printer was fond of poetry from his very infancy. It was his practice to compose verses on</p></body></text></TEI>
