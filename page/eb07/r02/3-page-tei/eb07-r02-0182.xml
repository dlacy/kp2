A few years ago this church was destroyed by fire, but it is now rebuilding in a style of great magnificence.</p><p>The church of St. Clements on the slope of the Esquiline has the reputation of being the oldest existing church in the world. The churches of the Jesuits and of St. Ignatius are distinguished for their riches, and the immense number of ornaments which they contain. The church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, built on the site of Pompey’s temple of Minerva, contains the celebrated Christ of Michael Angelo, and in the church of St. Pietro in <hi rend="italic">Vincoli,</hi>  is the famous statue of Moses by the same artist. Many of the churches of Rome are adorned with fine paintings by the greatest masters, but their beauty and colouring has generally suffered much from time, neglect, dirt, and damp. In the church of Santa Maria della Pace are the four Sibyls of Raphael, and the church of the Augustines contains his inimitable fresco of Isaiah. A number of admirable paintings in fresco by Domenichino adorn a chapel in the church of San Liugi de Francesi. The church of the Capuchins possesses Guido’s celebrated painting of the archangel Michael trampling upon Satan. Domenichino’s ecstacy of St. Francis and a fresco of Giotto representing St Peter walking upon the waves, also adorn this church. Daniel da Volterra’s deposition from the cross, which Nicholas Poussin pronounced to be the third picture in the world, once enriched the church of the S. S. Trinité de Monti, but it was totally destroyed by the French in their clumsy attempt to remove it Here is the tomb of Claud Lorraine, and his house stands beside the church ; on the opposite side of the way is the house of Nicholas Poussin, and close by it a house once inhabited by Salvator Rosa. The church of San Andrea della Valle is built upon the spot where tlle curia of Pompey once stood, in which Cæsar fell. It contains some fine paintings in fresco by Domenichino. In the church of Sant' Onofrio the remains of Tasso repose. A number of the churches have been formed out of heathen temples, and it is curious to observe the striking resemblance which the modern Catholic churches bear to the ancient pagan temples in their plan and decoration, pictures, statues, worship of images, holy places, altars, and votive offerings, multiplied ceremonies, and pompous processions.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>There are in Rome</p><p>54 parishes, and 300 churches,</p><p>154 churches served by secular clergy,</p><p>130-by regular clergy (monks,)</p><p>64 monasteries and convents for men,</p><p>50--for women.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p>Nothing strikes a stranger with more admiration on his arrival in Rome than the immense number of fountains which pour forth on every side an inexhaustible supply of the finest water. They shew a great variety in their composition. Some of them are beautiful, one or two grand, but they are all, generally speaking, deficient in simplicity, and several of them, such as the renowned fountain of Trevi, are completely overloaded with mythological sculpture. The water of this fountain, which is the chief supply of modern Rome, is the delicious Aqua Vergine, the same that flowed into Rome in the age of Augustus.</p><p>The streets of Rome are narrow, crooked, badly lighted, and dirty. The best street is the Corso, so named from being used for the course or promenade of carriages at the Ca∏lival. Part of it is the ancient via lata, the rest follows the line of the Via Triumphalis. It is almost the only street that has the merit of being straight, and that can boast of <hi rend="italic">trottoirs</hi>  for foot passengers. It ex</p><lb/><p>tends a mile in length, but is scarcely fifty feet in breadth. This, and all the other parts of the city, consist of buildings from three to five stories in height, built of stone, and plastered over. Every considerable tenement has a bust or portrait of the Virgin stuck upon one corner of it, at the second story, with a lamp in front at night, and an ornamental plaster moulding round it, into which are generally wrought some figures of angels or saints. Rome has no squares, and of the piazzas, the Piazzo del Popolo, and that in front of St Peter's, are the only two that deserve notice. Both are adorned wlth obelisks, statues, and fountains. Gas light is unknown in Rome, and the lamps attached to the shrines of the Virgin were the only street lights until the French came and introduced the “reverberes” used in Paris. Rome contains 500 streets, 275 lanes, 148 places, and 5500 shops.</p><p>Rome has about 335 palaces, or noblemen's houses. Of these, about fifty or sixty are of a superior kind, uniting in their external appearance something of the fortress, the prison, and the palace. Many of the families to which these buildings once belonged have sunk into poverty, and their residences are now turned into ecclesiastical colleges or hotels, or let to foreign ambassadors or consuls. In the others which have escaped this fate, the lower storey is sometimes let for shops, sometimes retained for stables, coach-houses, and servant’s rooms. The second storey is generally a picture gallery, consisting of a suite of rooms all opening into one another, and richly adorned with marble columns and painted ceilings. The owner of the building and of these precious works of art, lives in thc third or highest story, and generously throws open the gallery to artists and to all who choose to give two or three paoli to the servants. The exterior of these palaces is lamentably destitute of architectural beauty, and in the interior, notwithstanding the magnitude of the apartments, and the magnificence of the decorations, they are, generally speaking, exceedingly incommodious and uncomfortable dwellings, and all of them are deficient in cleanliness and order. It is no uncommon thing for an Italian nobleman to reside in the attics of his own palace, and to let the principal apartments to lodgers. Over tlle gates of the palace are the escutcheons of the family, and as if in mockery, the initials S. P. Q. R. (Senatus Populusque Romanus.) The immense palaces of the Doria, the Colonna, and the Borghese, are still occupied only by their own families and dependants. The Doria palace contains the largest collection of paintings in Rome, among which are found some of the finest specimens of the ancient masters. The princely house of Colonna has produced more illustrious men, and can boast a nobler descent, than any in Rome. The gallery of their palace, which is by far the grandest in the city, once contained a number of celebrated paintings, but the finest have been sold. The palace garden, which hangs on tlle steep side of the Quirinal hill, contains the picturesque remains of a magnificent ancient edifice, the name of which is unknown. The palace of the Barberini family formerly contained that celebrated museum of ancient sculpture, vases, gems, medals, &amp;c., which was so long the wonder and admiration of Europe, but it is now sold and dispersed. Thc famous Portland vase was brought from this museum. The palace of tlle Borghese once contained a fine museum of sculpture, and it still possesses the best collection of paintings in Rome. In the Palazzo Mas-sirai is tlle famous Discobalus, the finest in the world, found in the grounds of the Villa Palombari on the Esquiline hill. The Palazzo Spada contains the celebrated statue of Pompey, at the foot of which Cæsar fell. In the palace of the Braschi stands the beautiful colossal statue of Antinous, which was dug up on the site of tlle ancient Gabii.</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  Rome in 19th Century, vol. ii. p. 370.
