Coining home as he did, he had to bear the blame of the&nbsp;attack on the Spanish village, which he had done nothing&nbsp;to avert in his orders to the party going up the river. He&nbsp;was brought before a commission of the privy council.&nbsp;Notes taken of the proceedings have only partially been&nbsp;preserved, but it appears that there was strong evidence&nbsp;that after his failure he had attempted to induce his&nbsp;captains to seize Spanish prizes, or, in other words, to&nbsp;commit what James held to be an act of piracy, though&nbsp;Raleigh, with his views of the rightfulness of fighting&nbsp;Spain in America whatever the Governments in Europe&nbsp;might do, would doubtless have qualified it by another&nbsp;name. At last the commission decided against him, and&nbsp;he was sent to execution formally on his old sentence at&nbsp;Winchester, in reality for having allowed his men to shed&nbsp;Spanish blood after engaging that he would not do so.&nbsp;He was executed on 29th October 1618. His attitude&nbsp;against Spain gave him popularity at a time when the&nbsp;attempt of James to draw’ closer the bonds between Spain&nbsp;and England was repudiated by the great majority of the&nbsp;nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(s. </span><span class="font0">R. </span><span class="font1">G.)</span></p>

R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mosheh Ben Nahman, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Nachman-ides, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">was born before 1200 at Gerona, where he was rabbi and physician, and died between 1268 and 1270 in Pales-tine, probably at Acre. Although a Sepharadi in the later&nbsp;and larger sense of the word, he was the disciple of the&nbsp;greatest Provençal rabbis, and became the most celebrated&nbsp;Talmudist and cabbalist of his age in his own country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMBOUILLET, chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Seine-et-Oise, France, 30 miles southwest of Paris on the line to Brest, is a small place of 5186&nbsp;inhabitants, and derives its whole interest from the associations connected with the ancient chateau, which stands&nbsp;surrounded by a beautiful park of 2965 acres and a wide&nbsp;forest dating from the 14th century. A great machicolated&nbsp;tower and some apartments with good woodwork still&nbsp;remain. The gardens, partly in French, partly in English&nbsp;style, are picturesque, and have an avenue of Louisiana&nbsp;cypress unique in Europe. The park contains the national&nbsp;sheep-farm, where the first flock of merino sheep in France&nbsp;was raised last century. The school of sheep-farming is of&nbsp;recent foundation. Here, too, is the first military school&nbsp;erected for soldiers’ children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Originally a royal domain, the lands of Rambouillet passed in the 14th century to the D’Angennes family, who held them for&nbsp;300 years and built the château. Francis I. died there in 1547 ;&nbsp;and Charles IX. and Catherine de’ Medici found a refuge in the&nbsp;chateau in the wars of religion, as Henry III. did after them.&nbsp;The famous marquise de Rambouillet is separately noticed below.&nbsp;Created a duchy and peerage in favour of the duke of Toulouse,&nbsp;son of Louis XIV., Rambouillet was subsequently bought and embellished by Louis XVI., who erected a model farm, sheep establishment, and other buildings. The place was a hunting-seat of&nbsp;Napoleon I. and Charles X., and it was here that in 1830 the latter&nbsp;signed his abdication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMBOUILLET, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Catherine de Yivonne, Marquise de </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1588-1665), a lady famous in tbe literary history of&nbsp;France, was born in 1588. She was the daughter and&nbsp;heiress of Jean de Yivonne, marquis of Pisani, and her&nbsp;mother Giulia was of the noble Roman family of Savelli.&nbsp;She was married at twelve years old to Charles d’Angennes,&nbsp;vidame of Le Mans, and afterwards marquis of Rambouillet.&nbsp;Her celebrity is due to the salon or literary meeting-place&nbsp;which she established as early as 1608 in the Hôtel de&nbsp;Rambouillet,—or, to give it its proper name, the Hôtel&nbsp;Pisani, for M. de Rambouillet had shortly before his&nbsp;marriage sold his family mansion. Madame de Rambouillet not merely endeavoured to refine the manners of&nbsp;her guests and gave special attention to literary conversation, but also seems to have taken great trouble to arrange&nbsp;her house for purposes of reception, and is said to have&nbsp;been the first to devise suites of rooms through which&nbsp;visitors could move easily. The hôtel was open for more&nbsp;than fifty years, and almost all the more remarkable personages in French society and French literature frequented it,&nbsp;especially during the second quarter of the century, when&nbsp;it was at the height of its reputation. The incidents connected with the salon of the “ incomparable Arthénice ”&nbsp;(an anagram for Catherine which is said to have taken two&nbsp;poets of renown, Malherbe and Racan, a whole afternoon&nbsp;to devise) are innumerable, and it would be impossible to&nbsp;recount them in any space here available. Among the&nbsp;more noteworthy are the sonnet war between the Uranistes&nbsp;and the Jobistes—partisans of two famous sonnets by&nbsp;Voiture and Benserade—and the composition by all the&nbsp;famous poets of the day of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Guirlande de Julie</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, a collection of poems on different flowers, addressed to Julie&nbsp;d’Angennes, Madame de Rambouillet’s eldest daughter.&nbsp;Even more important is the rise of the Précieuses, who&nbsp;owed their existence to Madame de Rambouillet’s salon&nbsp;and influence. These ladies—who are usually represented&nbsp;in the memory of posterity by Molière’s avowed caricatures&nbsp;and by Mademoiselle de Scudéry, but whose name, it must&nbsp;l be remembered, Madame de Sévigné herself was proud to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
