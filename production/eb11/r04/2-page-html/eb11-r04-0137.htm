<p><span class="font2">Cappadocia, Armenia was established as a “ friendly and independent ally.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next in importance to the rectification and defence of the frontiers was the reformation of the administration, and the&nbsp;restoration of prosperity to the distracted and exhausted&nbsp;provinces. The most serious defect of the republican&nbsp;system had been the absence of any effective control&nbsp;over the Roman officials outside Italy. This was&nbsp;now supplied by the general proconsular authority&nbsp;vested in the emperor. The provinces were for the&nbsp;first time treated as departments of a single state, while&nbsp;their governors, from being independent and virtually irresponsible rulers, became the subordinate officials of a higher&nbsp;authority.@@<sup>2</sup> Over the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">legati</span><span class="font2"> of the imperial provinces the&nbsp;control of the emperor was as complete as that of the republican&nbsp;proconsul over his staff in his own province. They were appointed by him, held office at his good pleasure, and were&nbsp;directly responsible to him for their conduct. The proconsuls&nbsp;of the senatorial provinces were in law magistrates equally with&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">princcps,</span><span class="font2"> though inferior to him in rank; it was to the&nbsp;senate that they were as of old responsible; they were still&nbsp;selected by lot from among the senators of consular and&nbsp;praetorian rank. But the distinction did not seriously interfere&nbsp;with the paramount authority of the emperor. The provinces&nbsp;left nominally to the senate were the more peaceful and settled&nbsp;districts in the heart of the empire, where only the routine work&nbsp;of civil administration was needed, and where the local municipal&nbsp;governments were as yet comparatively vigorous. The senatorial proconsuls themselves were indirectly nominated by the&nbsp;emperor through his control of the praetorship and consulship.&nbsp;They wielded no military and only a strictly subordinate&nbsp;financial authority, and, though Augustus and Tiberius, at any&nbsp;rate, encouraged the fiction of the responsibility of the senatorial&nbsp;governors to the senate, it was in reality to the emperor that&nbsp;they looked for direction and advice, and to him that they were&nbsp;held accountable. Moreover, in the case of all governors&nbsp;this accountability became under the empire a reality. Prosecutions for extortion </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(de pecuniis repetundis),</span><span class="font2"> which were now&nbsp;transferred to the hearing of the senate, are tolerably frequent&nbsp;during the first century of the empire; but a more effective&nbsp;check on maladministration lay in the appeal to Caesar from the&nbsp;decisions of any governor, which was open to every provincial,&nbsp;and in the right of petition. Finally, the authority both of the&nbsp;legate and the proconsul was weakened by the presence of the&nbsp;imperial procurator, to whom was entrusted the administration&nbsp;of the fiscal revenues; while both legate and proconsul were&nbsp;deprived of that right of requisitioning supplies which, in spite&nbsp;of a long series of restrictive laws, had been the most powerful&nbsp;instrument of oppression in the hands of republican governors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The financial reforms of Augustus@@<sup>3</sup> are marked by the same desire to establish an equitable, orderly&nbsp;and economical system, and by the same centralization&nbsp;of authority in the emperor’s hands. The institution of an&nbsp;imperial census, or valuation of all land throughout the empire,&nbsp;and the assessment upon this basis of a uniform land tax, in&nbsp;place of the heterogeneous and irregular payments made under&nbsp;the republic, were the work of Augustus, though the system&nbsp;was developed and perfected by the emperors of the 2nd century&nbsp;and by Diocletian. The land tax itself was directly collected,&nbsp;either by imperial officials or by local authorities responsible to&nbsp;them, and the old wasteful plan of selling the privilege of&nbsp;collection to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">publicani</span><span class="font2"> was henceforward applied only to such&nbsp;indirect taxes as the customs duties. The rate of the land tax&nbsp;was fixed by the emperor, and with him rested the power of&nbsp;remission even in senatorial provinces.@@<sup>4</sup> The effect of these&nbsp;reforms is clearly visible in the improved financial condition of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">the empire. Under the republic the treasury had been nearly always in difficulties, and the provinces exhausted and impoverished. Under the emperors, at least throughout the 1st&nbsp;century, in spite of a largely increased expenditure on the&nbsp;army, on public works, on shows and largesses, and on the&nbsp;machinery of government itself, the better emperors, such as&nbsp;Tiberius and Vespasian, were able to accumulate large sums,&nbsp;while the provinces show but few signs of distress. Moreover,&nbsp;while the republic had almost entirely neglected to&nbsp;develop the internal resources of the provinces,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Augustus set the example of a liberal expenditure on public works, in the construction of harbours,&nbsp;roads and bridges, the reclamation of waste lands,&nbsp;and the erection of public buildings.@@<sup>5</sup> The crippling restrictions which the republic had placed on freedom of intercourse and trade, even between the separate districts of a single&nbsp;province, disappeared under the empire. In the eyes of the&nbsp;republican statesmen the provinces were merely the&nbsp;estates of the Roman people, but from the reign of&nbsp;Augustus dates the gradual disappearance of the old&nbsp;pre-eminence of Rome and Italy. It was from the&nbsp;provinces that the legions were increasingly recruited;&nbsp;provincials rose to high rank as soldiers, statesmen and men&nbsp;of letters;@@<sup>6</sup> and the methods of administration, formerly&nbsp;distinctive of the provinces, were adopted even in Rome and&nbsp;Italy. From Augustus himself, jealous as he was of the traditions and privileges of the ruling Roman people, date the rule&nbsp;of an imperial prefect@@<sup>7</sup> in the city of Rome, the division of&nbsp;Italy into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regiones</span><span class="font2"> in the provincial fashion, ’and the permanent&nbsp;quartering there of armed troops.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Augustus founded a dynasty which occupied the throne for more than half a century after his death. The first and by far&nbsp;the ablest of its members was Tiberius </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 14-37).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He was undoubtedly a capable and vigorous ruler, who enforced justice in the government of the provinces, maintained the integrity of the frontiers and husbanded&nbsp;the finances of the empire, but he became intensely unpopular&nbsp;in Roman society, and was painted as a cruel and odious tyrant.&nbsp;His successor, Gaius </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 37-41), generally known as Caligula,&nbsp;was the slave of his wild caprices and uncontrolled passions,&nbsp;which issued in manifest insanity. He was followed by bis&nbsp;uncle, Claudius </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 41-54), whose personal uncouthness made&nbsp;him an object of derision to his contemporaries, but who was&nbsp;by no means devoid of statesmanlike faculties. His reign left&nbsp;an abiding mark on the history of the empire, for he carried&nbsp;forward its development on the lines intended by Augustus.&nbsp;Client-states were absorbed, southern Britain was conquered,&nbsp;the Romanization of the West received a powerful impulse,&nbsp;public works were executed in Rome and Italy, and the organization of the imperial bureaucracy made rapid strides. Nero&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 54-68), the last of the Julio-Claudian line, has been handed&nbsp;down to posterity as the incarnation of monstrous vice and&nbsp;fantastic luxury. But his wild excesses scarcely affected the&nbsp;prosperity of the empire at large; the provinces were well&nbsp;governed, and the war with Parthia led to a compromise in the&nbsp;matter of Armenia which secured peace for half a century.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
