the art of ſuſpending one’s ſelf on water, and at the same time making a progreſſive motion thro’ it.</p><p>As ſwimming is not natural to man, it is evident that at ſome period it must have been unknown among the human race. Nevertheleſs there are. no accounts of its origin to be found in the hiſtory of any nation ; nor are there any nations ſo barbarous but that the art of ſwimming is known among them, and that in greater perfection than among civilized people. It is probable, therefore, that the art, though not abſolutely natural, will always be acquired by people in a ſavage ſtate from imitating the brute animals, moſt of whom ſwim naturally. indeed ſo much does this appear to be the caſe, that very expert ſwimmers have recommended it to thoſe who wiſhed to learn the art, to keep ſome frogs in a tub of water conſtantly beſide them, and to imitate the motions by which they move thro’ that element.</p><p>The theory of ſwimming depends upon one very ſimple principle ; namely, that if a force is applied to any body, it will always move towards that side where there is the leaſt reſiſtance. Thus, if a perſon ſtanding in a boat puſhes with a pole againſt the side or any other part of the vessel in which he ſtands, no motion will enſue; for as much as he presses in one direction with the pole, juſt ſo much does the action of his feet, on which the pressure of the pole muſt ultimately reſt, puſh the vessel the other way : but if, inſtead of the side of the vessel, he puſhes the pole againſt the shore, then only one force acts upon it, namely, that or the feet ; which being resisted only by the fluid water, the boat begins to move from the ſhore. Now the very ſame thing takes place in ſwimming, whether the animal be man, quadruped, bird, or fiſh. If we conſider the matter ſimply, we may ſuppoſe an animal in ſuch a ſituation that it could not poſſibly ſwim : thus, if we cut off the fins and tail of a fiſh, it will indeed float in conſequence of being ſpecifically lighter than the water, but cannot make any progreſſive motion, or at leaſt but very little, in conſequence of wriggling its body; but if we allow it to keep any of its ſins, by ſtriking them againſt the water in any direction, the body moves the contrary way, juſt as a boat moves the contrary way to that in which the oars ſtrike the water. It is true, that as the boat is but partly immerged in the water, the reſiſtance is comparatively leſs than when a frog or even any other quadruped ſwims ; but a boat could certainly be rowed with oars tho’ it was totally immerged in water, only with lels velocity than when it is not. When a man ſwims, he in like manner ſtrikes the water with his hands, arms, and feet ; in conſequence of which the body moves in a direction contrary to the ſtroke. Upon this principle, and on this only, a man may either aſcend, deſcend, or move obliquely, in any poſſible direction in the water. One would think, indeed, that as the ſtrength of a man’s arms and legs is but ſmall, he could make but very little way by any ſtroke he could give the water, conſidering the fluidity of that element. Nevertheleſs it is incredible what expert ſwimmers will perform in this way ; of which Mr Forſter gives a moſt remarkable inſtance in the inhabitants of Otaheite ; whoſe agility, he tells us, was ſuch, that when a nail was thrown overboard, they would jump after it into the ſea, and never fail to catch it before it came to the bottom.</p><p>As to the practice of ſwimming, there are but few directions which can be given. The great obſtacle is the natural dread which people have of being drowned ; and this if is impoſſible to overcome by any thing but accuſtoming ourſelves to go into the vzater. With regard to the real danger of being drowned, it is but little ; and on innumerable occaſions ariſes entirely from the terror above mentioned, as will appear from the following obſervations by Doctor. Franklin.</p><p>“ 1ſt, That though the legs, arms, and head, of a human body, being solid parts, are ſpecifically ſomewhat heavier than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the upper part, from its hollowneſs, is ſo much lighter than water, as that the whole of the body, taken together, is too light to sink wholly under water, but ſome part will remain above until the lungs become filled with water; which happens from drawing water into them inſtead of air, when a perſon in the fright attempts breathing while the mouth and noſtrils are under water.</p><p>“ 2dly, That the legs and arms are ſpecifically lighter than salt water, and will ſhe ſupported by it ; ſo that a human body would not sink in salt water though the lungs were filled as above, but from the greater ſpecific gravity of the head.</p><p>“ 3dly, That therefore a perſon throwing himſelf on his back in salt water, and extending his arms, may eaſily lie<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0251.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0245"/>
ſo as to keep his mouth and noſtrils free for breathing ; and by a ſmall motion of his hands may prevent turning, if he ſhould perceive any tendency to it.</p><p>“ 4thly, That in freſh water, if a man throws himself on his back near the ſurface, he cannot long continue in that ſituation, but by a proper action of his hands on the water. If he uſes no ſuch action, the legs and lower part of the body will gradually ſink till he comes into an upright poſition ; in which he will continue ſuſpended, the hollow of the breaſt keeping the head uppermoſt.</p><p>“ 5thly, But if in this erect poſition the head is kept upright above the ſhoulders, as when we ſtand on the ground, the immerſion will, by the weight of that part of the head that is out of the water, reach above the mouth and noſtrils, perhaps a little above the eyes ; ſo that a man cannot long remain ſuſpended in water with his head in that poſition.</p><p>“ 6thly, The body continued ſuſpended as before, and upright, if the head be leaned quite back, ſo that the face looks upwards, all the back part of the head being then under water, and its weight conſequently in a great meaſure ſupported by it, the face will remain above water quite free for breathing, will riſe an inch higher every inſpiration, and ſink as much every expiration, but never ſo low as that the water may come over the mouth.</p><p>“ 7thly, If therefore a perſon unacquainted with ſwimming, and falling accidentally into the water, could have pretence of mind sufficient to avoid ſtruggling and plunging, and to let the body take this natural poſition, he might continue long ſafe from drowning, till perhaps help would come ; for as to the clothes, their additional weight while immerſed is very inconſiderable, the water ſupporting it ; though when he comes out of the water, he would find them very heavy indeed.”</p><p>The method of learning to ſwim is as follows : The perſon muſt walk into water ſo deep that it will reach to the breaſt. He is then to lie down gently on the belly, keeping the head and neck perfectly upright, the breaſt advancing forward, the thorax inflated, and the back bent then withdrawing the legs from the bottom, and ſtretching them out, ſtrike the arms forwards in uniſon with the legs. Swimming on the back is ſomewhat ſimilar to that on the belly ; but with this difference, that although the legs ∙are employed to move the, body forwards, the arms are generally unemployed, and the progreſſive motion is derived from the movement of the legs. In diving, a perſon muſt dole his hands together, and, preſſing his chin upon his breaſt, make an exertion to bend with force forwards. While in that poſition, he muſt continue to move with rapidity under the ſurface ; and whenever he chooſes to return to his former ſituation, he has nothing to do but bend back his head, and he will immediately return to the ſurface.</p><p>It is very common for novices in the art of ſwimming to make uſe of corks or bladders to aſſiſt in keeping the body above water. Some have utterly condemned the uſe of theſe ; however, Dr Franklin allows that they may be of ſervice for ſupporting the body while one is learning what is called the st <hi rend="italic">roke,</hi> or that manner of drawing in and ſtriking out the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progreſſive motion. “ But (ſays he) you will be no ſwimmer till you can place confidence in the power of the water to ſupport you : I would therefore adviſe the acquiring that confidence in the first place, eſpecially as I have known ſeveral who, by a little of the practice necessary for that purpoſe, have inſenſibly acquired the ſtroke, taught as it were by nature.</p><p>The practice I mean is this : Chooſing a place where the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to your breaſt ; then turn round your face to the ſhore, and throw an egg into; the water, between you and the ſhore ; it will ſink to the bottom, and be eaſily ſeen there, if the water is clear. It muſt lie in the water ſo deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage yourſelf in order to do this, reflect that your progreſs will be from deeper to ſhallower water ; and that at any time you may, by bringing your legs under you, and ſtanding on the bottom, raiſe your head far above the waters then plunge under it with your eyes open, throwing yourſelf towards the egg, and endeavouring, by the action of your hands and feet againſt the water, to get forward till within reach of it. In this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up againſt your inclination ; that it is not ſo easy a thing to ſink as you imagined ; that you cannot but by active force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to ſupport you, and learn to confide in that power ; while your endeavours to overcome it, and to reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands ; which action is afterwards uſed in ſwimming to ſupport your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.”</p><p>As ſwimming is a healthy exerciſe and a pleaſant amuſement, and as a dexterity in it may frequently put it in a man’s power to ſave his own life and the lives of his fellow creatures, perhaps of his deareſt friends, it can neither be uſeleſs nor unintereſting to conſider a few of the evolutions which a ſwimmer muſt be maſter of, that he move in any direction without difficulty, without danger, and without being unneceſſarily fatigued.</p><p>There are ſeveral different ways of turning one’s ſelf in ſwimming. You may do it in this way: Turn the palm of the right hand outwards, extend the arm in the ſame manner, and make a contrary movement with the left hand and left arm ; then, by a gradual motion, incline your head and whole body to the left ſide, and the evolution will be finiſhed. There is another way which is eaſier ſtill : Bend your head and body toward that ſide to which you are going to turn. If you wiſh to turn to the left, incline the thumb and the right hand toward the bottom, bend the fingers of the right hand, ſtretch it out, and uſe it for driving away the water ſidewiſe, or, which is the same thing, for puſhing yourſelf the contrary way. At the ſame time, with your left hand, the fingers being cloſe, puſh the water behind you, and all at once turn your body and your face to the left, and the manoeuvre will be accompliſhed. If you wiſh to turn to the right, you muſt do with your right hand what you did with your left, and with your left what you did with your right. You muſt be careful when turning yourſelf never to ſtretch out your legs, and be ſure that the water be so deep that you be in no danger of hurting yourſelf.</p><p>When you are ſwimming on your belly, and wiſh to turn on your back, draw your feet in quickly, and throw them before you ; ſtretch out your hands behind you, and keep your body firm and ſteady. When you wiſh to turn from ſwimming on your back, fold your feet at once under your body as if you were throwing them to the bottom, and at the ſame instant dart your body forwards, that you may fall upon your belly.</p><p>In swimming, the eyes ought to be turned towards heaven. This is a moſt important rule, and to the neglect of it many of the accidents which befal swimmers are owing. For when they bend their eyes downwards, they inſenſibly bend their head too, and thus the mouth being too deep in the water, may admit a quantity of it in breaking ; beſides, the more the body is ſtretched, it covers a greater part of the ſurface of the water, and conſequently its ſpecific gravity is leſs. Any perſon who will make the experiment will find<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0252.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0246"/>
it impoſſible to dive while he keeps his head erect and his eyes fixed on the heavens<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> An intereſting queſtion occurs here, which deferves to be conſidered. Since the body, when ſpread upon the ſurface, can be ſupported with ſo little exertion, and frequently without any at all, as in ſwimming on the back, how comes it to paſs that a perſon when drowned sinks and frequently riſes again ſome time afterwards ? The reaſon is this : In the act of drowning, the lungs are filled with water, and conſequently the body, being ſpecifically heavier, sinks. It is well known that the human body contains a great quantity of air : this air is at firſt compressed by the water ; and while this is the caſe the body remains at the bottom : but as ſoon as the air by its elaſticity endeavours to diſengage itſelf from the compreſſion, the body is ſwelled and expanded, becomes ſpecifically lighter than the water, and conſequently riſes to the top.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>The eaſieſt poſture in ſwimming is lying on the back. When you wiſh to ſwim in this poſture, lay yourſelf ſoftly on your back, and raiſe your breaſt to the ſurface of the water, keeping your body extended in the ſame line. Put your hands eaſily over the upper part of your thighs, and throw out your legs and draw them in alternately, keeping them within two feet of the ſurface. In this way you may advance in any direction you pleaſe. You may perhaps not like having so much of your head under water ; there is, however, no way of ſwimming ſo eaſy, ſo ſafe, and ſo little fatiguing. If you wiſh to ſwim with great rapidity, you may uſe your arms as well as your feet ; and you will find this the eaſieſt way of breaking the force of the waves.</p><p>In ſwimming on the back, one may advance forward as well as backward. For this purpoſe the body muſt be kept ſtraight and extended ; the breaſt inflated, ſo that the hollow of the back may aſſume a ſemicircular form. The hands muſt recline over the upper parts of the thighs. It is allo necessary to raiſe the legs one after another, and draw them in ſtrongly towards the hams, and then leave them ſuſpended in the water. This way of ſwimming is not only pleaſant, but may ſerve to rest you when fatigued.</p><p>When you are tired with ſwimming on your back and belly, you may ſwim on one side. When you wiſh to do this, sink a little your left side and raiſe your right ; you will immediately find yourſelf on your left side. Move then your left hand without either railing or sinking it ; you have only to ſtretch it and draw it back, as in a ſtraight line, on the ſurface of the water. Independent of the pleasure which this kind of motion will give you, you will have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing both ſides of the river.</p><p>It is poſſible to ſwim on the belly without the aſſiſtance of the hands. For this purpoſe you muſt keep your breaſt erect, your neck ſtraight, and fix your hands behind your head, or upon your back, while you move forward by employing your feet, This way is not without its advantages. It is an excellent reſource when the arms are ſeized with a cramp, or with any indiſposition which makes it painful to exert them. This in ſome caſes may be preferable to ſwimming on the back ; for while in that attitude, one cannot ſee before them without turning every inſtant. If one of your legs be ſeized with a cramp, take hold of it with the hand oppoſite to it, and uſe the other hand and leg to advance or ſupport yourſelf.</p><p>A very ancient and graceful mode of ſwimming, is that of ſwimming with the hands joined. When you wiſh to put this in practice, join your hands, keeping the thumbs and fingers towards heaven, ſo that they may appear above the water ; then draw them back and puſh them forwards alternately from your breaſt. This method of ſwimming may be uſeful in ſeveral circumſtances, but above all if you are entangled with grass or weeds. Your hands will then open a paſſage for you.</p><p>As a perſon may ſometimes have occaſion to carry ſomething in his hand in ſwimming, which he is anxious to preſerve from the water, he may ſwim eaſily with one hand and hold a parcel in the other, as Cæsar ſwam with his Commentaries at Alexandria ; or one may ſwim with both hands elevated. To perform this well, the ſwimmer muſt raiſe his breaſt, and keep it as much inflated as he can, at the ſame time that he ſupports the arms above the water. It muſt not be concealed, that this method of ſwimming is attended with ſome danger to one who is not dexterous at the art ; for if one ſhould imprudently draw in his breaſt, when his arms are raised, he would immediately sink to the bottom.</p><p>Every one knows that when a man plunges into the water, and when he has reached the bottom, he has nothing to do but to give a ſmall ſtroke with his foot againſt the ground, in order to rise ; but an experienced ſwimmer, if he miſſes the ground, has recourſe to another expedient, which is very pretty, and which has not been conſidered with sufficient attention. We ſuppoſe him at a conſiderable depth, when he perceives that he cannot reach the bottom. In ſuch a caſe, he firſts puts his hands before his face, at the height of his forehead, with the palms turned outwardly; then holding the fore part of his arm vertically, he makes them move backwards and forwards from right to left ; that is to ſay, theſe two parts of his arms, having the elbow as a kind of pivot, deſcribe very quickly, both the hands being open, and the fingers joined, two ſmall portions of a circle before the forehead, as if he would make the water retire, which he in fact does ; and from theſe ſtrokes given to the water, there reſults an oblique force, one part of which carries the ſwimmer upwards.</p><p>There are many artificial methods of ſupporting one’s ſelf in water, but we have not room to deſcribe them.— Thoſe who wiſh to ſee a full account of them may conſult the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Methodique.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Swimming</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Fish.</hi> A great proportion of the inhabitants of the waters have an air-bladder, by whieh they poise themſelves.
