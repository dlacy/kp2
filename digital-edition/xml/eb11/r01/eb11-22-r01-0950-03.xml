(Lat. <hi rend="italic">rebus, “</hi> by things ”), a sort of riddle consisting of the representation of some sentence or thing by means of pictures or words, or a combination of both. Rebuses first became popular in France, where they were at first called <hi rend="italic">rébus de Picardie,</hi> that province, according to G. Menage (1613-1692), having been the scene of their origin, which he found in the satires written by the students and young clerks on the foibles of the day under the title “ <hi rend="italic">De rebus quae gerunlur."</hi> Camden mentions an instance of this kind of wit in a gallant who expressed his love to a woman named Rose Hill by painting in the border of his gown a rose, a hill, an eye, a loaf and a well; this, in the style of the rebus, reads “ Rose Hill I love well.’’ This kind of wit was happily ridiculed by Ben Jonson in the humorous description of Abel Drugger’s device in the <hi rend="italic">Alchemist</hi> and by</p><p><hi rend="italic">Publikationen d. Ges. f. Musikforschung,</hi> Berlin, 1883, Bd. xi.</p>
