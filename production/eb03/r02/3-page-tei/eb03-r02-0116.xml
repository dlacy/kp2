By the ſame law, all heads of families were commanded to deliver in upon oath a juſt eſtimate of their effects, and to add to it the places of their abode, whether in town or country. Whoever did not bring in an account of his effects, was to be deprived of his eſtate, to be beat with rods, and publicly ſold for a ſlave. Servius, ſrom theſe particular accounts, which might be pretty well relied on, undertook to eaſe the poor by burdening the rich, and at the ſame time to pleaſe the latter by increaſing their power.</p><p>To this end, he divided the Roman people into ſix claſſes : the firſt claſs conſiſted of thoſe whoſe eſtates and effects amounted to the value of 10,000 drachmae, or 100,000 aſes of braſs; the firſt way of computing being uſed by the Greeks, and the latter by the Latins. This claſs was ſubdivided into 8o centuries, or companies of foot. To theſe Servius joined 18 centuries of Roman knights, who fought on horſeback ; and appointed this conſiderable body of horſemen to be at the head of the firſt claſs, becauſe the eſtates of theſe Xknights, without all doubt, exceeded the ſum neceſſary to be admitted into it. However, the public ſupplied them with horſes ; for which a tax was laid upon widows, who were exempt from all other tributes. This firſt claſs, including infantry and cavalry, conſiſted of 98 centuries. The ſecond claſs comprehended thoſe whoſe eſtates were valued at $700 drachmae, or 75,000 aſes of braſs. It was ſubdivided into 20 centuries, all foot. To theſe were added two centuries of carpenters, ſmiths, and other artificers. In the third claſs were thoſe who were eſteemed worth 5000 drachmae, or 50,000 aſes. This claſs was ſubdivided into 20 centuries. The fourth claſs was of thoſe whoſe effects were rated at the value of 5co drachmæ, or 25,000 aſes, and was divided into 20 centuries ; to which were added two other centuries of trumpets, and blowers of the horn, who ſupplied the whole army with this martial muſic. The fifth claſs included thoſe only whoſe whole ſubſtance did not amount to more than 1250 drachmæ, or 12,500 aſes; and this claſs was divided into 30 centuries. The ſixth claſs comprehended all thoſe who w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere not worth ſo much as thoſe of the fifth claſs : they exceeded in number any other claſs, but nevertheleſs were reckoned but as one century.</p><p>The king drew from theſe regulations all the advantages he had expected. Levies ſor the army were no longer raiſed by tribes, nor were taxes laid at ſa much a head a3 formerly, but all was levied by centuries. When, for inſtance, an army of 20,000 men, or a large ſupply of money, was wanted for the war, each century furniſhed its quota both of men and money r ſo that the firſt claſs, which contained more centuries, though fewer men, than all the others together, furniſhed more men and more money for the public ſervſee than the whole Roman ſtate beſides. And by this means the Roman armies conſiſted for the moil part of the rich citizens of Rome ; who, as they had lands and effects to defend, fought w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ith more reſolution, while their riches enabled them to bear the expence of a campaign. As it was but juſt the king ſhould make the firſtclaſs amends for the weight laid on it,</p><lb/><p>he gave it almoſt the whole authority in ptιblic affairs ; changing the comitia by curiæ, in which every man gave his vote, into comitia by centuries, in which the majority was not reckoned by ſingle perſons, but by Centuries, how few ſoever there might be in a century. Hende the firſt claſs, which contained more centuries than the other five taken together, had every thing at its diſpoſal. The votes of this claſs were firſt taken ; and if the 98 centuries happened to agree, or only 97 of them, the affair was determined ; becauſe theſe made the majority of the 193 centuries which compoſed the ſix claſſes. If they diſagreed, then the ſecond, the third, and the other claſſes in their order, were called to vote, though there was very ſeldom any occaſion to go ſo low as the fourth claſs for a majority of votes ; ſo that by this good order Servius brought the affairs of the ſtate to be determined by the judgment of the moſt conſiderable citizens, who underſtood the public intereſt much better than the blind multitude, liable to be impoſed upon, and eaſily corrupted.</p><p>And now the people being thus divided into ſeveral orders, according to the cenſus or valuation of their eſtates, Servius reſolved to ſolemnize this prudent regulation by ſome public act of religion, that it might be the more reſpected and the more laſting. Accordingly, all the citizens were commanded to appear, on a day appointed, in the Campus Martius, which was a large plain, lying between the city and the Tiber, formerly conſecrated by Romulus to the god Mars. Here the centuries being drawn up in battalia, a ſolemn luſtratiort or expiatory ſacriſice was performed in the name of all the people. The ſacriſice conſiſted of a ſow, a ſheep, and a bull, whence it took the name of <hi rend="italic">ſuove-taurilia.</hi>  The whole ceremony was called <hi rend="italic">lujlrum, à luendo ;</hi>  that is, from paying, expiating, clearing, or perhaps from the goddeſs Lua, who prefided over expiations, and to whom Servius had dedicated a temple. This wiſe king conſidering, that in the ſpace of five years there might be ſuch alterations in the fortunes of private perſons as to entitle ſome to be raiſed to an higher claſs, and reduce others to a lower, enjoined that the cenſus ſhould be renewed every five years. As the cenſus was uſually cloſed by the luſtrum, the Romans henceforth began to compute time by luſtrums, each luſtrum containing the ſpace of five years. However, the luſtrums were not always regularly obſerved, but often put off, though the cenſus had been made in the fifth year. Some writers are of opinion, that Servius at this time coined the firſt money that had ever appeared at Rome ; and add, that the circumſtances of the luſtrum probably led him to ſtamp the figures of the animals there ſlain on pieces of braſs of a certain weight.</p><p>The government of the city being thus eſtabliſhed in ſo regular a manner, Servius, touched with compaſ-fion for thoſe whom the misfortunes of an unſucceſsful war had reduced to ſlavery, thought that ſuch of them as had by long and faithful ſervices deſerved and obtained their feeedom, were much more worthy of being made Roman citizens, than untractable vagabonds from foreign countries, who were admitted without diſtinction. He therefore gave the freedmen their choice, either to return to their own country, or continue at Rome. Thoſe who choſe to continue there, he divided into four tribes, and ſettled them within the city ;</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
