<p><span class="font1">Another moſt important fact was alſo the reſult of his obſervation, viz. that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the mean velocity in any pipe or&nbsp;openflream is the arithmetical mean between the velocity in&nbsp;the axis and the velocity at the ltdes of a pipe or bottom&nbsp;of an open flream.</span><span class="font1"> We have already obſerved, that the&nbsp;ratio of the velocity in the axis to the velocity at the&nbsp;bottom diminiſhed as the mean velocity increaſed. This&nbsp;variation he was enabled to expreſs in a very ſimple&nbsp;manner, ſo as to be eaſily remembered, and to enable&nbsp;us to tell any one of them by obſerving another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">If we take unity from the ſquare root of the ſuperficial velocity, expreſſed in inches, the ſquare of the remainder is the velocity at the bottom ; and the mean velocity is the half ſum of theſe two.</span><span class="font1"> Thus, if the velocity in the&nbsp;middle of the ſtream be 25 inches per ſecond, its ſquare&nbsp;root is five ; from which if we take unity, there remains&nbsp;four. The ſquare of this, or · 16, is the velocity at</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is a very curious and moſt uſeful piece of information. The velocity in the middle of the ſtream is the eaſieſt meaſured of all, by<sup>4</sup>any light ſmall body&nbsp;floating down it ; and the mean velocity is the one&nbsp;which regulates the train, the diſcharge, the effect on&nbsp;machines, and all the moſt important conſequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may expreſs this by a formula of moſt eaſy recollection. Let V be the mean velocity, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font1"> the velocity in the axis, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font1"> the velocity at the bottom ; we</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Alſo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font0"> = (√v —4 + i)∖ and &lt;y = (√~ + ι)±. V=(√⅛⅝ andV= (√<sub>a</sub>+l)<sup>4</sup>+ι.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">√V-√ = that is, the difference between theſe velocities increaſes in the ratio of the ſquare roots of the mean velocities diminiſhed by a ſmall conſtant quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This may perhaps give the mathematicians ſome help in aſcertaining the law ol degradation from the axis&nbsp;to the ſides. Thus, in a cylindrical pipe, we may conceive the current as conſiſting of an infinite number of&nbsp;cylindrical ſhells Aiding within each other like the draw&nbsp;tubes of a ſpy-glaſs. Each of theſe is in equilibrio, or&nbsp;as much accelerated by the one within it as it is retarded by the one without ; therefore as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">momentum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of each diminiſhes in the proportion of its diameter&nbsp;(the thickneſs being ſuppoſed the ſame in all), the ve-locitv of ſeparation muſt increaſe by a certain law from&nbsp;the ſides to the axis. The magnitude of the ſmall conſtant quantity here ſpoken of ſeems to fix this law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The place of the mean velocity could not be diſcovered with any preciſion. In moderate velocities it was not more than one-fourth or one-fifth of the depth&nbsp;diſtant from the bottom. In very great velocities it&nbsp;was ſenſibly higher, but never in the middle of the&nbsp;depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The knowledge of theſe three velocities is of great importance. The ſuperſlcial velocity is eaſily obſerved;&nbsp;hence the mean velocity is eaſily computed. This multiplied by the ſection gives the expence ; and if we alſo&nbsp;. meaſure the expanded border, and then obtain the mean&nbsp;depth (or ), we can, by the formula of uniform motion, deduce the ſlope ; or, knowing the ſlope, we can.&nbsp;deduce any of the other circumſtances.</span></p><h5><span class="font2">The following table of theſe three velocities will ſave the trouble of calculation in one of the moſt frequent-·,&nbsp;queſtions of hydrauliç».</span></h5>
