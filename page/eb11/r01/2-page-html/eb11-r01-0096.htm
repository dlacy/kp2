<p><span class="font2">opened was much less in proportion to the mileage sanctioned in the cases of lines constructed on their own land than in the&nbsp;case of lines more of the nature of tramways. (In other&nbsp;countries where the mileage of main lines of railways in pro-portion to area and population is roughly the same as in the&nbsp;United Kingdom, the mileage of light railways already constructed is considerable, while many additional lines are under&nbsp;construction. At the end of 1903 there were 6150 m. working&nbsp;in France, costing on an average £4500 per mile, earning £275&nbsp;per mile per annum; 3730 miles in Prussia costing £4180 per&nbsp;mile, earning £310 per mile per annum; 1430 m. in Belgium&nbsp;at £3400 per mile, earning £320 per mile per annum. ) The&nbsp;average cost per mile in Great Britain on the basis of the&nbsp;prescribed estimates is £5860, but this figure does not include&nbsp;the cost of equipment and does not cover the whole cost of&nbsp;construction. According to the light railway commissioners,&nbsp;experience satisfied them </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> that light railways were much&nbsp;needed in many parts of the country and that many of the lines&nbsp;proposed, but not constructed, were in fact necessary to admit&nbsp;of the progress, and even the maintenance, of existing trade&nbsp;interests; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font2"> that improved means of access were requisite&nbsp;to assist in retaining the population on the land, to counteract&nbsp;the remoteness of rural districts, and also, in the neighbourhood&nbsp;of industrial centres, to cope with the difficulties as to housing&nbsp;and the supply of labour. They pointed out that while during&nbsp;the first five years the act was in force there were 315 applications for orders, during the second five years there were only&nbsp;142 applications, and that proposals for new lines had become&nbsp;less numerous owing to the various difficulties in carrying&nbsp;them to a successful completion and to the difficulty of raising&nbsp;the necessary capital even when part of it was provided with&nbsp;the aid of the state and of the local authorities. They ex-pressed the opinion that an improvement could be effected&nbsp;enabling the construction of many much-needed lines by an&nbsp;amendment of some of the provisions of the Light Railways&nbsp;Act, and by a reconsideration of the conditions under which&nbsp;financial or other assistance should be granted to such lines by&nbsp;the state and by local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The so-called light railways in the United States and the British colonies have been made under the conditions peculiar&nbsp;to new countries. Their primary object being the development&nbsp;and peopling of the land, they have naturally been made as&nbsp;cheaply as possible; and as in such cases the cost of the land is&nbsp;inconsiderable, economy has been sought by the use of lighter&nbsp;and rougher permanent way, plant, rolling stock, &amp;c. Such&nbsp;railways are not “ light ’’ in the technical sense of having been&nbsp;made under enactments intended to secure permanent lowness&nbsp;of cost as compared with standard lines. On the continent&nbsp;of Europe many countries have encouraged railways which are&nbsp;light in that sense. France began to move in this direction&nbsp;in 1865, and has formulated elaborate provisions for their&nbsp;construction and regulation. Italy did the same in its laws&nbsp;in 1873, 1879, 1881, 1887 and 1889; and Germany fostered&nbsp;enterprise of this kind by the imperial edicts of 1875, 1878&nbsp;and 1892. Holland, Hungary and Switzerland were all early&nbsp;in the field; and Belgium has succeeded, through the in-strumentality of the semi-official Société Nationale de Chemins&nbsp;de Fer Vicinaux, started in 1885, in developing one of the most&nbsp;complete systems of rural railway transport in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In France the lines which best correspond to British light railways are called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chemins de fer d'intérêt local.</span><span class="font1"> These are regulated by&nbsp;a decree No. 11, 264 of 6th August 1881, which the&nbsp;Ministry of Public Works is charged to carry out. The&nbsp;model “ form of regulation ” lays down the scales of the drawings&nbsp;and the information to be shown thereon. For the first installation&nbsp;a single line is prescribed, but the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concessionaire</span><span class="font1"> must provide&nbsp;space and be prepared to double when required. The gauge may be&nbsp;either 1∙44 metres (4 ft. 8∙7 in. ), or 1 metre (3 ft. 3∙37 in. ), or ∙75&nbsp;metre (2 ft. 5∙5 in. ). The radius of curves for the 1∙44 m. gauge&nbsp;must not be less than 250 metres, 100 metres for the 1 m. gauge&nbsp;and 50 metres for the ∙75 m. gauge. A straight length of not less&nbsp;than 60 metres for the largest gauge and 40 metres for the smallest&nbsp;must be made between two curves having opposite directions.&nbsp;Except in special cases, gradients must not exceed 3 in 100; and&nbsp;between gradients in the opposite sense there must be not less than&nbsp;60 metres of level for 1∙44 m. and 40 metres for 1 m. and ∙75 m.&nbsp;gauges. The position of stations and stopping-places is regulated&nbsp;by the council of the department. The undertaking, once approved,&nbsp;is regarded as a work of public utility, and the undertakers are&nbsp;invested with all the rights that a public department would have&nbsp;in the case of the carrying out of public works. At the end of the&nbsp;period of the concession the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">department</span><span class="font1"> comes into possession of&nbsp;the road and all its fixed appurtenances, and in the last five years&nbsp;of the period the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">department</span><span class="font1"> has the right to enter into possession&nbsp;of the line, and apply the revenue to putting it into a thorough&nbsp;state of repair. It has also the right to purchase the under-taking at the end of the first fifteen years, the net profits of the&nbsp;preceding seven years to govern the calculation of the purchase&nbsp;price. The maximum 1st, 2nd and 3rd class passenger fares are,&nbsp;per kilometre, ∙o67 f. (∙6d. ), ·050 f. (∙455d. ) and ·037 f. (·34d. )&nbsp;respectively, when the trains are run at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grande vitesse,</span><span class="font1"> the fares&nbsp;including 30 kilogrammes weight of personal baggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Belgium a public company under government control (“ Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer Vicinaux ”) does all that in France&nbsp;forms the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior&nbsp;and of the prefect of the department. Over an average&nbsp;of years it appears that 27% of the capital cost was found by&nbsp;the state, 28% by the province, 40∙9 % by the communes and&nbsp;4∙1% by private individuals. At the end of 1908 there were&nbsp;2085 m. in operation, and the total mileage authorized was 2603,&nbsp;while the construction of a considerable further mileage was under&nbsp;consideration. As far as possible, these railways are laid beside&nbsp;roads, in preference to independent formation; the permanent&nbsp;way costs £977 per mile in the former as against £793 in the latter.&nbsp;If laid in paving, the price varies between £1108 and £2266 per&nbsp;mile. Through villages, and where roads have to be crossed, the&nbsp;line is of the usual tramway type. The line is of </span><span class="font0">I </span><span class="font1">metre gauge,&nbsp;with steel rails weighing 21½ kilos (42 ℔) per yard, In the towns&nbsp;a deeper rail is used, weighing about 60 ℔ per yard. In three lines&nbsp;of the Vicinaux system, in the aggregate 45 m. in length, the&nbsp;sharpest curves are 30 metres, 35 metres and 40 metres respectively.&nbsp;There are gradients of 1 in 20 and 1 in 25. The speed is limited&nbsp;to 30 kilometres (about 18 m. ) in the country and 6 m. per hour in&nbsp;towns and through villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Italy many railways which otherwise fulfil the conditions of a light railway are constructed with a gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in. The&nbsp;weights are governed by what the railway has to carry&nbsp;and the speed. Light locomotives, light rails and light&nbsp;rolling stock are employed. There are no bridges, except where&nbsp;watercourses occur. Cuttings are reduced to a minimum; and&nbsp;where the roads are sufficiently wide, the rails are laid on the&nbsp;margins. The advantage of uniformity of gauge is in the use of&nbsp;trucks for goods which belong to the rolling stock of the main lines.&nbsp;In Italy these railways are called “ economic railways, ” and are&nbsp;divided into five types. Types I., II. and III. are of 4 ft. 8½ in.&nbsp;gauge, type IV. of 0·95 m. and type V. of 0·70 m.; but as there&nbsp;is no example of type V., the classification is practically one of&nbsp;1∙445 m. (4 ft. 8½ in. ) and one of 0·95 (3 ft. 0∙5 in. ). The chief&nbsp;difference between the first three types lies in the weight of rails&nbsp;and rolling stock and in the radius of the curves. The real light&nbsp;railway of Italy is that of type IV.: gauge, 0·95 m. (3 ft. 0·5 in. );&nbsp;weight of rails, 12 (26∙45 ℔) to 20 (44 ℔) kilos; mean load per&nbsp;axle, 6 tons; minimum curve, 70 m. (229 ft. 2∙6 in. ) radius; width&nbsp;of formation, 3∙50 m. (11 ft. 5∙5 in. ); top width of ballast, 2·10 m.&nbsp;(6 ft. 10∙7 in. ); depth of ballast under sleepers, 0∙10 m. (3 ft. 9∙5 in. );&nbsp;maximum gradient, </span><span class="font0">I </span><span class="font1">in 50; length of sleepers, 1∙70 m. (5 ft. 6∙92 in. );&nbsp;width between parapets and width of tunnels, 1 m. over width of&nbsp;carriage; height of tunnels, 5 m. (16 ft. 4·85 in. ); locomotives,&nbsp;maximum weight per axle 6 tons, rigid wheel base 1∙80 m. (5 ft.&nbsp;10∙86 in. ), diameter of driving-wheels 1 m. (3 ft. 3∙37 in. ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Germany the use of light railways </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Klein-bahnen)</span><span class="font1"> has made great strides. The gauges in use vary considerably between 4 ft.&nbsp;8½ in., the standard national gauge, and 1 ft. 11¾ in.,&nbsp;which appears to be the smallest in use. They are under&nbsp;the control of the Post and Telegraph department, the state issuing&nbsp;loans to encourage the undertakings; the authorities in the provinces&nbsp;and communes also give support in various ways, and under various&nbsp;conditions, to public bodies or private persons who desire to promote&nbsp;or embark in the industry. These conditions, as well as the degree&nbsp;of control over the construction and working of the lines, are left&nbsp;to the regulation of the provincial governments. Similarly, the&nbsp;same authorities decide for themselves the conditions under which&nbsp;the public roads may be used, and the precautions for public safety,&nbsp;all subject to the confirmation of the imperial government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What are known as “ portable railways ” should be included in the same category as light railways. With a 24 in. gauge,&nbsp;lines of a portable kind can be made very handily and&nbsp;the cost is very much less than that of a permanently&nbsp;constructed light railway. The simplicity is great;&nbsp;they can be quickly mounted and dismounted; the correct&nbsp;gauge can be perfectly maintained; the sections of rails and</span></p>
