               <p>                   <label>ROSSELLINO, ANTONIO</label> (1427-c. 1479), Florentine sculptor, was the
                    son of Matteo di Domenico Gamberclli, and had four brothers, who all practised
                    some branch of the fine arts. Almost nothing is known about the life of Antonio,
                    but many of his works exist, and are full of religious sentiment, and executed
                    with the utmost delicacy of touch and technical skill. The style of Antonio and
                    his brother Bernardo is a development of that of Donatello and Ghiberti; it
                    possesses all the refinement and sweetness of the earlier masters, but is not
                    equal to them in vigour or originality. Antonio’s chief work, still in perfect
                    preservation, is the lovely tomb of a young cardinal prince of Portugal, who
                    died in 1459. It occupies one side of a small chapel, also built by Rossellino,
                    on the north of the nave of San Miniato al Monte. <note anchored="true"

                        xxiii. </note> The recumbent effigy of the cardinal rests on a handsome
                    sarcophagus, and over it, under the arch which frames the whole, is a beautiful
                    relief of the Madonna between two flying angels. The tomb was begun in 146T and
                    finished in 1466; Antonio received four hundred and twenty-five gold florins for
                    it. A reproduction of this tomb with slight</p>               <p>alterations, and of course a different effigy, was made by Antonio for the wife
                    of Antonio Piccolomini, duke of Amalfi, in the church of S. Maria del Monte at
                    Naples, where it still exists. For the same church he also executed some
                    delicate reliefs, which perhaps err in being too pictorial in style, especially
                    in the treatment of the backgrounds. A fine medallion relief by him in marble,
                    originally modelled in terra-cotta, is preserved in the Bargello at Florence
                    (see fig.).</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernardo Rossellino</hi> (1409-1464), Florentine sculptor,
                    was no less able than his younger brother Antonio. I?is finest piece of
                    sculpture is the tomb, in the Florentine Santa Croce, of Leonardo Bruni of
                    Arezzo, the historian of Florence, executed in 1443 some years after Bruni’s
                    death; the recumbent effigy is of great merit. The inner cathedral pulpit at
                    Prato, circular in form on a tall slender stem, was partly the work of Mino da
                    Fiesole and partly by Bernardo Rossellino. The latter executed the minute
                    reliefs of St Stephen and the Assumption of the Virgin. For his part in the work
                    he received sixty-six gold florins. The South Kensington Museum possesses a
                    relief by Bernardo, signed and dated (1456). It is a fine portrait of the
                    physician Giovanni da S. Miniato. Bernardo’s works as an architect were numerous
                    and important, and he was also a skilful military engineer. He restored the
                    church of S. Francis at Assisi, and designed several fine buildings at Civita
                    Vecchia, Orvieto and elsewhere. He also built fortresses and city walls at
                    Spoleto, Orvieto and Civita Castellana. He was largely employed by Nicholas V.
                    and Pius II. for restorations in nearly all the great basilicas of Rome, but
                    little trace of his work remains, owing to the sweeping alterations made during
                    the 17th and 18th centuries. Between the years i46r and 1464 (when he died while
                    engaged on the Lazzari monument at Pistoia) he occupied the important post of
                        <hi rend="italic">capo-maestro</hi> to the Florentine duomo. A number of
                    buildings at Pienza, executed for Pius II., are attributed to him; the Vatican
                    registers mention the architect of these as M° Bernardo di Fiorenza, but this
                    indication is too slight to make it certain that the elder Rossellino is
                    referred to (see Vasari, ed. Milanesi, iii. 93 seq.).</p>               <p>See Wilhelm Bode, <hi rend="italic">Die Italienische Plastik</hi> (Berlin,
