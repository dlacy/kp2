<p><span class="font0">became a wanderer in Italy. In August 1414 Ladislaus died, and was succeeded by the scandalous Queen Joanna II. The&nbsp;Roman people promptly expelled the Neapolitans, and Cardinal&nbsp;Isolani, John’s legate, succeeding in rousing a reaction in favour&nbsp;of the church, constituted a government of thirteen “ conservators” on the 19th of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In November 1414 the council of Constance assembled, and at last ended the schism by deposing all the popes&nbsp;and incarcerating John XXIII., the most turbulent&nbsp;of the three. On the nth of November 1417 Oddo&nbsp;Colonna was unanimously elected to the papal chair;&nbsp;he was consecrated in the cathedral on the 27th as&nbsp;Pope Martin V., and, being acknowledged by all,&nbsp;hastened without delay to take possession of his see. Meanwhile disorder was at its height in Rome. The cardinal legate&nbsp;Isolani governed as he best could, while the castle&nbsp;of St Angelo remained in the hands of the Neapolitans, who still had a party in the city. In&nbsp;this divided state of affairs, Braccio, a daring captain of&nbsp;adventurers, nicknamed Fortebraccio, was inspired with the&nbsp;idea of making himself master of Rome. Overcoming the feeble&nbsp;resistance opposed to him, he succeeded in this on the 16th&nbsp;of June 1416, and assumed the title of “ Defensor Urbis.”&nbsp;But Joanna of Naples despatched Sforza, an equally valiant&nbsp;captain, against him, and, without offering battle, Fortebraccio&nbsp;withdrew on the 26th of August, after having been absolute&nbsp;master of the Eternal City for seventy days. Sforza marched&nbsp;in on the 27th and took possession of the city in the name of&nbsp;Joanna. Martin V. instantly proved himself a good statesman. He confirmed the legate Isolani as his vicar and&nbsp;Giovanni Savelli as senator. Leaving Constance on the 16th of&nbsp;May 1418, he reached Milan on the 12th of October, and slowly&nbsp;proceeded on his journey. While in Florence he despatched&nbsp;his brother and nephew to Naples to make alliance with Joanna,&nbsp;and caused her to be crowned on the 28th of October 1419 by&nbsp;his legate Morosini. Upon this she promised to give up Rome&nbsp;to the pope. Her general, Sforza, then entered the service of&nbsp;Martin V., and compelled Fortebraccio, who was lingering in&nbsp;a threatening attitude at Perugia, to make peace with the&nbsp;pope. The latter entrusted Fortebraccio with the conduct&nbsp;of the campaign against Bologna, and that city was reduced&nbsp;to submission on the 15th of July 1420. The Romans had&nbsp;already yielded to Martin’s brother the legate, and now&nbsp;earnestly besought the arrival of their pope. Accordingly,&nbsp;he left Florence on the 19th of September 1420, and entered the&nbsp;Vatican on the 28th. Rome was in ruins; nobility and burghers&nbsp;were equally disorganized, the people unable to bear arms and&nbsp;careless of their rights, while the battered walls of the Capitol</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">recorded the fall of two republics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Martin V. had now to fulfil a far more difficult task than that of taking possession of Rome. Throughout Italy municipal&nbsp;freedom was overthrown, and the Roman Republic&nbsp;had ceased to exist. The Middle Ages were ended;&nbsp;the Renaissance was beginning. The universal unity&nbsp;both of church and of empire was dissolved; the&nbsp;empire was now’ Germanic, and derived its principal strength&nbsp;from direct dominion over a few provinces. Independent&nbsp;and national states were already formed or forming on all sides.&nbsp;The papacy itself had ceased to claim universal supremacy&nbsp;over the world’s governments, and the possession of a temporal&nbsp;state had become essential to its existence. In fact, Martin V.&nbsp;was the first of the series of popes who were real sovereigns,&nbsp;and more occupied with politics than religion. Involved in&nbsp;all the foreign intrigues, falsehoods and treacheries of Italian&nbsp;diplomacy in the 15th century, their internal policy was imbued&nbsp;with all the arts practised by the tyrants of the Renaissance,&nbsp;and nepotism became necessarily the basis of their strength.&nbsp;It was natural that men suddenly elected sovereigns of a new&nbsp;country where they had no ties, and of which they had often&nbsp;no knowledge, should seek to strengthen their position by&nbsp;aggrandizing so-called nephews who were not unfrequently</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">their sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Martin V. reduced the remains of the free Roman government to a mere civil municipality. Following the method of the other despots of Italy, the old republican&nbsp;institutions were allowed to retain their names&nbsp;and forms, their administrative and some of their&nbsp;judicial attributes, while all their political functions&nbsp;were transferred to the new government. Order&nbsp;was re-established, and justice rigidly observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many rebellious places were subdued by the sword, and many leaders of armed bands were hanged. The&nbsp;pope, however, was forced to lean on his kinsmen the&nbsp;Colonna and again raise them to power by grants of&nbsp;vast fiefs both in his own state and the Neapolitan territory.&nbsp;And, after first supporting Joanna II., who had assisted his&nbsp;entry into Rome, he next sided with her adversary, Louis of&nbsp;Anjou, and then with Alphonso of Aragon, the conqueror of&nbsp;both and the constant friend of the pope, who at last felt safe&nbsp;on his throne. Rome now enjoyed order, peace and security,&nbsp;but had lost all hope of liberty. And when Martin died&nbsp;(20th February 1431) these words were inscribed on his tomb,&nbsp;“ Temporum suorum felicitas. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Eugenius IV. (1431-47) leant on the Orsini, and was fiercely opposed by the Colonna, who excited the people against him.&nbsp;Accordingly on the 29th of May T434 the Romans rose&nbsp;in revolt to the old cry of “ Popolo e popolo, ” and&nbsp;again constituted the rule of the seven governors&nbsp;of liberty. The pope fled by boat down the Tiber,&nbsp;and, being pursued with stones and shots, narrowly escaped&nbsp;with his life. On reaching Florence, he turned his energies&nbsp;to the recovery of the state. It was necessary to quell&nbsp;the people; but, first of all, the Colonna and the clan of the&nbsp;prefects of Vico, with their renewed princely power, had to&nbsp;be overthrown. The Orsini were still his friends. Eugenius&nbsp;entrusted the campaign to Patriarch (afterwards Cardinal)&nbsp;Vitelleschi, a worthy successor of Albomoz, and of greater&nbsp;ferocity if less talent. This leader marched his army towards&nbsp;Rome, and, instantly attacking Giovanni, prefect of Vico,&nbsp;captured and beheaded him. The family was now extinguished;&nbsp;and its possessions reverting to the church, the greater part of&nbsp;them were sold or given to Count Everso d’Anguillara, of the&nbsp;house of Orsini. The prefecture, now little more than an&nbsp;honorary title, was bestowed at will by the popes. Eugenius&nbsp;gave it to Francesco,’founder of the powerful line of the Gravina-Orsini. Thus one noble family was raised to greatness w</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">hil</span><span class="font0">e&nbsp;another perished by the sword. Vitelleschi had already begun&nbsp;to persecute the Colonna and the Savelli, and committed terrible&nbsp;slaughter among them. Many castles were demolished, many&nbsp;towns destroyed; and their inhabitants, driven to wander&nbsp;famine-stricken over the Campagna, had to sell themselves as&nbsp;slaves for the sake of bread. Finally the arrogant patriarch&nbsp;marched into Rome, as into a conquered city, at the head of&nbsp;his men, and the Romans crouched at his feet. The pope now&nbsp;began to distrust him, and sent Scarampo, another prelate&nbsp;of the same stamp, to take his place. This new commander soon arrived, and, perceiving that Vitelleschi&nbsp;proposed to resist, had him surrounded by his soldiers,&nbsp;who were obliged to use force to compel his surrender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vitelleschi was carried bleeding to the castle of St Angelo, where he soon afterwards died. The pope&nbsp;at last returned to Rome in 1443, and remained there quietly&nbsp;till his death in 1447.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His successor Nicholas V. (1447-55) was a scholar solely devoted to the patronage of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">literati</span><span class="font0"> and artists. During his&nbsp;reign there was a fresh attempt to restore the republic, but it&nbsp;was rather prompted by literary and classical enthusiasm&nbsp;than by any genuine patriotic ardour. Political passions&nbsp;and interests had ceased to exist. The conspiracy&nbsp;was headed by Stefano Porcari, a man of the people,&nbsp;who claimed to be descended from Cato. He had&nbsp;once been captain of the people in Florence, and was&nbsp;made podestà of Bologna by Eugenius ' IV. He was a&nbsp;caricature of Cola di Rienzi, and extravagantly proud of his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
