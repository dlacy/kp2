<p><span class="font1">RITSCHL, Friedrich Wilhelm (1806-1876), an eminent German scholar, was born in 1806 in Thuringia.&nbsp;His family, in which culture and poverty were hereditary,&nbsp;were Protestants who had immigrated several generations&nbsp;earlier from Bohemia. Ritschl was fortunate in his school&nbsp;training, at a time when the great reform in the higher&nbsp;schools of Prussia had not yet been thoroughly carried&nbsp;out. His chief teacher, Spitzner, a pupil of Gottfried&nbsp;Hermann, divined the boy’s genius and allowed it free&nbsp;growth, applying only so much either of stimulus or of&nbsp;restraint as was absolutely needful. After a wasted year&nbsp;at the university of Leipsic, where Hermann stood at the&nbsp;zenith of his fame, Ritschl passed in 1826 to Halle. Here&nbsp;he came under the powerful influence of Reisig, a young&nbsp;“ Hermannianer ” with exceptional talent, a fascinating&nbsp;personality, and a rare gift for instilling into his pupils&nbsp;his own ardour for classical study. The great controversy&nbsp;between the “Realists” and the “Verbalists” was then&nbsp;at its height, and Ritschl naturally sided with Hermann&nbsp;against Boeckh. The early death of Reisig in 1828 did&nbsp;not sever Ritschl from Halle, where he brilliantly attained&nbsp;the doctorate, and in 1829 became privat-docent, in 1832&nbsp;an extraordinary professor. He began his professorial&nbsp;career with a great reputation and brilliant success, but&nbsp;soon hearers fell away, and the pinch of poverty compelled&nbsp;his removal to Breslau, where he reached the rank of&nbsp;“ ordinary ” professor in 1834, and held other offices. The&nbsp;great event of RitschΓs life was a sojourn of nearly a year&nbsp;in Italy (1836-37), spent in libraries and museums, and&nbsp;more particularly in the laborious examination of the&nbsp;Ambrosian palimpsest of Plautus at Milan. From this&nbsp;journey Ritschl’s whole temperament and intellect received&nbsp;a new and richer colouring, and the remainder of his life&nbsp;was largely occupied in working out the material then&nbsp;gathered and the ideas then conceived. Bonn, whither he&nbsp;removed on his marriage in 1839, and where he remained&nbsp;for twenty-six years, was the great scene of his activity&nbsp;both as scholar and as teacher. The philological seminary&nbsp;which he controlled, although nominally only joint director&nbsp;with Weicker, became a veritable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">officina litterαrum,</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;kind of Isocratean school of classical study ; in it were&nbsp;trained many of the foremost scholars of the last forty&nbsp;years. The names of Georg Curtius, Ihne, Schleicher,&nbsp;Bernays, Ribbeck, Lorenz, Vahlen, Hübner, Bücheier, Hel-big, Benndorf, Riese, Windisch, Brugmann, who were his&nbsp;pupils either at Bonn or at Leipsic, attest his fame and&nbsp;power as a teacher. In 1854 Otto Jahn took the place&nbsp;of the venerable Weicker at Bonn, and after a time succeeded in dividing with Ritschl the empire over the philological school there. The two had been friends, but after&nbsp;gradual estrangement a violent dispute arose between&nbsp;them in 1865, which for many months divided into two&nbsp;hostile forces the universities and the press of Germany.&nbsp;Both sides were steeped in fault, but Ritschl undoubtedly&nbsp;received harsh treatment from the Prussian Government,&nbsp;and pressed his resignation. He renounced not only&nbsp;Bonn but Prussia, though strongly attached to his&nbsp;country, which he had often refused to leave when plied&nbsp;with advantageous offers. He accepted a call to Leipsic,&nbsp;where he died in harness in 1876.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ritschl’s character was strongly marked. The spirited element in him was powerful, and to some at times he seemed overbearing,&nbsp;but his nature was noble at the core ; and, though intolerant of&nbsp;inefficiency and stupidity, he never asserted his personal claims in&nbsp;any mean or petty way. He was warmly attached to family and&nbsp;friends, and yearned continually after sympathy, yet he established&nbsp;real intimacy with only a few. Both at Breslau and at Bonn he&nbsp;complained of isolation, which (though he was himself unconscious&nbsp;of the fact) was in part the natural fruit of his own superiority.&nbsp;The interests of his pupils were at all times dear, perhaps even too&nbsp;dear, in his eyes. He was far from being a dreamy scholar ; his&nbsp;talent for practical affairs would have secured him eminence in&nbsp;almost any walk of life, and he was credited with diplomatic&nbsp;finesse. That Ritschl had a great faculty for organization is shown&nbsp;by his administration of the university library at Bonn, and by the&nbsp;eight years of labour which carried to success a work of infinite&nbsp;complexity, the famous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Priscæ Latinitatis Monunιenta Epigraphica&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Bonn, 1862). This volume presents in admirable facsimile, with&nbsp;prefatory notices and indexes, the Latin inscriptions from the&nbsp;earliest times to the end of the republic. It forms an introductory volume to the Berlin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Iηscriptioηum Latiηamm,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the excellence of which is largely due to the precept and example&nbsp;of Ritschl, though he had no hand in the later volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all that he did Ritschl exhibited rare genius combined with a precision unsurpassed. But to bring out to the full his great&nbsp;powers the zest of discovery was indispensable. When he was on&nbsp;the track of a new idea, he worked with a fiery energy which&nbsp;triumphed over his almost life-long physical weakness, and left him&nbsp;no peace till every difficulty was cleared away. But the toil of&nbsp;carrying his discoveries to their consequences lie was only too apt&nbsp;to leave to feebler hands than his own. He was fertile in great&nbsp;projects, and struck out the main ideas which should guide them,&nbsp;but one only did he pursue to absolute completion, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Priscæ&nbsp;Latinitatis Μonumenta,—</span><span class="font0">precisely because, from the nature of this&nbsp;work, he was buoyed up from first to last by the occurrence or the&nbsp;expectation of novelty. The results of RitschΓs life are mainly&nbsp;gathered up in a long series of monographs, for the most part&nbsp;of the highest finish, and rich in ideas which have leavened the&nbsp;scholarship of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a scholar, Ritschl was of the lineage of Bentley, to whom he looked up, like Hermann, with fervent admiration. His best efforts&nbsp;were spent in studying the languages and literatures of Greece and&nbsp;Rome, rather than the life of the Greeks and Romans. He was&nbsp;sometimes, but most unjustly, charged with taking a narrow view&nbsp;of ‘ ‘ Philologie. ” That he keenly appreciated the importance of&nbsp;ancient institutions and ancient art both his published papers&nbsp;and the records of his lectures amply testify. He had in reality&nbsp;no prejudice against any department of learning. He was ever&nbsp;anxious to discern precisely the work for which each pupil was&nbsp;fitted, and he despatched many explorers into fields where he&nbsp;could not labour himself. Ritschl for the most part devoted&nbsp;himself to the study of ancient poetry, and in particular of the&nbsp;early Latin drama. This formed the centre from which his&nbsp;investigations radiated. Starting from this he ranged over the&nbsp;whole remains of pre-Ciceronian Latin, and not only analysed but&nbsp;augmented the sources from which our knowledge of it must&nbsp;come. Before Ritschl the acquaintance of scholars with early Latin&nbsp;was so dim and restricted that it would perhaps be hardly an&nbsp;exaggeration to call him its real discoverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the world in general Ritschl was best known as a student of Plautus. When he began his studies, the text of that author was&nbsp;like some ancient picture, defaced alike by time and by much&nbsp;repainting. He cleared away the accretions of ages, and by efforts&nbsp;of that real genius which goes hand in hand with labour, brought&nbsp;to light many of the true features of the original. It is infinitely&nbsp;to be regretted that Ritschl’s results were never combined to form&nbsp;that monumental edition of Plautus of which he dreamed in his&nbsp;earlier life. For one such palace from the master builder’s hand&nbsp;we could well have sacrificed some of the abundant material which&nbsp;he left for punier architects to handle. RitschΓs examination of&nbsp;the Plautine MSS. was both laborious and brilliant, and greatly&nbsp;extended the knowledge of Plautus and of the ancient Latin drama.&nbsp;Of this two striking examples may be cited. By the aid of the&nbsp;Ambrosian palimpsest he recovered the name T. Maccius Plautus,&nbsp;for the vulgate M. Accius, and proved it correct by strong extraneous&nbsp;arguments. On the margin of the Palatine MSS. the marks C and&nbsp;DV continually recur, and had been variously explained. Ritschl&nbsp;proved that they meant “ Canticum” and “ Diverbium,” and hence&nbsp;showed that in the Roman comedy only the conversations in iambic&nbsp;senarii were not intended for the singing voice. Thus was brought&nbsp;into strong relief a fact without which there can be no true appreciation of Plautus, viz., that his plays were comic operas rather&nbsp;than comic dramas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In conjectural criticism Ritschl was inferior not only to his great predecessors but to some of his contemporaries. His emendations&nbsp;do not often present that perfect wedding of art and fortune which&nbsp;we see in the best work of Madvig or Cobet. His imagination was&nbsp;in this field (but in this field only) hampered by erudition, and his&nbsp;judgment was unconsciously warped by the desire to find in his&nbsp;text illustrations of his discoveries. His remedies were often needlessly violent. But still a fair proportion of his textual labours&nbsp;has stood the test of time, and he forged the weapons which are&nbsp;destined to conquer for us the true text of Plautus, so far as an&nbsp;envious fate permits. Ritschl rendered immense service by his&nbsp;study of Plautine metres, a field in which little advance had been&nbsp;made since the time of Bentley. In this matter Ritschl was&nbsp;aided by an accomplishment rare (as he himself lamented) in&nbsp;Germany—the art of writing Latin verse.</span></p>
