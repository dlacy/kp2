<p><span class="font2">1558. A later result of his visit was his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Ecclesiastica dd scisma del Reyno de Inglaterra</span><span class="font2"> (1588-1594), often reprinted,&nbsp;and used in later editions of N. Sander’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Origine el Pro-gressu Schismatis Anglicani.</span><span class="font2"> In 1560 he was made Provincial&nbsp;of the Society of Jesus in Tuscany, thence transferred as Provincial to Sicily in 1563, again employed in Flanders, and&nbsp;from 1571 in Spain. In 1574 he settled in Madrid, where&nbsp;he died on the 10th of September 1611. His most important&nbsp;work is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Loyola</span><span class="font2"> (1572), which he was the first to&nbsp;write. In his first edition of the Life, as also in the second&nbsp;enlarged issue (1587), Ribadeneira affirmed that Loyola had&nbsp;wrought no miracle, except the foundation of his Society&nbsp;(thus making his claim parallel with that of Mahomet, whose&nbsp;only miracle, originally, was the Koran). In the process for&nbsp;the canonization of Loyola, a narrative published by Riba-deneira in 1609 exhibited miracles; and these are recorded&nbsp;in an abridgment of the Life by Ribadeneira (published posthumously in 1612) with a statement by Ribadeneira that he&nbsp;had known of them in 1572 but was not then satisfied of their&nbsp;proof. For this change of opinion he is taken to task by Bayle.&nbsp;That Ribadeneira was, though an able, a very credulous writer,&nbsp;is shown by his lives of the successors of Loyola in the generalship of the Society, Lainez and Borgia; and especially by&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Flos Sanctorum</span><span class="font2"> (1599-1610), a collection of saints’ lives,&nbsp;entirely superseded by the labours of the Bollandists. His&nbsp;other works are numerous but of little moment, including&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tratado de la religion</span><span class="font2"> (1595), intended as a refutation of&nbsp;Machiavelli<sup>i</sup>S </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prince.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">’ RIBALD, a word now only used in the sense of jeering, irreverent, abusive, particularly applied to the uses of low,&nbsp;offensive or mocking jests. It has an interesting early history,&nbsp;of which Du Cange (Gloss, s.v. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ribaldi)</span><span class="font2"> gives a full account.&nbsp;It is one of those words, like the Greek </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">τύραννος,</span><span class="font2"> an unconstitutional ruler, and the Latin </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">latro,</span><span class="font2"> a hired soldier, mercenary,&nbsp;later robber, which have acquired a degraded and evil significance. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribaldi</span><span class="font2"> were light-armed soldiers, on whom&nbsp;fell the duty of being first in attack, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">enfans perdus</span><span class="font2"> or “ forlorn hope ” of the armies of the French kings; thus Rigordus,&nbsp;in his contemporary history of the reign of Philip Augustus,&nbsp;for the year 1180, speaks of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ribaldi . . . qui primos impetus in expuguandis munitionibus facere Consueverunt<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2">  Later&nbsp;we find the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribaldi</span><span class="font2"> among the rabble of camp-followers of&nbsp;an army, and Giovanni Villani, in his 16th-century </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(11, 139), speaks of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribaldi et i raguazzi del hoste,</span><span class="font2"> and Froissart&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribaux</span><span class="font2"> as the lowest ranks in an army. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ribaldus (riband)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">was thus a common name for everything ruffianly and abandoned, and Matthew Paris </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann.</span><span class="font2"> 1251) says: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pures, exules,&nbsp;fugitivi, excommunicati, quos omnes Ribaldos Francia Vulgariter&nbsp;Consuevit appellare.</span><span class="font2"> The name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ribaldae</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ribaldi)</span><span class="font2"> was particularly applied to prostitutes, brothel-keepers and all who frequent haunts of vice, and there was at the French court from&nbsp;the 12th century an official, known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rex Ribaldorum,</span><span class="font2"> king&nbsp;of the ribalds, changed in the reign of Charles VI. to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prae-positus Hospitii Regis,</span><span class="font2"> whose duty was to investigate and hold&nbsp;judicial inquiry into all crimes committed within the precincts&nbsp;of the court, and control vagrants, prostitutes, brothels and&nbsp;gambling-houses. The etymology of the word has been much&nbsp;discussed, and no certainty can be arrived at. The termination&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—ald—</span><span class="font2">points to a Teutonic origin, and connexion has been&nbsp;suggested with O.H.Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hripä,</span><span class="font2"> M.H.Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ribe,</span><span class="font2"> prostitute, with&nbsp;Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reiben,</span><span class="font2"> rub, or with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rauben,</span><span class="font2"> rob.

<p><span class="font2">RIBAULT (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ribaut),</span><span class="font2"> JEAN </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 1520-1565), French navigator, famous for his connexion with the early settlement&nbsp;of Florida, was born at Dieppe, probably about 1520. Appointed&nbsp;by Admiral Coligny to the command of an expedition to prepare&nbsp;an asylum for French Protestants in America, Ribault sailed&nbsp;on the 18th of February 1562, with two vessels, and on the&nbsp;ist of May landed in Florida at St John’s river, or, as he called&nbsp;it, Rivière de Mai. Having settled his colonists at Port Royal&nbsp;Harbour (now Paris Island, South Carolina), and built Fort&nbsp;Charles for their protection, he returned to France to find the&nbsp;country in the throes of the Civil War. In 1563 he appears to&nbsp;have been in England and to have issued </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">True and Last Discoverie&nbsp;of Florida</span><span class="font2"> (Hakluyt Soc., vol. vii.). In April 1564 Coligny was&nbsp;in a position to despatch another expedition under René de&nbsp;Laudonnière, but meanwhile Ribault’s colony had come to an&nbsp;untimely end—the unfortunate adventurers, destitute of supplies from home, having revolted against their governor and&nbsp;attempted to make their way back to Europe in a boat which&nbsp;was happily picked up, when they were in the last extremities,&nbsp;by an English vessel. In 1565 Ribault was again sent out to&nbsp;satisfy Coligny as to Laudonnière’s management of his new&nbsp;settlement, Fort Caroline, on the Rivière de Mai. While he&nbsp;was still there the Spaniards, under Menendez de Aviles, though&nbsp;their country was at peace with France, attacked the French&nbsp;ships at the mouth of the river. Ribault set out to retaliate&nbsp;on the Spanish fleet, but his vessels were wrecked by a storm&nbsp;near Matanzas Inlet and he had to attempt to return to Fort&nbsp;Caroline by land. The fort had by this time fallen into the&nbsp;hands of the Spaniards, who had slaughtered all the colonists&nbsp;except a few who got off with two ships under Ribault’s son.&nbsp;Induced to surrender by false assurances of safeguard, Ribault&nbsp;and his men were also put to the sword in October 1565. The&nbsp;massacre was avenged in kind by Dominique de Gourgues&nbsp;(d. 1583) two years later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIBBECK, JOHANN CARL OTTO (1827-1898), German classical scholar, was born at Erfurt in Saxony on the 23 rd of&nbsp;July 1827. Having held professorial appointments at Kiel&nbsp;and Heidelberg, he succeeded his tutor Ritschl in the chair of&nbsp;classical philology at Leipzig, where he died on the 18th of July&nbsp;1898. Ribbeck was the author of several standard works on&nbsp;the poets and poetry of Rome, the most important of which are&nbsp;the following: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der römischen Dichtung</span><span class="font2"> (2nd ed.,&nbsp;1894-1900); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die römische Tragödie im Zeitalter der Republik&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1875); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scaenicae Romanorum Poesis Fragmenta,</span><span class="font2"> including the&nbsp;tragic and comic fragments (3rd ed., 1897). As a textual critic&nbsp;he was distinguished by considerable rashness, and never hesitated&nbsp;to alter, rearrange or reject as spurious what failed to reach&nbsp;his standard of excellence. These tendencies are strikingly&nbsp;shown in his editions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ars Poetica</span><span class="font2"> of Horace&nbsp;(1869), the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Satires</span><span class="font2"> of Juvenal (1859) and in the supplementary&nbsp;essay </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der echte und unechte Juvenal</span><span class="font2"> (1865). In later years,&nbsp;however, he became much more COMervative. His edition of&nbsp;Virgil (2nd ed., 1894-1895), although only critical, is a work&nbsp;of great erudition, especially the Prolegomena. His biography&nbsp;of Ritschl (1879-1881) is one of the best works of its kind. The&nbsp;influence of his tutor may be seen in Ribbeck’s critical edition&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Miles Gloriosus</span><span class="font2"> of Plautus, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beiträge zur Lehre von den&nbsp;lateinischen Partikeln,</span><span class="font2"> a work of much promise, which causes&nbsp;regret that he did not publish further results of his studies in&nbsp;that direction. His miscellaneous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reden und Vorträge</span><span class="font2"> were&nbsp;published after his death (Leipzig, 1899). He took great interest&nbsp;in the monumental </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus Linguae Latinae,</span><span class="font2"> and it was&nbsp;chiefly owing to his efforts that the government of Saxony was&nbsp;induced to assist its production by a considerable subsidy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chief authority for his life is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Otto Ribbeck; ein Bild seines Lebens aus seinen Briefen</span><span class="font1"> (1901), ed. by Emma Ribbeck.</span></p>
