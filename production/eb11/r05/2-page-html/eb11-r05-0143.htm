<p><span class="font0">crews increased 19J %, the number of men employed in the latter year being approximately 150,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In i860 Russia possessed less than 1000 m. of railways; by 1885 this had increased to 16,155 19., and by the middle of 1905 there&nbsp;were open for traffic over 40,500 m. of railway, of which&nbsp;34,150 m. or 84*3 % were in European Russia and nearly</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6400 m. (15*7 %) in Asiatic Russia. Between 1895 and 1905 the building of railways proceeded at a rapid rate, the total length&nbsp;nearly doubling within the ten years, namely, from 22,600 to&nbsp;40,500 m. The European railways cost on an average £10,465 per&nbsp;mile to construct, and the Asiatic railways £5092 per mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A considerable number of new railways, some of great strategic as well as commercial importance, were built during the last twenty&nbsp;years of the 19th century. At the same time the chief lines of&nbsp;railway which had been built by public companies with a state&nbsp;guarantee, and which represented a loss to the empire of £3,171,250&nbsp;per annum, as well as a growing indebtedness, were bought by the&nbsp;state. On the whole, the state derives profit from its railways,&nbsp;although several of the later lines, while imperative for state purposes, must necessarily yield but a very small revenue, or be worked&nbsp;at a loss. The most important of the new railways is the Siberian,&nbsp;of which the first section, Chelyabinsk to Omsk, was opened in&nbsp;December 1895, and which, except for a short section round Lake&nbsp;Baikal, in 1901 was completed right through to Stryetensk, on the&nbsp;Shilka, the head of navigation on the Shilka and the Amur, 2710 m.&nbsp;from Chelyabinsk and 4076 miles from Moscow, via Samara and&nbsp;Chelyabinsk. The section round the S. end of Lake Baikal was&nbsp;completed in 1905. At the Pacific end of the Siberian railway a&nbsp;line connecting Vladivostok with Khabarovsk (479 m.) at the&nbsp;junction of the Amur and the Usuri, was first of all built, following&nbsp;the valley of the Usuri. But it was soon found that the cost of the&nbsp;section^required to complete the railway between Stryetensk and&nbsp;Khabarovsk, along the Shilka (246 m.) and the Amur (1160 m.),&nbsp;would be enormous, while neither the wild mountainous tracts of&nbsp;the lower Shilka and upper Amur, nor the marshy, often inundated&nbsp;region between Khabarovsk and the Little Khingan mountains,&nbsp;could ever be the seat of a numerous population. Consequently a&nbsp;company was formed by the Russian government in 1896 to construct, with the consent of the Chinese government, a railway from&nbsp;Vladivostok across Manchuria to Karymskaya near Chita in Transbaikalia. This runs for 222 m. on Russian territory and for 1080 m.&nbsp;on Manchurian territory, and from Kharbin sends off a branch to&nbsp;Dalny near Port Arthur on the Liao-tung peninsula. The first&nbsp;portion of the Manchurian railway, built by Russian engineers,&nbsp;with Chinese labour, was finished in 1902. At . the same time&nbsp;several secondary lines were built in connexion with the Siberian&nbsp;line. Chelyabinsk was linked by a transverse line with the middle&nbsp;Urals railway, which connects Perm, the head of navigation in&nbsp;the Volga basin, with Tyumen, the head of navigation on the Ob and&nbsp;Irtysh, passing through Ekaterinburg and other mining centres of&nbsp;the middle Urals. Tomsk is now connected with the main line by&nbsp;a short side branch. A railway has also been built to connect Perm&nbsp;with Kotlas, near the confluence of the Sukhona with the .Yug,&nbsp;at the head of the N. Dvina. This N. portion of the Russian railway&nbsp;system was further completed by the opening in 1906 of a line from&nbsp;St Petersburg via Vologda to Vyatka, intersecting the Moscow-Arthangel line at Vologda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another line of great strategic importance was built across the Transcaspian territory to Ferghana. Starting from Krasnovodsk,&nbsp;it runs S.E. to Merv (560 m.), with a branch line (194 m.) to Kushk,&nbsp;near Herat, then N.E. across the desert to Charjui, on the Amur&nbsp;river, Bokhara and the Russian fort Katta-kurgan, and then to&nbsp;Samarkand, Kokand and Andijan in Ferghana, 710 m. from Merv,&nbsp;with a branch to Tashkent (220 m.). This railway has become&nbsp;important for the export of raw cotton from Central Asia to Russia.&nbsp;In 1905 a second totally independent line was opened from Tashkent |&nbsp;down the Syr-darya to Kazalinsk, and thence to Orenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A third line of great importance is the junction line between the Transcaucasian railway—which runs from Batum and Poti to, Baku,&nbsp;via Tiflis, with a branch line to Kars—and the railway system of&nbsp;Russia proper. This junction has been effected not across the main&nbsp;Caucasus range, but at its E. extremity, that is, via the Caspian&nbsp;ports of Baku and Petrovsk, which are connected with Vladikavkaz&nbsp;(Beslan junction). The Black Sea j)ort of Novorossiysk, in W.&nbsp;Caucasia, having been connected with the Rostov-Vladikavkaz&nbsp;line, has consequently also been brought into touch with the Russian&nbsp;railways. The Volga is reached from central Russia by seven lines&nbsp;of railways, including one to Kazan, and three main lines radiate&nbsp;from the Volga E. (one to Siberia and two to the Ural river), while the&nbsp;upper Volga (Yaroslavl) is connected with Archangel by a line 523 m.&nbsp;long. A zone tariff was introduced on the Russian railways in 1894,&nbsp;and the cost of long journeys was considerably reduced; a journey of&nbsp;623 m. can be made third class at a cost of only about 17 shillings,&nbsp;while for less than twice as much 1990 m. can be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fish form an important article of national food. The numerous fasts of the national church prescribe a fish diet on many days in the&nbsp;year, and the continuous frost of winter is favourable to&nbsp;the transportation of fish for great distances. Along the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Murman coast of the Arctic Ocean and in the White Sea, where many millions of herrings are caught annually by some 3000 persons, the&nbsp;yearly producers estimated at the value of £140,000. In the Baltic&nbsp;Sea, as well as in the lakes of its basin (Ladoga, Onega, llmefi, &amp;e.),&nbsp;the yearly value is estimated at £200,000. Of anchovies alone,&nbsp;10,000,000 jars are prepared annually, while salted fish is, next after&nbsp;bread, the staple food of large masses of the population. The Black&nbsp;Sea fisheries, in which about 4000 men are engaged, yield fish&nbsp;valued at £300,000 per annum. The value of the fish has much&nbsp;increased owing to the introduction of cold storage; as a result of&nbsp;the employment of this method of packing, fish is now exported in a&nbsp;fresh state from the Black Sea to all parts of S.W. Russia, and even&nbsp;to Moscow. The annual yield of the Azov Sea fisheries, occupying&nbsp;15,000 men, is valued at £600,000. In the Volga section of the&nbsp;Caspian Sea fish arc caught to the value of about £1,000,000 annually ;&nbsp;in the Ural section over 40,000 tons of fish and nearly 1500 tons of&nbsp;caviare are obtained. The total value of the Caspian fisheries is&nbsp;estimated at £3,000,000 per annum. Taking the Lake Aral and&nbsp;Siberian, river fisheries into account, it is estimated that altogether&nbsp;the fishing industries yield a revenue to the state of £330,000&nbsp;annually.@@<sup>1</sup> In addition from 13,000 to 60,000 seals and about 200&nbsp;whales are killed annually off the Murman coast. Hunting is an&nbsp;occupation of considerable importance in N. and N.E. Russia, and&nbsp;along the shores of the Arctic Ocean.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The history of Russia may be conveniently divided into four consecutive periods: (1) the period of Independent&nbsp;Principalities; (2) the Mongol Domination; (3) the Tsardom&nbsp;of Muscovy; and (4) the Modem Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conglomeration of Independent Principalities.—</span><span class="font1">The first period, like the early history of many other countries, begins&nbsp;with a legend. Nestor, an old monkish chronicler&nbsp;of Kiev, relates that in the middle of the 9th century&nbsp;the Slav and Finnish tribes inhabiting the forest&nbsp;region around Lake Ilmen, between Lake Ladoga and the upper&nbsp;waters of the Dnieper, paid tribute to military adventurers&nbsp;from the land of Rüs, which is commonly supposed to have&nbsp;been a part of Sweden. In the year 859 these tribes expelled&nbsp;the Northmen, but finding that they quarrelled among&nbsp;themselves, they invited them, three years later, to return.&nbsp;Our land, said the deputation sent to Rüs for this purpose, is&nbsp;great and fertile, but there is no order in it; come and reign&nbsp;and rule over us. Three brothers, princes of Rüs, called respectively Rurik, Sineus and Truvor, accepted the invitation&nbsp;and founded a dynasty, from which many of the Russian&nbsp;princes of the present day claim descent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Who were those warlike men of Rus who are universally recognized as the founders of the Russian Empire? This&nbsp;question has given rise to an enormous amount of discussion&nbsp;among learned men, and some of the disputants have not yet&nbsp;laid down their arms; but for impartial outsiders who have&nbsp;carefully studied the evidence there can be little doubt that</span></p>
