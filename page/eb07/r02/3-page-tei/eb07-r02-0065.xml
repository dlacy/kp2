From school he was sent to the university of St Andrews, where his progress was so rapid, that he was made professor of philosophy soon after he took the degree of A. M.</p><p>The magistrates of Edinburgh having petitioned the king to found a university in that city, they obtained a charter, by which they were allowed all the privileges of a university, which was built in 1582, and Mr Rollock was chosen principal and professor of divinity. He was soon famous in the university on account of his lectures, and among his countrymen at large for his persuasive mode of preaching. In the year 1593, Rollock and others were appointed by parliament to confer with the popish lords ; and in the following year he was one of those made choice of by the General Assembly to present his majesty with a paper entitled “ The dangers which, through the impunity of excommunicated papists, traffickers with the Spaniards, and other enemies of the religion and state, are imminent to the true religion professed within this realm, his majesty’s person, crown, and liberty of this our native country.” Their zeal against popery was carried to excess, and they seem to have been of opinion, that it was incumbent on the civil magistrate to punish idolatry with death. In the year 1595, he was empowered, along with others, to visit the different universities in Scotland, with a view to inquire into the doctrine and practice of the different masters, the discipline adopted by them, and the state of their rents and living, which they were ordered to report to the next General Assembly.</p><p>He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly in the year 1597, at which period he was fortunate enough to obtain the redress of several glaring abuses. The greater part of his life was spent in conducting the affairs of the church, yet Spotswood assures us that he would rather have' preferred retirement and study. Indeed the feebleness of his constitution was not equal to the hurry and bustle of public life, and it led him to prefer the retirement of study. He was very much affected with the stone, the pains of which he bore with the fortitude and resignation of a Christian. He died at Edinburgh on the last day of February 1598, in the forty-third year of his age. Short as his life was, he published many works, of which the following is a catalogue. A Commentary on the first book of Beza’s Questions ; on St Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians ; on the prophet Daniel ; a Logical Analysis of St Paul’s Epistle to the Romans ; some Questions and Answers concerning the Covenant of Grace and the Sacraments ; a Treatise of Effectual Calling ; a Commentary on the Epistles of Paul to the Thessalonians and Philemon ; on fifteen select Psalms ; on the Gospel of St John, with a Harmony of the four Evangelists upon theDeath, Resurrection, and Ascension of Jesus Christ ; certain Sermons on several places of St Paul’s Epistles ; a Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians ; a Logical Analysis of the Epistle to the Hebrews ; of the Epistle to the Galatians ; a Commentary upon t he first two chapters of the first Epistle of St Peter ; a Treatise of Justification, and another of Excommunication. AH these, except the Sermons, were written in Latin. Of the pious and learned author, a more particular account may be found in a volume printed under the subsequent title : “ De Vita et Morte Roberti Rollok, Academiæ Edinburgenæ Primarii, Narrationes, auctoribus Georgio Robertson et Henrico Charteris.” Edinb. 1826, 4 to. Robertson’s biographical tract was originally published in 1599. That of Charteris was printed from a manuscript in the public library of the university.</p><p>ROLPAH, a town of Northern Hindustan, and capital of a district of the same name, in the province of Nepaul. It is a woody country, governed by a chief, who pays an annual tribute to the rajah of Nepaul.

Under the head Reformation is given a history of the successful struggles made by sevetal of the states of Europe to deliver themselves from priestly domination ; and for a view of the theological tenets of the Roman Catholics, we may refer to the articles Pope, Popery, Purgatory, &amp;c. It only remains that we shortly notice the extent to which the Roman Catholic faith prevails in the world at the present day, and the political state of its adherents in our own country.</p><p>There is no country where popery is the established reli gion, in the same sense in which the Churches of England and Scotland are the established religion of Britain. The Catholic clergy everywhere claim <hi rend="italic">independent,</hi>  if not supreme authority, and never form any political alliance with the state. In some countries, however, popery is not only the religion of the government, but also exclusively, or almost exclusively, of the people ; and to that extent it may be called the <hi rend="italic">established religion</hi>  of the state. In others, the people are divided between the catholic and the protestant faith, and both are recognised by the government. The cruelty and oppression which have been perpetrated by religious zealots, ambitious priests, and crafty rulers, under the sacred name of religion, have given occasion to the infidel and the scoffer to cast on Christianity itself the reproach which is due only to fanaticism and bigotry. Tothisreproach both Catholic and Protestant are liable ; but there can be no doubt, that in the efforts,of the Church of Rome to maintain its ancient dominion over the human mind, it has been more unscrupulous in the use of persecution than the Protestant powers. Happily, however, the fierceness of persecution has now greatly abated in catholic countries ; and, on the other hand, Catholics are tolerated in every protestant state.</p><p>In France the <hi rend="italic">Charte</hi>  gives freedom of worship to all religions; butabout 14-15ths of the people belong to the Catholic Church, the small remainder being Protestants.</p><p>In Switzerland, outer Appenzell, almost the whole of Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen, Vaud, and Neufchatel, the greater part of Glarus, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, and Geneva, and the minority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall, profess Calvinism. <hi rend="italic">Catholicism</hi>  is professed exclusively in Lucerne, Uri, Schwitz, Unterwald, Zug, inner Appenzell, Fessin, and Valais ; by the majority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall ; and by the minority in theother cantons. About 12-20ths of the Swiss are Protestant; the remainder Catholics.</p><p>In Belgium all religions are freely professed; butcatho-licism is the religion of almost the entire nation.</p><p>In Holland all religions are professed with equal freedom ; but Calvinism is the religion of the state. The Catholics are comparatively few.</p><p>In Germany catholicism and protestantism are so mixed, that it is scarcely possible to assign them definite limits, or approximate to their relative numbers. Protestantism, however, prevails mostly in the northern and south-western parts of the country; popery in the south-east, south, and west. Their numbers are not far from being equal.</p><p>In the Austrian empire popery is the dominant religion, and professed by the great majority of the inhabitants.</p><p>In Prussia protestantism is the government religion ; but the professors of all religions enjoy freedom of worship, and almost equal rights. Lutheranism is professed by the great majority in East Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and Saxony; popery in the Westphalian and Rhenish provinces, and the grand-duchy of Posen. Silesiaand West Prussia are almost equally divided.</p><p>In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Lutheranism is the</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
