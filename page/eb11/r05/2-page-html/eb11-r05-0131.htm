<p><span class="font1">of higher schools, in which careful instruction is given in natural and social sciences, have been opened in the chief cities under&nbsp;the name of “ pedagogical courses.” At St Petersburg a women's&nbsp;medical academy, the examinations of which were even more&nbsp;searching than those of the ordinary academy (especially as regards&nbsp;diseases of women and children), was opened, but after about one&nbsp;hundred women had received the degree of M.D. it was suppressed&nbsp;by government. In several university towns there are free teaching&nbsp;establishments for women, supported by subscription, with programmes and examinations equal to those of the universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The natural sciences are much cultivated in Russia. Besides the Academy of Science, the Moscow Society of Naturalists, the&nbsp;Mineralogical Society, the Geographical Society, with its&nbsp;Caucasian and Siberian branches, the archaeological&nbsp;societies and the scientific societies of the Baltic provinces, all of which are of old and recognized standing, there have&nbsp;lately sprung up a series of new societies in connexion with each&nbsp;university, and their serials are yearly growing in importance, as,&nbsp;too, are those of the Moscow Society of Friends of Natural Science,&nbsp;the Chemico-Physical Society, and various medical, educational&nbsp;and other associations. The work achieved by Russian savants,&nbsp;especially in biology, physiology and chemistry, and in the sciences&nbsp;descriptive.of the vast territory of Russia, is well known to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ordinary revenue of the empire is in excess of the ordinary expenditure, but.the extraordinary expenditure not only swallows&nbsp;up this surplus, but necessitates the raising, of fresh&nbsp;loans every year. On the other hand, there is a good&nbsp;deal to show for this extraordinary expenditure. A considerable&nbsp;number of new railways, including the Siberian, have been built&nbsp;with money obtained from that source. But since 1894 all extraordinary items of expenditure, with the exception of those for&nbsp;the construction of new lines of railway, have been defrayed out&nbsp;of. ordinary, revenue. The only sources of extraordinary revenue&nbsp;still remaining under that head are the money derived from loans&nbsp;and the perpetual deposits in the Imperial Bank. The ordinary&nbsp;revenue,- obtained principally from the sale of spirits (28%),&nbsp;which is a state monopoly, from state railways (23 j%) and customs&nbsp;(10j%), steadily rose from a total of £132,750,000 in 1895 to a&nbsp;total of £214,360,000 in 1905. Other noteworthy sources of&nbsp;revenue are trade licences, direct taxes on lands and forests, stamp&nbsp;duties, posts and telegraphs, indirect taxes on tobacco, sugar&nbsp;and other commodities, the crown forests, and land redemption&nbsp;payable annually by the peasants since 1861. At the same time&nbsp;the total ordinary expenditure has increased at a similarly steady&nbsp;rate, namely, from £119,391,000 in 1895 to £202,544,000 in 1905. In&nbsp;1904, 8ii%of the extraordinary expenditure, namely, £71,550,000,&nbsp;was incurred in consequence of the war with Japan, and to&nbsp;this must be added in 1906 a further expenditure of £42,085,000.&nbsp;The total national debt of Russia nearly trebled between 1852&nbsp;(£57,038,600) and 1862 (£145,500,000), and again between 1872&nbsp;(£242,277,000) and 1892 (£526,109,000) it more than doubled,&nbsp;while by 1906 it amounted altogether to £812,040,000. Of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">total, 77% stands at 4% and 17 at less than 4%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The system of obligatory military service for all, introduced in 1874, has been maintained, but the six years' term of service has&nbsp;been reduced to five, while the privileges granted.to&nbsp;young men who have received various degrees of education&nbsp;have been slightly extended. During the reign of Alexander III.&nbsp;efforts were mainly directed towards—(1) reducing the time required&nbsp;for the mobilization of the army; (2) increasing.the immediate&nbsp;readiness of cavalry for war and its fitness for serving as mounted&nbsp;infantry (dragoon regiments taking the place of hussars and&nbsp;lancers ; (3) strengthening the W. frontier by fortresses .and&nbsp;railways; and (4) increasing the artillery, siege and train reserves.&nbsp;Further, the age releasing from service was raised from 40 to 43&nbsp;years and the militia </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(landsturm)</span><span class="font1"> was reorganized. The measures&nbsp;taken during the reign of Nicholas II. have been chiefly directed&nbsp;towards increasing tne fighting capacity and readiness for immediate service of the troops in Asia,, and towards the better reorganization of the local irregular militia forces. Broadly, speaking,&nbsp;the army is divided into regulars, Cossacks and militia. The&nbsp;peace strength of the army is estimated at .42,000 officers and&nbsp;1,100,000 men (about 950,000 combatants), while the war strength&nbsp;is approximately 75,000 officers and 4,500,000 men. However,&nbsp;this latter figure is merely nominal, the available artillery and&nbsp;train service being much below the strength which would be&nbsp;required for such an army; estimates which put the military&nbsp;forces of Russia in time of war at 2,750,000—irrespective of the&nbsp;armies which may be levied during the war itself—seem to approach&nbsp;more nearly the strength of the forces which could actually be&nbsp;mustered. The infantry and rifles are armed with small-bore&nbsp;magazine rifles, and the active artillery have steel breech-loaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with extreme ranges of 4150 to 4700 yds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before the Japanese war Russia maintained four separate squadrons: the Baltic, the Black Sea, the Pacific and the Caspian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in the operations before Port Arthur and in the disastrous battle of Tsushima the Russian fleets were&nbsp;almost completely annihilated. The bulk of the Black Sea fleet&nbsp;and a few other battleships were, however, still left, and since 1904</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">steps have been taken to build new ships, both battleships and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">g</span><span class="font1">owerful cruisers. Kronstadt is the naval headquarters in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">¡altic, Sevastopol in the Black Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fortresses.—</span><span class="font1">The chief first-class fortresses of Russia are Warsaw and Novogeorgievsk in Poland, and Brest-Litovsk and Kovno in&nbsp;Lithuania. The second-class fortresses are Kronstadt and Sveaborg&nbsp;in the Gulf of Finland, Ivangorod in Poland, Libau on the Baltic&nbsp;Sea, Kerch on the Black Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific.&nbsp;In the third class are Viborg in Finland, Ossovets and Ust Dvinsk&nbsp;(or Dtinamtinde) in Lithuania, Sevastopol and Ochakov on the&nbsp;Black Sea, and Kars and Batum in Caucasia. There are, moreover, 46 forts and fortresses unclassed, of which 6 are in Poland,&nbsp;8 in W. and S.W. Russia, and the remainder (mere fortified posts)&nbsp;in the Asiatic dominions.</span></p><h3><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">II. European Russia</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geography.—</span><span class="font2">The administrative boundaries of European Russia, apart from Finland, coincide broadly with the natural&nbsp;limits of the East-European plains. In the N. it is&nbsp;bounded by the Arctic Ocean; the islands of Novaya-Zemlya, Kolguyevand Vaigach also belong to it, but&nbsp;the Kara Sea is reckoned to Siberia. To the E. it has the&nbsp;Asiatic dominions of the empire, Siberia and the Kirghiz steppes,&nbsp;from both of which it is separated by the Ural Mountains, the&nbsp;Ural river and the Caspian—the administrative boundary,&nbsp;however, partly extending into Asia on the Siberian slope of&nbsp;the Urals. To the S. it has the Black Sea and Caucasia, being&nbsp;separated from the latter by the Manych depression, which in&nbsp;Post-Pliocene times connected the Sea of Azov with the Caspian.&nbsp;The W. boundary is purely conventional: it crosses the peninsula&nbsp;of Kola from the Varanger Fjord to the Gulf of Bothnia; thence&nbsp;it runs to the Kurisches Haff in the southern’Baltic, and thence&nbsp;to the mouth of the Danube, taking a great circular sweep to the&nbsp;W. to embrace Poland, and separating Russia from Prussia,&nbsp;Austrian Galicia and Rumania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a special feature of Russia that she has no free outlet to the open sea except on the ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean.&nbsp;Even the White Sea is merely a gulf of that ocean. The deep&nbsp;indentations of the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland are surrounded&nbsp;by what is ethnologically Finnish territory, and it is only at the&nbsp;very head of the latter gulf that the Russians have taken firm&nbsp;foothold by erecting their capital at the mouth of the Neva.&nbsp;The Gulf of Riga and the Baltic belong also to territory which&nbsp;is not inhabited by Slavs, but by Finnish races and by Germans.&nbsp;It is only within the last hundred and thirty years that the&nbsp;Russians have definitely taken possession of the N. shores of the&nbsp;Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The E. coast of the Black Sea&nbsp;belongs properly to Transcaucasia, a great chain of mountains&nbsp;separating it from Russia. But even this sheet of water is an&nbsp;inland sea, the only outlet of which, the Bosphorus, is in foreign&nbsp;hands, while the Caspian, an immense shallow’ lake, mostly&nbsp;bordered by deserts, possesses more importance as a link between&nbsp;Russia and her Asiatic settlements than as a channel for intercourse with other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great territory occupied by European Russia—1600 m. in length from N. to S., and nearly as much from E. to W.—is on&nbsp;the whole a broad elevated plain, ranging between 500 and&nbsp;900 ft. above sea-level, deeply cut into by river-valleys, and bounded on all sides by broad swellings&nbsp;or low mountain-ranges: the lake plateaus of Finland&nbsp;and the Maanselka heights in the N.W.; the Baltic coast-ridge&nbsp;and spurs of the Carpathians in the W., with a broad depression&nbsp;between the two, occupied by Poland; the Crimean and&nbsp;Caucasian mountains in the S.; and the broad but moderately&nbsp;high swelling of the Ural Mountains in the E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From a central plateau, which comprises the governments of Tver, Moscow, Smolensk and Kursk, and projects E. towards Samara,&nbsp;attaining an average elevation of 800 to 900 ft. above the sea, the&nbsp;surface slopes gently in all directions to a level of 300 to 500 ft.&nbsp;Then it again nses gradually as it approaches the hilly tracts which&nbsp;enclose the great plain. This central swelling may be considered a&nbsp;continuation towards the E.N.E. of the great line of upheavals of&nbsp;N.W. Europe; the elevated grounds of Finland would then represent a continuation of the Scanian plateaus of S. Sw'eden, and the&nbsp;northern mountains of Finland a continuation of Kjfilen (the Keel)&nbsp;which separate Sweden from Norway, while the other great line of</span></p>
