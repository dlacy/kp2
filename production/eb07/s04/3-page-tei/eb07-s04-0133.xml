            <p>“ I believe it is now generally considered that the temperature 212° is that of water
                boiling when the barometer is at 30 inches instead of 29∙8 ; and if, in the above
                algebraic expressions, the following alterations be made, the results from the
                formulæ will correspond with the adjustment of that point, and fully as well with
                the experiments generally.</p>
            <p>“ Let T=∕ + 51.3 ; the index of the power and of the root be 5.13, instead of 5.14 ;
                and <hi rend="italic">m=</hi> 87344,000000. So the two last equations will be : 5.13
                LT—10.94123=LE;</p>
            <p>and <hi rend="superscript">LE+10.94123</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">5.13</hi> = LT.</p>
            <p>“ The table will stand as follows, supposing the thermo meter had been graduated for
                212° to correspond with 30 inches of the barometer :—</p>

            <p>28. In the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin</hi></p>
            <p>for 1782, there is an account of some experiments made by M. Achard on the elastic
                force of steam, from the temperature 32° to 212°. They agree extremely well with
                those mentioned here, rarely differing more than two or three-tenths of an inch. He
                also examined the elasticity of the vapour produced from alcohol, and when the
                elasticity was equal to that of the vapour of water, he found that the temperature
                was about 35° lower. Thus, when the elasticity of both was measured by 28.1
                inches</p>
            <p>of mercury, the temperature of the watery vapour was 209°, and that of the spirituous
                vapour was 173°. When the elasticity was 18.5, the temperature of the water was
                    189.5<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, and that of the alcohol 154.6°. When the
                elasticity was 11.05, the water was 168°, and the alcohol 134.4° Observing the
                difference between the temperature of equaIly elastic vapours of water and alcohol
                not to be con stant, but gradually to diminish, in M. Achard’s experi ments, along
                with the elasticity, it became interesting to discover whether, and at what
                temperature, this difference would vanish altogether. Experiments were accordingly
                made by the writer of this article, similar to those made with water. They were not
                made with the same scrunulous care, nor repeated as they deserved, but they
                furnished rather an unexpected result. The following table will give the reader a
                distinct notion of them.</p>

            <p>29. Dr Dalton appears to have been the first to escape from the natural enough error
                of assuming that the vapour of water at 32° would be = 0. His apparatus is the most
                simple and refined of any that have been employed for temperatures below 212°, and
                his experiments are those which, to the present day, have the greatest authority. Dr
                Dalton’s first experiments were published in 1793, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meteorological Essays ;</hi> afterwards, when more extended, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manchester Memoirs,</hi> 1802 ; then in the first volume of his
                    <hi rend="italic">System of Chemistry,</hi> 1808; and finally in the second
                volume of the same work, 1827. The following is the account given by himself, of his
                early experiments, in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Memoirs.</hi></p>
            <p>“ My method is this : I take a barometer tube AB, (Fig. 13,) perfectly dry, and fill
                it with mercury just boiled, marking the place (30) where it is stationary ; then,
                having graduated the tube, I pour a little water, or any other liquid, the subject
                of experiment, into it, so as to moisten the whole inside : after this I again pour
                in mercury, and carefully inverting the tube, exclude all air ; the barometer, by
                standing some time, exhibits a portion of water of <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi
                    rend="subscript">8</hi> or <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript"
                    >10</hi>th of an inch, W, on the top of the mercurial column ; because, being
                lighter, it ascends by the side of the tube, which may now be inclined, and the
                mercury will rise to the top, manifesting a perfect vacuum from air. I next take a
                cylindrical glass tube CD,</p>
            <p>open at both ends, of two inches diameter and fourteen inches in length,</p>
            <p>to each end of which a cork is adapted,</p>
            <p>perforated in the middle, so as to admit a barometer tube to be put through,</p>
            <p>and to be held fast by them ; the upper cork, C, is fixed two or three inches below
                the top of the tube, and is one-half cut away, so as to admit water, &amp;c., to
                pass by, its service being merely to keep the tube steady. Things being thus
                circumstanced ; water of any temperature may be poured into the wide tube, and thus
                made to surround the upper part or vacuum of the barometer, and the effect of
                temperature in the production of vapour within can be observed from the depression
                of the mercurial column at the top. In this way I have had water as high as 155°
                surrounding the vacuum ; but as the higher temperatures might endanger a glass
                apparatus, instead of it I used the following :—</p>
