<p><span class="font0">loyalty, the national cockade, which had been adopted by fome of the gardes du corps, was thrown aſide, and white cockades were ſupplied as quickly as&nbsp;they could be made by the ladies of the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When thefe events were next day reported at Paris, accompanied by a multitude of exaggerations, they&nbsp;gave rife to the moſt violent alarm. The capital was&nbsp;at that time ſuſſering all the horrors of famine ; and in&nbsp;ſuch a fituation, the news of a feaſt which others have&nbsp;enjoyed, ſeldom gives much pleafure to hungry men.&nbsp;To the former report of an intended flight on the part&nbsp;of the royal family, it was now added, that a counter&nbsp;revolution was fpeedily to be attempted by force of&nbsp;arms ; and that thc preſent fcarcity was artificially cre-ated by the court for the purpoſe of reducing the peo-ple to fubmiſſion. Their ariſtocratic antagoniſts have&nbsp;fince aſſerted, that the famine was indeed artificial ; but&nbsp;that it was created by a portion of the violent party in&nbsp;the national aſſembly, which was then denominated the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cabal,,</span><span class="font2"> whoſe object was to excite commotions as the&nbsp;means of procuring an opportunity of ſetting the duke&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">orleans at the head of the ſtate, either as regent, or&nbsp;in ſome other form. To this laſt party Mirabeau is&nbsp;faid to have belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For four days no notice was taken in the aſſembly of ■what had paffed at the entertainment given by the gardes&nbsp;du corps. Οη the 5th of october M. Petion mentioned&nbsp;it for the firſt time, and a violent debate enfued; during&nbsp;which Mirabeau rofe and exclaimed, “ Declare that the&nbsp;king’s perfon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alone</span><span class="font2"> is ſacred, and I rnyfelf will bring&nbsp;forward an impeachment thereby alluding to the&nbsp;conduct of the queen. while this debate wa3 pro-ceeding at verſaillcs, thc city of Paris was in commotion. A vaſt multitude of women of the loweſt&nbsp;rank, with fome men in womens clothes, had aſſem-bled at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hotel de Ville,</span><span class="font2"> and were ca∏ing aloud for&nbsp;arms and bread. They reſolved to proceed inſtantly&nbsp;to verfailles to demand bread from the king and from&nbsp;the national aſſembly. La Fayette oppυfed them in&nbsp;vain; for his own ſoldiers refufed to turn their bayonets&nbsp;againſt the women. Upon this one Staniſlaus Mail-lard, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the taking of the&nbsp;Baſtile, offered himſelf as a leader to the inſurgents. He&nbsp;had the addveſs to prevail with them to lay aſide ſuch&nbsp;arms as they had procured; and he ſet out for ∖er-failles about noon with as much order among his fυl-Iowers as could well be expected from ſuch an aſſenp&nbsp;blage. Either becaufe the paſſion for going to Verfailles&nbsp;had ſuddenly become too infectious to be reſiſted, or&nbsp;becaufe the multitude already gone thither was now ac-counted dangerous, the mayor and municipality of Pa-ris thought fit to give υrdeιs to la Fayette inſtantly&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">ſet out for that place at the head of the national&nbsp;guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the mean time, Maillard approached verfailles with his tumultuous troop ; he arranged them in three&nbsp;diviſions, and perfiiaded them to behave with tolerable&nbsp;decency. The king was hunting in the woods of&nbsp;Mendon when he was informed of the arrival of a moſt&nbsp;formidable band of women calling aloud for bread.&nbsp;&quot; Alas ! (replied he) if I had it, I ſhould not wait to&nbsp;be aſked.” Maillard entered the aſſembly accompa-nied by a deputation of his followers to ſtate the ob-ject of their journey. The aſſembly, to pacify them,&nbsp;feat </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">deputation of their own number along with them to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lay their complaints before the king. His majeſty recei-ved the whole with great politeneſs, and readily agreed to go into any meaſures for the fupply of the capital&nbsp;that could be ſuggeſted. The report of this behaviour&nbsp;had fuch an effect upon the multitude collected around&nbsp;the palace, that they began to difperſe ; but they were&nbsp;ſpeedily fucceeded by another croud not lefs numerous.&nbsp;A ſudden refolution of flight ſeems now to have been&nbsp;propoſed by the court ; for the king’s carriages were&nbsp;brought to the gate of the palace which communicatee&nbsp;with the orangry : but the ħational guard of Verfailleβ&nbsp;refuſed to allow them to paſs, and the king himſelf refufed to remove, or to allow any blood to be ſhed in&nbsp;his cauſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">La Fayette with his army at length arrived about 10 o’clock at night, and found the aſſembly in a very&nbsp;unpleaſant ſituation. Their hall and galleries were&nbsp;crowded by the Parifian fiſh-women and others of the&nbsp;mob, who, at eveιy inſtant, interrupted the debates.&nbsp;La Fayette waited upon the king, and informed him&nbsp;of the proceedings of the day, planted guards in every&nbsp;quarter ; and after a ſcanty banquet had been procured&nbsp;for the multitude, he prevailed with the aſſembly to&nbsp;clofe their fitting for the night. In this laſt part of&nbsp;his conduct M. la Fayette has been much cenfured,&nbsp;and probably not without reaſon ; for it could ſcarcely&nbsp;be expected that ſuch a night would be ſpent in peace&nbsp;by the immenſe aſſemblage of turbulent characters that&nbsp;were now brought together. All was quiet, however,&nbsp;till about fix in the morning of the 6th, when a great&nbsp;number of women anddefperate perſons ruſhed forward&nbsp;to the palace, and attempted to force their way into it.&nbsp;Two of the gardes du corps were killed ; the croud&nbsp;aſcend¢d the ſtair-caſe leading to the queen’s apartment,&nbsp;but were bravely reſiſted by M. Miemandre a ſentinel,&nbsp;who gave the alarm, and defended his poll till he fell&nbsp;covered with wounds, of which, however, he afterwards&nbsp;fortunately recovered. The ruffians, reeking with his&nbsp;blood, ruſhed into the chamber of the queen, and pierced with bayonets and poniards the bed whence this</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">perſecuted woman had but juft time to fly almoſt naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had eſca-ped to ſeek refuge at the feet of the king, who w as al-ready alarmed, and had gone to feek her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ί he tumult became more violent every moment, and fudden death feemed to threaten the royal family ; but&nbsp;la Fayette was by this time at the head of his troops,&nbsp;whom he befecched earneſtly to ſave the gardes du&nbsp;corps from maffacre. In this he was ſuccefsful ; ſome&nbsp;that had been taken priſoners were ſurrounded by the&nbsp;grenadiers of the French guards who protected them,&nbsp;and the retreat of the whole corps was eaſily ſecured.&nbsp;The croud was fpeediſy driven from the different quar-ters of the palace, which they were already beginning&nbsp;to pillage; and the royal family ventured to ſhow them-felves at a balcony. A few voices now exclaimed*&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Roi à Paris,</span><span class="font2"> &quot; the King to Paris.” Ιhe ſhout be-came general ; and the king, after conſulting with la&nbsp;Fayette, declared that he had no objection to take up&nbsp;his reſidence at Paris, provided he was accompanied by&nbsp;the queen and his children, when the propoſal was&nbsp;reported to the aſſembly, the popular leaders expreſſed&nbsp;much ſatisſaction. Ι'hey ordered a deputation of 100&nbsp;members to attend the king thither; they voted the national aſſembly inſeparable from the king.
