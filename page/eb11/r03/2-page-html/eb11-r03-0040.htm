<p><span class="font0">single-loader, and to reserve the magazine (which held ten cartridges, or twice as many as the multiple-loading Mausers,&nbsp;Mannlichers, &amp;c.) for emergencies. But from about 1903 this&nbsp;equivalence of infantry weapons began to be disturbed by two&nbsp;new influences: the tendency towards a “ short ” rifle, and&nbsp;the introduction of the pointed bullet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the first, Switzerland took the lead with the short Schmidt-Rubin in 1900. But amongst the greater powers, England and the United States alone have followed her example. At&nbsp;the close of the South African War Great Britain issued&nbsp;1000 short Lee-Enfield rifles experimentally, and in 1903 the&nbsp;“ short rifle ” was actually approved and issued generally.&nbsp;Since then it has been improved in details. The barrel was&nbsp;shortened by 5 in., multiple-loading by charger was introduced,&nbsp;and by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Musketry Regulations</span><span class="font0"> of 1909 magazine fire was&nbsp;laid down as the normal, single-loading being forbidden. The&nbsp;change met with very considerable opposition, especially from&nbsp;target-shooting experts, who maintained that a long rifle, so&nbsp;perfected in details as to be equal to the short in every point&nbsp;except in length, must be more accurate. The view of the&nbsp;military authorities, which was maintained in spite of criticism,&nbsp;was that for service purposes, and especially for prolonged&nbsp;snap-shooting, the handier weapon was preferable. One&nbsp;important factor in the decision was the desire to give the&nbsp;cavalry a weapon with which, when dismounted, it could fight&nbsp;the infantry rifle on equal terms. A more serious objection&nbsp;than that of want of superfine accuracy in bull’s-eye shooting&nbsp;was the loss of 5 in. of reach in bayonet fighting. This objection was met in 1907 by the introduction of a new pattern&nbsp;bayonet with a blade 5 in. longer. In 1908 the long Lee-Enfield and Lee-Metford rifles in store were converted&nbsp;for charger-loading (fig. 3), fitted with safety catches and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The United States in 1904 replaced the Krag-Jorgensen (handloading horizontal magazine) by the short Springfield. A sort of spring bayonet was at first fitted to this rifle, but it was soon&nbsp;replaced by an ordinary sword bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pointed bullet (“ Spitz-geschoss'” or “S”) was introduced hy Germany in 1905, and her example was quickly followed&nbsp;by France (balle D) and other powers. Its advantage is a&nbsp;considerable flattening of the trajectory, chiefly on account&nbsp;of the lessened resistance of the air. This latter allows of a&nbsp;reduction in the sectional density and consequently in the&nbsp;weight of the bullet. Thus velocities up to 2900 foot-seconds&nbsp;are realized, which enables the “ dangerous space ” to be&nbsp;very greatly augmented (see fig. 20). The “ fixed sight ”&nbsp;range with the “ S” bullet is 700 yds., as against the Lee-Enfield’s&nbsp;500. It was announced in the House of Commons in 1910&nbsp;that a modified bullet was being experimented with, and that&nbsp;some increase in the fixed-sight range was expected to be obtained,&nbsp;but the relatively weak breech action of the Lee-Enfield—which&nbsp;is due chiefly to the rearward position of the locking lugs—does&nbsp;not allow designers much freedom in the matter of increasing&nbsp;velocities, as the chamber pressure has to be kept low. It&nbsp;will be seen from the table that other rifles are constructed to&nbsp;stand a much higher pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But both these improvements are destined to be eclipsed in importance by the adoption of the automatic rifle. The&nbsp;application of the automatic principle to the modem high-velocity small-arm of precision has been occupying the attention&nbsp;of the small-arms experts of all armies and of numerous private&nbsp;inventors for some years past. These numerous attempts&nbsp;have, in the case of the rifle, been largely doomed to failure&nbsp;because of the necessary Umitations of space and weight;&nbsp;although the automatic principle has been successfully applied&nbsp;both to machine guns </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> and to pistols </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> In these&nbsp;weapons the work of extracting the empty cartridge-case,&nbsp;re-loading and re-cocking, is accomplished either by the motive&nbsp;power of the recoil or of the gas generated by the explosion&nbsp;of the powder, thus enabling a rapid and continuous fire to be&nbsp;maintained to the fuU capacity of the weapon’s magazine. In&nbsp;the case of machine guns the firing also is automatic, but self-firing&nbsp; rifles are not very desirable as infantry weapons and in&nbsp;addition are so heavy as to approximate to machine guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the recoil-operated class of automatic rifles there are two subdivisions, “ short-recoil ” and “ long-recoil. ” In the&nbsp;former, which is most favoured by inventors, the barrel, body&nbsp;and bolt recoil together for a short distance, about } in., in&nbsp;which space the bolt is unlocked, and the bolt then recoils&nbsp;freely in the body. The bolt is run forward in reloading by&nbsp;a spring. In the long-recoil type the barrel, body and bolt&nbsp;recoil the whole distance, and the barrel and body are run up by&nbsp;one spring, the bolt by another. Several such rifles have been&nbsp;shown at the N.R.A. meetings at Bisley; the Rexer, Mauser and&nbsp;Woodgate rifles being on the long-recoil, the Halle on the short-recoil principle. Gas-operated rifles, like the Hotchkiss and&nbsp;Colt machine guns, have fixed barrels and are worked by a&nbsp;portion of the powder-gases which is allowed to escape from&nbsp;the barrel through a small hole near the muzzle, thence entering&nbsp;a cyUnder and working a piston in connexion with the breech&nbsp;mechanism. No automatic rifle has as yet (August 1910) been&nbsp;issued as a service weapon by any power, the problem of ensuring&nbsp;certainty in action under service conditions—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> with grit and&nbsp;dirt in the working parts—being the principal difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Great Britain.—</span><span class="font0">There are two principal types of Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles in the service, the “ short ” and the “ chargerloading.” The former is carried by all units (cavalry included)&nbsp;of the regular army, by the yeomanry cavalry of the Territorial&nbsp;Force, and by units of the Officers’, Training Corps. The latter is&nbsp;used by the infantry of the Territorial Force. There exist, further,&nbsp;the older, non-charger-loading Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles,&nbsp;a few carbines of the same type, and some Martini-Metford and&nbsp;Martini-Enfield carbines which have the *303 barrel and cartridge&nbsp;with the falling-block Martini action. -45 Martini-Henry rifles and&nbsp;carbines, and even Sniders, are still used by local police forces in&nbsp;some of the smaller colonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “long” charger-loading Lee^Enfield is, converted, from earlier patterns by the, addition of a charger guide, the stripping&nbsp;of the bolt-cover, and improvements in the sighting. The action&nbsp;of the breech mechanism 1 is as follows (the breech mechanism of&nbsp;the “ short ” rifle being practically the same) : The breech is&nbsp;closed by a bolt (I) which slides in a bolt-way cut in the body;&nbsp;the bolt-head (Io) abuts against the base of the cartridge when the&nbsp;rifle is loaded, and when the knob is turned down the whole is locked.&nbsp;On the right side of the bolt is a solid rib, and on the left side a lug;&nbsp;these support the bolt on firing by contact with the “ resisting&nbsp;shoulder ” on the right, and the rear face of the “ lug seating ”&nbsp;on the left of the body. Underneath the bolt there are two recesses&nbsp;and two studs. The bolt-head is screwed to the bolt and is fitted&nbsp;with an extractor claw. The bolt-head, instead of being rigidly&nbsp;attached to the bolt, is so far independent that it remains stationary&nbsp;while the bolt is revolved. Inside the bolt is the arrangement&nbsp;of striker (V) and spring (W), and at its rear end, forming the&nbsp;Working connexion between trigger and striker, is the “ cocking-piece ” (X) which 4s fitted with a safety-catch (not in the old pattern&nbsp;rifle illustrated). This cocking-piece (which cannot turn) has a long&nbsp;tongue projecting to the front, lying along the under side of the&nbsp;bolt, and the front end of this tongue (Y), called the “ full-bent,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The annexed figures show the old pattern weapon. In both the existing patterns a safety catch is fitted, the magazine spring is of&nbsp;a different shape and there is no bolt-cover. But the essential&nbsp;parts of the action remain the same.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
