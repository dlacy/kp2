<p><span class="font0">Rich ſyſtem to be. It would be unhappy, indeed, if, on a compariſon of pure theiſm with polytheiftn, the&nbsp;latter, with all its abſurdities, ſhould be found more beneficial to mankind than the former. Tbe theiſm of&nbsp;the Jews was not formed to be diffeminated through the&nbsp;earth ; that would have been inconſiſtent with the purpofes for which it is ſaid to have been deſigned. But&nbsp;while the Jews were ſeparated by their religion from all&nbsp;other nations, and perhaps, in ſome degree, fixed and&nbsp;rendered ſtationary in their progreſs towards reſine-ment, they were placed in circumſtances, in reſpect to&nbsp;laws, and government, and religion, and moral light,&nbsp;which might with good reaſon render them the envy&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">every other nation in the ancient world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">IV. The Chriſtian religion next demands our attention. It is to be conſidered as an improvement of the Jewiſh, or a new ſuperſtructure raiſed on the ſame baſis. If the effects of the Jewiftt religion were beneficial to thoſe among whom it was eſtabliſhed, they were&nbsp;confined almoſt to them alone. But is the ſpirit of&nbsp;Chriſtianity equally pure and benignant ? Is its influence equally beneficial and more diffuſtve than that of&nbsp;Judaiſm ? Does it really merit to have triumphed over&nbsp;both the theiſm of the Jews and the polytheiſin of the&nbsp;heathens ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we conſider the doctrines and precepts of the Chriſtian religion, nothing can be more happily calculated to raife the dignity of human nature, and promote the&nbsp;happineſs of mankind. The happineſs of the individual&nbsp;is beſt promoted by the exerciſe of love and gratitude&nbsp;towards God, and relignation to his providence ; of&nbsp;humanity, integrity, and good will towards men ; and&nbsp;by the due government βf our appetites and paſſions.&nbsp;Social happineſs again proceeds from the members of ſociety entertaining a diſintereſted regard for the public&nbsp;welfare ; being actively indαftrious each in his proper&nbsp;ſphere of exertion ; and being ſtrictly juſt and faithful,&nbsp;and generouſiy benevolent in their mutual intercourfe.&nbsp;The tenor of the goſpel inculcates theſe virtues ; it&nbsp;feems everywhere through the whole of the Chriſtian&nbsp;code to have been the great deſign of its Author to in-ſpire mankind with mild, benevolent, and peaceable dif-poſitions, and to form them to courteous manners.&nbsp;Chriſtianity again repreſents the Deity and his ∙attri-butes in the faireſt light; even fo as to render our ideas&nbsp;of his nature, and the manner in which he exerts his&nbsp;power, conſiſtent with the moſt correct principles of&nbsp;morality that can be collected from all the other religions that have prevailed in the earth, and from the&nbsp;writings of the moſt admired philoſophers. The ritual&nbsp;obſervances which Chriſtianity enjoins are few in number, eafy to perform, decent, expreſſive, and edifying.&nbsp;It inculcates no duties but what are founded on thé&nbsp;principles of human nature, and on the relation in&nbsp;which men ſtand to God, their Creator, Redeemer, and&nbsp;Sanctifier ; and it preſcribes accurate rules for the regulation of the conduct. The aſſiſtance of the ſpirit&nbsp;of God is promiſed in this ſacred volume to thoſe who&nbsp;aſſiduouſly labour to difcharge the duties which it enjoins ; and it exhibits a ſtriking example of ſpotleſs pu-rity, which we may fafely venture to imitate. The&nbsp;goſpel teaches that worldly afflictions are incident to&nbsp;both good and bad men ; a doctrine highly conducive&nbsp;to virtue, which conſoles us in diſtreſs, prevents deſpair,&nbsp;⅛n∙d encourages us to perſiſt ſirmlv in otιr integrity under every difficulty and trial. Chriſtianſty reprefents&nbsp;all men as children of the fame God, and heirs of the&nbsp;fame ſalvation, and levels all diſtinctions of rich and&nbsp;poor, as accidental and inſigniſicant in the ſight of him&nbsp;who rewards or puniſhes with impartiality according to&nbsp;the merits or demerits of his creatures. This doctrine&nbsp;is highly favourable to virtue, as it tends to humble the&nbsp;proud, and to communicate dignity of ſentiment to thc&nbsp;lowly ; to render princes and inferior magiſtrates mo-derate and juſt, gentle and condeſcending, to their inferiors. It farther requires huſhands to be affectionate&nbsp;and indulgent to their wives, wives to be faithful and&nbsp;reſpectful to their huſhands, and both to be true and&nbsp;conſtant to each other. Such is the purity of the gofpel, that it forbids us even to harbour impure thoughts;&nbsp;it requires us to abandon our vices, however dear to&nbsp;us ; and to the cautious wiſdom of the ſerpent it directs us to join the innocent ſimplicity of the dove.&nbsp;The Chriſtian diſpenſation, to prevent a perſeverance in&nbsp;immorality, offers pardon for the pail, provided the offender forfake his vicious practices, with a firm refolution to act differently in future. The fonctions of the&nbsp;goſpel have a natural tendency to exalt the mind above&nbsp;the paltry purſuits of this world, and to render the&nbsp;Chriſtian incorruptible by wealth, honours, or plea-ſures. The true Chriſtian not only abſtains from in-juſtice towards others, but even forgives thoſe injuries&nbsp;which he himſelf ſuffers, knowing that he cannot otherwiſe hope for forgiveneſs from God. Such are the&nbsp;precepts, ſuch the ſpirit, and ſuch the general tendency&nbsp;of the goſpel. Even thoſe who refuſed to give credit&nbsp;to its doctrines and hiſtory have yet acknowledged the&nbsp;excellence of its precepts. They have acknowledged,&nbsp;that &quot; no religion ever yet appeared in the world of&nbsp;which the natural tendency was ſo much directed to&nbsp;promote the peace and happineſs of mankind as the&nbsp;Chriſtian ; and that the goſpel of Chriſt is one continued leffon of the ſtricteſt morality, of juſtice, benevolence, and univerfol charity.” Thefe are thertvords of&nbsp;Bolingbroke, one of its keeneſt and moſt inſidious op-ponents. without examining the effects of this religion on ſociety, we might almoſt venture to pronounce with confidence, that a religion, the precepts of&nbsp;which are ſo happily formed to promote all that is juſt&nbsp;and excellent, canηot but be in the higheſt degree beneficial to mankind. By reviewing the effects which&nbsp;it has actually produced, the favourable, opinion which&nbsp;we naturally conceive of it, after conſtdering its precepts, cannot but be confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Οηε circumftance we mtiſt take notice of as rather unfavourable to this review. It is really impoffible to&nbsp;do juſtice to Chriſtianity by fuch a diſcuffion of its merits. The virtues which it has a natural tendency to&nbsp;produce and cheriſh in the human heart, are not of a&nbsp;noiſy oſtentatious kind ; they often eſcape the Obſervation of the world. Temperance, gentleneſs, patience,&nbsp;benevolence, juſtice, and general purity of manners, are&nbsp;not the qualities which moſt readily attract the admiration and obtain the applaufe of men. The man of&nbsp;Roſs, whom Mr Pope has ſo juſtly celebrated, was a&nbsp;private character ; his name is nt w likely to live, and&nbsp;his virtues to be known to the lateſt poſterity : aud&nbsp;yet, however diſintereſted his virtues, however beneficial his influence to all around him, had his character&nbsp;not attracted thc notice of that eminent poet, his name</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
