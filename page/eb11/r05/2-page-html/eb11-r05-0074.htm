<p><span class="font1">extent benefit the peasantry. The limited size of their farms, and the necessity for buying wood and paying for pasturage, both of&nbsp;which were formerly free, prevented them from obtaining complete&nbsp;independence of the large proprietors, on whose estates they still&nbsp;had to work for payment in money or kind, while their improvidence&nbsp;soon got them into the hands of Jewish money-lenders, who, fortunately for the peasants, were by law unable to become proprietors of&nbsp;the soil. In 1866 and 1872 laws were passed for still further improving the position of these small proprietors; and in 1879 a measure&nbsp;was carried for allotting lands to 48,000 recently married couples,&nbsp;and for restoring to many peasant families lands which had been&nbsp;alienated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the Land Act of 1889, the state domains, amounting to nearly one-third of the total area of Rumania (originally the property of the&nbsp;church and the convents, confiscated by Prince Cuza in 1866), were&nbsp;distributed among the peasantry. The land was divided into lots&nbsp;of 12 1/2, 25 and 37 1/2 acres. Peasants having no land might purchase&nbsp;the smaller lots on very easy terms. Those who already held less&nbsp;than I2i acres might purchase up to that amount. When a change&nbsp;of residence became necessary to enable the peasant to take up the&nbsp;new allotment, the state advanced £6 to each family to defray&nbsp;expenses. The price to be paid for the land differed in different&nbsp;districts, and was to be paid to the state in small annual instalments.&nbsp;If any land remained after satisfying the wants of the peasants, it&nbsp;was to be sold by public auction in lots of 50 to 62 1/2 acres. All lots&nbsp;in both cases were declared inalienable for thirty years. The sale of&nbsp;the larger lots gave rise to so many abuses that in 1896 a law was&nbsp;passed abolishing their further sale. As a result of these measures&nbsp;the majority of Rumans are peasant proprietors; but the smallness&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the holdings renders scientific farming difficult except by cooperation, and many proprietors can only live by working for the&nbsp;owners of large estates. Thus, though the average value of agricultural land increased by 60% between 1870 and 1900, the position&nbsp;of the peasantry is far from satisfactory, and the resultant discontent was the chief cause of the agrarian rising in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fisheries.—</span><span class="font1">Among European freshwater fishing-grounds, the Danube is only surpassed by the Volga; the most valuable fish being&nbsp;sturgeon and sterlet, mostly netted in the St George mouth; carp,&nbsp;often weighing 50 lb; pike, perch, tench and eels. By an act of&nbsp;1895, a close period was instituted, the lakes and rivers restocked,&nbsp;and the state fisheries, which are either farmed by private companies&nbsp;or directly administered, were set in order. The coarse-grained grey&nbsp;Rumanian caviare is forwarded to Berlin, and there blended with&nbsp;Russian caviare. Flounders and mullet are caught in the Black&nbsp;Sea, and there are oyster-beds in the delta and on the Dobrudja&nbsp;littoral. The principal markets for Rumanian fish are Turkey,&nbsp;Russia and Austria-Hungary. Fish of inferior quality is imported,&nbsp;chiefly from Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manufactures and Commerce.—</span><span class="font1">The native mines, fields and forests provide raw material for most of. the few factories, which&nbsp;exist. These include petroleum refineries, iron foundries, distilleries,&nbsp;flour mills, sugar refineries, sawmills, paper mills, chemical works,&nbsp;glass works, soap and candle works, &amp;c. A law. passed in 1887&nbsp;provided that any one undertaking to found an industrial establishment with a capital of at least £2000, or employing at least&nbsp;25 workmen (of whom two-thirds should be Rumanians), should be&nbsp;granted 12 acres of state land, exemption for a term of years from&nbsp;all direct taxes, freedom from customs dues for machinery and raw&nbsp;material imported, exemption from road taxes, reduction in.cost&nbsp;of carriage of materials on the state railways, and preferential rights&nbsp;to the supply of manufactured articles to the state.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">The principal imports are metals and machinery (£5,510,000 in 1908), textiles, silk, wool, hair and hides. Grain (£11,297,000 in&nbsp;1908), petroleum (£1,543,000) and timber (£1,059,000) are by far&nbsp;the most important exports, the remainder consisting of live-stock&nbsp;the animal products, fruit, vegetables and mineral waters. In&nbsp;1908 the chief Consumers of Rumanian goods were (in order) Belgium,&nbsp;Great Britain and Italy; the chief exporters to Rumania were&nbsp;Germany, Austria-Hungary, Great Britain and France. The wide&nbsp;fluctuations in Rumanian commerce are largely due to the dependence of the country on the grain harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Finance.—</span><span class="font1">The state, revenue is derived from customs; from public works and public land; from indirect taxes in the shape of&nbsp;stamp, inheritance, beer, spirit, petroleum and other duties; from&nbsp;direct taxes on land and buildings, with road-tolls, licences for the&nbsp;sale of alcohol and traders' registration fees; from the tobacco,&nbsp;salt, match, playing-card and cigarette-paper monopolies; and from&nbsp;the postal, telegraphic and telephonic services. The chief items&nbsp;of expenditure are interest on the national debt, and the cost of&nbsp;defence, public works and education.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">The great increase after 1907-8 is due to the inclusion of railway receipts and expenditure, with some other items not previously&nbsp;enumerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In May 1905 the outstanding public debt, which amounted to about £54,000,000, mainly placed in Germany and bearing interest&nbsp;at an average rate of 5 %, was converted into a uniform 4 % stock.&nbsp;Besides this reduction of interest, the state secured an extension&nbsp;of fourteen years in each of the various periods allotted for repayment&nbsp;of the component loans. But a considerable increase in the total&nbsp;debt was involved, because a bonus of 10 1/2% in new 4% stock,&nbsp;issued at par, was offered to induce bondholders to convert, while,&nbsp;to cover the bonus, an additional 4% loan was riased at 90-70,&nbsp;amounting to £4,000,000, redeemable in 1945. At the beginning&nbsp;of the fiscal year 1909-10 (March 31st, O.S.) the total outstanding&nbsp;debt was £58,367,000, and the debt charges for the year were&nbsp;estimated at £3,518,080.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banks and Currency.—</span><span class="font1">Apart from the General Bank of Rumania (capital £200,000), which is owned by a syndicate mainly of Germans,&nbsp;the largest credit Cstablishmtmts belong to the state. They include&nbsp;the National Bank (capital and reserves in 1910, £1,560,000), founded&nbsp;in 1880; the Agricultural Loan Bank, founded in 1894; the Rural&nbsp;and Urban Land Credit Institutes, which lend money on agricultural&nbsp;and building land respectively; the Cassa Rurala, which buys&nbsp;estates for resale in small lots; savings banks in all the principal&nbsp;towns; and the Deposit and Trust Fund, which takes charge of&nbsp;estates left vacant through intestacy, surplus departmental and&nbsp;communal funds, securities given by contractors for public works,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the Crimean War, a bimetallic currency was adopted, with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leu</span><span class="font1"> (franc) of 100 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bani</span><span class="font1"> (centimes) as the unit of value. But&nbsp;after 1878 the Russian silver rouble was rated so highly as to drive the&nbsp;native coins out of circulation; and in 1889 Rumania joined the Latin&nbsp;Monetary Union and adopted a gold standard. Besides the silver&nbsp;pieces worth 1/2, 1, 2 and 5 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lei,</span><span class="font1"> gold coins of 5, 10 and 20 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lei</span><span class="font1"> are used.&nbsp;Silver is legal tender only up to 50 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leu</span><span class="font1"> All taxes and customs dues&nbsp;must be paid in gold, and, owing to the small quantities issued from&nbsp;the Rumanian mint, foreign gold is current, especially French&nbsp;20-franc pieces (equal at par to 20 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">let),</span><span class="font1"> Turkish gold </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lire</span><span class="font1"> (22-70),&nbsp;Old Russian Imperials (20-60) and English sovereigns of (25-22).&nbsp;Besides bronze coins of less value than 1/2 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leu,</span><span class="font1"> nickel pieces worth 5,&nbsp;10 and 20 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bani</span><span class="font1"> were authorized by a law of 1900. The French&nbsp;decimal system is in use for weights and measures, together with&nbsp;Turkish standards. On the railways and in post offices the Gregorian&nbsp;calendar is employed; elsewhere the Julian remains in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chief Towns.—</span><span class="font1">The chief towns, with their estimated population in 1910, are Bucharest, the capital (300,000); Jassy, the capital of&nbsp;Moldavia (80,000) ; Galatz (66,000), Braila (60,000), Ploesci (50,000),&nbsp;Craiova (46,000), Botoshani (34,000), Bêrlad (25,000), Focshani&nbsp;(25,000), Tulcea (20,000), Constantza (16,000), Giurgevo (15,000).&nbsp;Other towns which,, like the foregoing, are described in separate&nbsp;articles are Alexandria, Babadag, Bacau, Buzeu, Calafat, Calarashi,&nbsp;Câmpulung, Caracal, Curtea de Argesh, Dorohoi, Dragashani,&nbsp;Falticeni, Hushi, Mangalia, Neamtzu, Oltenitza, Piatra, Pitesci,&nbsp;Ramnicu Särat, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Roman, Sinaia, Sulina, Tîrgu&nbsp;Jiu, Tîrgu Ocna, Tirgovishtea, Tecuci, Turnu Magurele, Turnu&nbsp;Severin and Vaslui.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Communications.—</span><span class="font1">Until the 19th century, traffic was carried on in Rumania chiefly by means of ox-wagons, over the roughest of&nbsp;roads. After 1830, however, many highways were opened, these&nbsp;being usually excellent among the mountains but deteriorating as&nbsp;they descend into the lowlands, where stone is dear. Highways&nbsp;are maintained by the state, department or commune, according&nbsp;to their size and importance. In 1869, the first Rumanian railway&nbsp;was opened, between Bucharest and Giurgevo, its port. Other lines&nbsp;followed rapidly; some built by private enterprise, others by the&nbsp;state, which by 1888 had bought the entire system. This centres&nbsp;in one main line, carried southwards from Suczawa in Bukovina&nbsp;through the whole length of Moldavia, and turning westwards&nbsp;through Walachia to meet the Hungarian frontier at Verciorova.&nbsp;Branch lines extend, on one side, up the lateral valleys of the&nbsp;Carpathians, and, on the other, to Jassy and the principal Danubian&nbsp;ports. A direct line connects Jassy with Galatz; another traverses&nbsp;the Dobrudia from Constantza to Cernavoda, where it crosses the&nbsp;Danube and proceeds north-west to join the main line. The double&nbsp;bridge of Cernavoda, with the viaducts leading to it, stretches for&nbsp;12 1/2 m. across the river and surrounding marshes. Besides the&nbsp;junctions at. Suczawa and Verciorova, the Rumania system meets&nbsp;the Hungarian through the Gyimes, Rothenthurm and Vulkan&nbsp;Passes; the Russian by lines from Jassy and Galatz to Kishinev&nbsp;in Bessarabia; the Bulgarian and Servian by means of numerous</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
