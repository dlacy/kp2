<p><span class="font1">The greatest movement that has occurred in later times was that which substituted for the didactic materialism&nbsp;of the 18th century the new romanticism of the 19th,&nbsp;the leaders of which movement, Coleridge and Scott,&nbsp;were admirably followed by Byron, Shelley, and Keats.&nbsp;Not that Wordsworth was a stranger to the romantic&nbsp;temper. The magnificent image of Time and Death&nbsp;under the yew tree is worthy of any romantic poet that&nbsp;ever lived, yet it cannot be said that he escaped save&nbsp;at moments from the comfortable 18th-century didactics,&nbsp;or that he was a spiritual writer in the sense that&nbsp;Coleridge, Blake, and Shelley were spiritual writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the true romantic feeling, the ever present apprehension of the spiritual world and of that struggle of the soul with earthly conditions which we have before spoken of,&nbsp;Rossetti’s poetry is as full as his pictures—so full indeed&nbsp;that it was misunderstood by certain critics, who found in&nbsp;the most spiritualistic of poets and painters the founder of&nbsp;a “ fleshly school.” Although it cannot be said that&nbsp;“ The Blessed Damozel ” or “ Sister Helen ” or “ Rose&nbsp;Mary” reaches to the height of the masterpieces of Coleridge,&nbsp;the purely romantic temper was with Rossetti a more permanent and even a more natural temper than with any other&nbsp;19th-century poet, even Includingtheauthorof “Christabel”&nbsp;himself. As to the other 19th-century poets, though the&nbsp;Ettrick Shepherd in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Queen’s Wake</span><span class="font1"> shows plenty of&nbsp;the true feeling, Hogg’s verbosity is too great to allow of&nbsp;really successful work in the field of romantic ballad,&nbsp;where concentrated energy is one of the first requisites.&nbsp;And even Dobell’s “ Keith of Ravelston ” has hardly been&nbsp;fused in the fine atmosphere of fairy land. Byron’s&nbsp;“ footlight bogies ” and Shelley’s metaphysical abstractions&nbsp;had of course but very little to do with the inner core&nbsp;of romance, and we have only to consider Keats, to whose&nbsp;“ La Belle Dame sans Merci” and “ Eve of St Mark ”&nbsp;Rossetti always acknowledged himself to be deeply indebted. In the famous close of the seventh stanza of the&nbsp;“ Ode to a Nightingale ”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Charmed magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">there is of course the true thrill of the poetry of wonder, and it is expressed with a music, a startling magic,&nbsp;above the highest reaches of Rossetti’s poetry. But, without the evidence of Keats’s two late poems, “ La Belle&nbsp;Dame sans Merci ” and the “ Eve of St Mark,” who could&nbsp;have said that Keats showed more than a passing apprehension of that which is the basis of the romantic temper&nbsp;—the supernatural? In contrasting Keats with Rossetti&nbsp;it must always be remembered that Keats’s power over the&nbsp;poetry of wonder came to him at one flash, and that it&nbsp;was not (as we have said elsewhere) “ till late in his brief&nbsp;life that his bark was running full sail for the enchanted&nbsp;isle where the old ballad writers once sang and where&nbsp;now sate the wizard Coleridge alone.” Though outside&nbsp;Coleridge’s work there had been nothing in the poetry of&nbsp;wonder comparable with Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans&nbsp;Merci,” he had previously in “ Lamia ” entirely failed&nbsp;in rendering the romantic idea of beauty as a maleficent power. The reader, owing to the atmosphere surrounding the dramatic action being entirely classic, does&nbsp;not believe for a moment in the serpent woman. The&nbsp;classic accessories suggested by Burton’s brief narrative hampered Keats where to Rossetti (as we see in&nbsp;“ Pandora,” “ Cassandra,” and “ Troy Town ”) they would&nbsp;simply have given birth to romantic ideas. It is perhaps&nbsp;with Coleridge alone that Rossetti can be compared as a&nbsp;worker in the Renascence of Wonder. Although his&nbsp;apparent lack of rhythmic spontaneity places him below&nbsp;the great master as a singer (for in these miracles of&nbsp;Coleridge’s genius poetry ceases to appear as a fine art at all&nbsp;—it is the inspired song of the changeling child “ singing,&nbsp;dancing to itself ”), in permanence of the romantic feeling,&nbsp;in vitality of belief in the power of the unseen, Rossetti&nbsp;stands alone. Even the finest portions of his historical&nbsp;ballad “ The King’s Tragedy ” are those which deal with&nbsp;the supernatural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the spring of 1860 Rossetti married Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, who being very beautiful was constantly&nbsp;painted and drawn by him. She had one still-born child&nbsp;in 1861, and died in February 1862. Mrs Rossetti’s own&nbsp;water-colour designs show an extraordinary genius for&nbsp;invention and a rare instinct for colour. He felt her&nbsp;death so acutely that in the first paroxysm of his grief he&nbsp;insisted upon his poems (then in manuscript) being buried&nbsp;with her. These were at a later period recovered, however, and from this time to his death he continued to&nbsp;write poems and produce pictures,—in the latter relying&nbsp;more and more upon his manipulative skill but exercising&nbsp;less and less,—for the reasons above mentioned,—his&nbsp;exhaustless faculty of invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About 1868 the curse of the artistic and poetic temperament, insomnia, attacked him. One of the most distressing effects of this malady is a nervous shrinking from personal contact with any save a few intimate and constantly seen friends. This peculiar kind of nervousness&nbsp;may be aggravated by the use of narcotics, and in his case&nbsp;was aggravated to a very painful degree ; at one time&nbsp;he saw scarcely any one save his own family and immediate family connexions and the present writer. During&nbsp;the time that his second volume of original poetry, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ballads&nbsp;and Sonnets,</span><span class="font1"> was passingthrough the press (in 1881) his&nbsp;health began to give way, and he left London for Cumberland. A stay of a few weeks in the Vale of St John, however, did nothing to improve his health, and he returned&nbsp;much shattered. He then went to Birchington-on-Sea,&nbsp;but received no benefit from the change, and, gradually&nbsp;sinking from a complication of disorders, he died on Sunday&nbsp;the 9th April 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all matters of taste Rossetti’s influence has been immense. The purely decorative arts he may be said to have rejuvenated directly or indirectly. And it is doubtful&nbsp;whether any other Victorian poet has left so deep an impression upon the poetic methods of his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the most wonderful of Rossetti’s endowments, however, was neither of a literary nor an artistic kind : it&nbsp;was that of a rare and most winning personality which&nbsp;attracted towards itself, as if by an unconscious magnetism,&nbsp;the love of all his friends, the love, indeed, of all who&nbsp;knew him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSSINI, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gioachino Antonio</span><span class="font1"> (1792-1868), Italian dramatic composer, was born at Pesaro, February 29, 1792.&nbsp;He first studied music under Angelo Tesei, and that so&nbsp;successfully that he was able to sing solos in church when&nbsp;only ten years old, and three years later to appear at the&nbsp;opera house as Adolfo, in Paer’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camilla.</span><span class="font1"> He was next&nbsp;placed under a retired tenor, named Babbini, and on the&nbsp;breaking of his voice he entered the Liceo at Bologna for&nbsp;the purpose of studying counterpoint under Mattel. On&nbsp;his departure from the school, Mattei, who was not pleased&nbsp;with his progress, told him that he knew enough counterpoint to enable him to write in the free style, but that he&nbsp;was quite unfit for the composition of church music. “ Do&nbsp;I know enough to write operas?” asked Rossini. “ Quite&nbsp;enough,” was the reply. “ Then,” said the boy, “Icare to&nbsp;know no more.” But in truth his wonderful instinct had&nbsp;taught him a great deal more than either he or Mattei&nbsp;suspected.
