<p><span class="font5">Unites and mingles with the mighty maſs :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hence men and beaſts the breath of life obtain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And birds of air, and monſters of the main ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ethereal vigour is in all the ſame,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And every foul is fill’d with equal flame ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As much as earthy limbs, and groſs allay &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ί</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Beſides this hypotheſis, that in ſome meaſure was common to others, Plato had an argument peculiarly&nbsp;his own. Happening to peep into the region of me-t&lt;ιphyfics, he was ſomewhat ſurpriſed on obſerving the&nbsp;ideas which we derive from reflection and conſciouſneſs;&nbsp;and ſuppoſing that they could not have entered by the&nbsp;ſenſes, he naturally, though not very juſtly, concluded,&nbsp;that we muſt have received them in ſome ſtate of prior&nbsp;exiſtence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As, according to him, the foul was eternal, as well as the matter which compoſed the body, and as thcir&nbsp;union was only temporary and accidental, he might&nbsp;have been ſatisfied that the death of the ſoul was not&nbsp;to be the conſequence of their ſeparation. But, ſome&nbsp;how or other, ſatisfied he was not. He had recourſe to&nbsp;a new argument. As the ſoul, he faid, was an active&nbsp;principle, and a ſelf-moving, it did not depend for its&nbsp;life on another ; and therefore would always continue to&nbsp;exiſt, though the body were reduced to the general&nbsp;mafs out of which it was formed. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Metaphysics,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Part III. chap. iv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">whether Plato had borrowed any of his doctrines from the eaſtern magi, we pretend not to fay. AVe on-ly obferve a ſtriking limilarity, in fome reſpects, between&nbsp;his and theirs. In Plato’s philoſophy, the ſun, moon,&nbsp;and ſtars, were animated beings, and a fort of divinities&nbsp;that originally had ſprung from the great fountain of&nbsp;Jιeat.and light, and our earthly bodies a fort of dungeons in which our miferable fouls are benighted and&nbsp;debafed by deſires, appetites, and paſſions. In the ma-.gian philoſophy, the Supreme Being was called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oromaſ-■des ;</span><span class="font5"> was the god of light, or was light itſelf, and re-preſented by Mithras, a ſubordinate divinity, and the&nbsp;ſame with the fun. Another deity of very great power&nbsp;was Arimanes, the god of darkneſs, who preſided over&nbsp;matter, and was the origin of all evil (ſee </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polytheism).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ancient Gndſtics, who derived their tenets from this fource, believed, with Pythagoras and Plato, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">great number of ſubordinate genii ; and ſaid, that De-miurgus, the god of matter and the ſoul or ſpirit of this&nbsp;world, had contrived the bodies of men and brutes; and&nbsp;in the former particularly, as in fo many priſons, had&nbsp;confined </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font5">number of celeſtial ſpirits, that by expofing&nbsp;them to the low deſires of appetite and paſſion, he&nbsp;might feduce them from their allegiance to the God of&nbsp;light, and render them more fubmiſſive to himſelf.&nbsp;From theſe priſons the Supreme Being was continually&nbsp;making attempts to reſcue them; and in the mean&nbsp;time was frequently fending divine meffengers to en-lighten and inſtruct them, and to render them capable&nbsp;oſ returning to the regions of light and happineſs, to&nbsp;which they had belonged </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(e).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Γhe Stoics attempted to ſimplify this ſyſtem, which appears anciently to have pervaded Egypt and the eaſt,&nbsp;and which would ſecm to be no more than variouſly&nbsp;modified by orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, and others of&nbsp;the more northerly and weſtern nations. None of them&nbsp;allowed a creation out of nothing; and the ſhapingand&nbsp;modelling of matter into forms was variouſiy explained,&nbsp;according as they happened to be moſt addicted to ſuperſtition, to morals, or to phyfics. Some afcribed theſe&nbsp;operations to ancient Time, Chaos, and Darkneſs, and&nbsp;explained the future changes in nature by the genealo-gies of theſe deities ; ſome obferving attraction and&nbsp;repulſion, or at leaſt a fort of agreement and diſcor-dance among bodies, were inclined to afcribe them to&nbsp;Friendſhip and Hatred, or Love and Antipathy ; ſome&nbsp;obſerving, that while one body roſe another defcended,&nbsp;made Levity and Gravity primary agents ; and ſome&nbsp;taking notice that living bodies ſprung from corruption,&nbsp;were diſpoſed to confer the ſame powers on Moiſture&nbsp;and Heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The phyfical hypotheſes were what had moſt charms for the Stoics. From their ſyſtem immaterial beings&nbsp;were openly excluded ; all things were regulated by&nbsp;phyfical laws or inexorable fate ; and all things origi-nated in the To 'Ey or the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Firβ One,</span><span class="font5"> which was probably&nbsp;ſuggeſted by the of Pythagoras. This <sup>l o</sup> '<sup>e</sup>&gt;<sup>,</sup> ap-pears to have been a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">materia prima</span><span class="font5"> devoid of all the&nbsp;qualities of body. In their language it was an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">^ρχ<sup>n</sup></span><span class="font5">  or&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">βrβ principle,</span><span class="font5"> not ſubject to change, when it was inveſted with the properties of body, it then became</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(e)</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plato made the ſtars the native reſidence of inferior ſouls; and when theſe were thoroughly purified below,&nbsp;returned them home again : and therefore, ſays virgil, alluding to his doctrine,</span></p>
