He visited England and painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III., now in the Museum, Amsterdam, is a good example. In this work he shows an effect of candle-light, which he also introduced— frequently with fine effect—in many of his subject-pictures. These may be studied in the collections at Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna, and Dresden. He executed several Scriptural subjects—such as that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, at Munich—of very indifferent merit. He died at The Hague in 1706.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
