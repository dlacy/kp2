<p><span class="font1">Mountain, by means of whom Robefpierre had riſen to power, with little ſatisſaction now found themſelves&nbsp;not only difregarded, ſhut ready at every inſtant to fall&nbsp;a ſacrifice to that ſyſtem oſ terror which they had contributed to erect. Even the Jacobins ſhemſelves, though&nbsp;neither timid nor cautious in the ſhedding of blood, be-gan to murmur when they ſaw that awful privilege confined excluſively within a few hands, or rather monopolized by an individual. In this, ſtate things remained&nbsp;for ſome time;, and it appeared how poffible it is for an&nbsp;individual to govern a great nation even while the whole&nbsp;of that nation is hoſtile to his power. The baniſhment&nbsp;or imprifonment of all foreigners, which had long been&nbsp;rigorouſſy practiſed, prevents us from poffeffing much&nbsp;accurate information concerning the internal ſtate of&nbsp;France at this period ; but it is certain, that one eircumftance in particular tendëd much to accelerate the fall&nbsp;of Robefpierre.. He had procured a decree to be paffed,&nbsp;authoriſing the committee of public ſafety to impriſon&nbsp;at its pleaſure, and bring to trial, any member oſ the&nbsp;convention. All the individuals of that body found&nbsp;themſelves placed by this decree in the hands oſ a man&nbsp;wlioſe ſevere and ſuſpicious temper they well knew.&nbsp;Still, however, they were ſo much ſurrounded’by ſpies,&nbsp;that it was difficult to form a party or plan oſ operations ; even the majority oſ the committee of public ſaſety were among the number oſ the diſcontented, but they&nbsp;dared not to withſtand their chief.. At laſt, on the 25th&nbsp;of July, the convention began to exhibit ſigns of agita-tion.. It was underſtood, that in the conrſe oſ a few&nbsp;day# Robefpierre would ſacriſice a number oſ the mem-bers to his ſuſpicions. On the following day the ſitting&nbsp;of the convention was ſtill more tempeſtuous. In a. long&nbsp;ſpeech Robefpierre defended his own conduct againſt&nbsp;thoſe who had reproached him with aſpiring to the dic-tatorfllip of France. He attacked the party whom he&nbsp;ſtyled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moderates,</span><span class="font1"> as. wiſhing ,to overturn the revolutionary government^ and to reſtore the feeble ſyſtem of the&nbsp;Briffotinesi The reſult of a long debate was, that Ro-beſpierre was apparently victorious, and his ſpeech was-ordered to be printed. On the 27th the convention,&nbsp;appeared ripe for a change : St Juſt, a member of the&nbsp;committee of public ſafety, in attempting to defend&nbsp;Robefpierre,. was repeatedly interrupted; and Billaud&nbsp;Varrennes ſtood forward and enumerated the crimes,&nbsp;and proclaimed the tyranny, of Robefpierre. The&nbsp;ſpeech was received with burſts of applauſe. Robe-ſpierre in vain attempted to defend himſelf ; he was&nbsp;filenced by ſhouts ©f execration from every part of the&nbsp;hall. Tallien ſeconded the former ſpeaker in . his ac-cuſation. The ſitting was declared permanent, and a&nbsp;decree of arreſt was paffed againſt Robefpierre and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">younger brother of his, along with St Juſt, Couthon,&nbsp;and Lebas. Theſe men left the convention, and found?&nbsp;ſecurity in the hall of the commune of Paris ; where&nbsp;the municipal officers agreed to protect and ſtand by&nbsp;them. The tocſin was founded ; the armed force was&nbsp;under their command ; an infurrection was therefore&nbsp;attempted againſt the convention : but the ſections of&nbsp;Paris reſuſed their ſupport. Very few ef the troops·&nbsp;could be collected^ and thefe were, not ſirm ; the late&nbsp;tyranny had become odious. The hall of the commune&nbsp;was thereforeſpeedilyſurrounded; and about three o’clock&nbsp;in the morning of the 28th Robefpierre and his affoci</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ates were made priſoners.« They had been· outlawed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">convention on account of </span><span class="font1">their reſlſtance. They were not therefore tried, unleft for the purpoſe of identifying their perſons ; and, in the courſe of that day,&nbsp;they were executed : 60 of the municipal officers were&nbsp;alſo executed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font1"> joining in their rebellion ; and in this&nbsp;way </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">ſtorm paſſed over, which at one time threatened&nbsp;to involve the French capital in ruin, and ſilled all Eu-rope with aſtoniſhment. Thus alſo terminated the career of the moſt extraordinary man that the French revolution had brought forward. His talents were undoubtedly confide rable, and his ambition knew no bounds^&nbsp;bidding defiance to the ordinary feelings of humanity.&nbsp;Had Dumourier poſſeſſed his eoolneis and caution, or&nbsp;had lie poſſeffed the military talents of Dumourier, the&nbsp;convention would certainly have been overturned, and&nbsp;we ſhoul'd have ſeen a ſecond Cromwell on tile throne of&nbsp;his murdered ſovereign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the fall of Robeſpierre, the convention exhi-bited no ſmall change of appearance. Inſtead of that ſilence which formerly prevailed, all was buſtle and&nbsp;noiſe all accuſed each other. There was no longer&nbsp;any leader, and there was no formed party. Ί he foimer&nbsp;ſyſtem of terror was declared to be at an end, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">new ſyſtem of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">moderatiſm</span><span class="font1"> ſucceeded. This was carried&nbsp;to as great a height as tile fyſtem of terror had formerly been ; and all means were taken to render popular&nbsp;the fall of their late tyrant. The committees were or- ■&nbsp;ganiſed anew, and their members ordered to be frequently changed. The correſpondence between the affiliated Jacobin clubs was prohibited, and at laſt the&nbsp;Jacobin club itſelf was aboliſhed. This laſt event was&nbsp;accompliſhed with eaſe ; and that ſociety which had&nbsp;been the great engine of the revolution, was itſelf without reſiſtance overturned. Seventy-one deputies of the&nbsp;Girondiſt party, who had been imprifoned ſince the 31ft&nbsp;of May 1793, were ſet at liberty. The name of Lyons&nbsp;was reſtored to it. Some of the agents of Robeſpierre&nbsp;were puniſhed, particularly the infamous Carrier, whoſe&nbsp;cruelties in La Vendee we formerly mentioned. Still,&nbsp;however, the convention appeared ſo little united and&nbsp;fo little decided with regard to objects of the ſirſt im~&nbsp;portance, that in all probability they would not have&nbsp;conducted tlie important ſtruggle againſt the nations&nbsp;of Europe witli more ſucceſs than the Girondiſt party&nbsp;had formerly done, if the revolutionary government&nbsp;and the late fyſtem of terror had not already accumulated in their hands ſuch vaſt reſources, and traced out&nbsp;ſuch a plan of procedure, as rendered it an eaſy matter&nbsp;to preſerve their numerous armies in the train of ſuc~&nbsp;ceſs to which they were now habituated, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The allies in their retreat had left, ſtrang .garriſons in the French towns which had ſurrendered to them.&nbsp;Theſe were.Condé, Valenciennes, Queſnoi, and Lan-drecies. They now ſurrendered. to the republican ar-mies with ſo little reſiſtance, tliat the conduct of the emperor began to be-conſidered as ambiguous, and· he was&nbsp;ſuſpected of having entered · into ſome kind of com-promiſe with the French. This idea proved erroneous;&nbsp;and as ſuon as the army which had beſieged theſe towns&nbsp;was able to join the grand army under Pichegru ancl&nbsp;Jourdan, the. operations oſ the campaign were reſumed&nbsp;aſter a ſuſpenſion of almoſt two months.
