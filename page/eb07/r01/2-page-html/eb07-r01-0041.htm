<p><span class="font0">The sliding rail, which forms the communication from one line of rails to the other, and which is moved by an eccentric,&nbsp;turned by a lever handle, should have, on the other side of&nbsp;the line, an iron rod from the rail, going into a box at its end&nbsp;with a pinion on it. This pinioned end of the rod turns a&nbsp;rack when the sliding rail is moved, which rack is contained&nbsp;in the box, and is fixed to a vertical rod, moveable in an upright post, similar to a lamp post, through the top of which,&nbsp;about four feet in height, the upper end of the rod comes out&nbsp;for about six inches, and is in this part made square. On this&nbsp;square part there is put a lamp by night, to shew a white light&nbsp;when the points are right, and a red one when they are&nbsp;wrong ; so that whenever the sliding rail is moved, it of necessity turns the light round, and cannot fail to place the&nbsp;different colours in front of the line of rails to which the&nbsp;signal is meant to apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the day time the lamp is removed from the square, which, however, is not necessary, and the same signal is made&nbsp;visible by two circular hoops covered with canvass, one being&nbsp;painted red and the other white, and one being fixed on the top&nbsp;of the other at right angles to it ; or the hoops may be one inside the other, at the same height and at right angles, nothing more being necessary than that the signal should be&nbsp;such that when combined in this way, the sliding rail can&nbsp;never move without the signal also moving, which should&nbsp;shew white when the points are right, and red when they&nbsp;are wrong. These things, however, will never be properly&nbsp;correct till the engine itself is made to turn the points, which&nbsp;has often been tried, and is considered as having tailed, but&nbsp;may certainly be done with ease and effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Self-acting alarms, with gong-shaped bells standing upright and fixed about twelve feet high to a wall, should be supplied to each station, and they should be wound up by men&nbsp;stationed at them, who may also act as policemen. These&nbsp;alarms are for the purpose of giving notice to the station-people of the arrival of a train. Two minutes are sufficient&nbsp;time in ordinary cases, and, with active men, one would&nbsp;suffice, and proper regulations must be established to ensure this space of time. On the train arriving at the proper spot, the man stationed at the alarm pulls a trigger,&nbsp;which allows a weight to descend. This turns a wheel, and&nbsp;this wheel works a pinion, to which is attached an eccentric, which gives motion to the clapper from side to side,&nbsp;and the alarm is struck by the hammer in the usual way,&nbsp;the man stationed at it being at liberty to attend to any&nbsp;other business the instant he has pulled the string. A large&nbsp;station-bell is also useful to summon all the persons to their&nbsp;posts at unusual times, in order to receive any unexpected trains, and for many other reasons. A bell should also&nbsp;run from the station office at the out-stations, to summon&nbsp;one or more porters inside the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A good means of preventing accidents would be, to have the engine-man in the front of the engine. If any thingcould&nbsp;ensure care, this would, the generality of engine-men being&nbsp;quite foolhardy ; a defect which will never be remedied till&nbsp;we have a distinct class of men educated and brought up&nbsp;for engine-men from their youth, to whom should be given&nbsp;such a salary as would bring in young men Ofrespectability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Plate CCCCXXV, fig. 3, we have given a plan of an invalid carriage, capable of containing four invalids and their&nbsp;four attendants, (α, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a)</span><span class="font0"> are the seats for the passengers, one&nbsp;on each side of the firεt and second bodies of the carriage&nbsp;being for the invalid, and the opposite one, lengthways of&nbsp;the carriage, being for the attendants When the invalid&nbsp;wishes for the use of the closet, he comes out by the door&nbsp;(Z&gt;) into the middle part of the coach (&lt;∕), which is a gallery&nbsp;with a raised roof, as in fig. 2. There are three portable water-closets </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font0"> in this carriage, or the middle one, if thought&nbsp;more desirable, may be merely an urinal ; the centre one,&nbsp;to whatever purpose it may be converted, is arrived at from&nbsp;the gallery by the door (c), and the right and left-hand clo-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">sets by the doors </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jg) (fg)</span><span class="font0"> respectively. The ventilation here would be very perfect, and no inconvenience whatever'&nbsp;could arise to any one of the passengers. An attendant belonging to the railway company could attend on all the passengers remaining in the gallery </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font0"> till his assistance was&nbsp;required, for which purpose a bell might be hung with pulls&nbsp;in each compartment. By this arrangement double the&nbsp;number of invalids could in each case be accommodated&nbsp;with a passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following are the engines in use on the London and j Birmingham railway, and which were made by Mr. Bury oft&nbsp;Liverpool. The description here given applies to both thef&nbsp;passenger and goods’ engines, except when otherwise&nbsp;stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The two cylinders are to have an l8-inch stroke, those of the passenger engines being 12 inches, and the goods’ engines 13 inches in diameter, with single slide valves, brass&nbsp;spring pistons, and cast iron packing ; the cover of each cylinder having one oil.cup., The boilers are made of the best&nbsp;YorkshireplatesjeitherBowlingorLowmoor. The fire-boxes&nbsp;are of the same material, and are welded so as not to have&nbsp;the rivets or lap exposed immediately to the action of the&nbsp;fire. They are 3-8ths of an inch thick, the back plates half&nbsp;an inch, the outside of the fire-box and the backplate 3-8ths&nbsp;of an inch, and the rest of the boiler <sub>1</sub>⅞ths of an inch. Full-sized drawings are furnished to shew how the plates are to&nbsp;be worked ; the plate for the tubes at the smoke-box end is&nbsp;half an inch thick, and a lead plug, 5-8ths of an inch in diameter, is riveted in the crown of the fire-box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tubes are two inches indiameterinside,andare secured with steel hoops at the fire-box end, and iron hoops at the chimney end. These hoops are made to a given guage ;&nbsp;and the tubes are of the best rolled brass, No. 14 wire guage&nbsp;thick ; the arrangement as well as the exact size of the&nbsp;tubes being regulated by a template.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The engines have four wheels ; those for the passengers are 5½ and 4 feet in diameter, and those for the goods are&nbsp;each pair 5 feet in diameter. Each wheel has a cast iron&nbsp;centre ; and the spokes are of wrought iron, accurately fitted&nbsp;into the nave. Thetireconsists of two thicknesses, the inner&nbsp;being 3-4 ths of an inch when finished, of the best Staffordshire&nbsp;iron, well secured to the end of the spokes by riveting, the&nbsp;ends of the spokes having been previously turned in their&nbsp;exact position. The outside tire is made of the very best&nbsp;Bowling or Lowmoor iron Igths inches thick when finished.&nbsp;When the outside of the inner tire has been well riveted&nbsp;to the spokes it is turned ; and the inside of the outer tire&nbsp;having been accurately bored, so as to secure a perfect fit,&nbsp;it is then shrunk on, and the outside turned and finished.&nbsp;The naves are bored out, and the axles turned to fit ; they&nbsp;are secured on by two steel keys, one inch square, at right&nbsp;angles with each other. The goods’ engine wheels are connected on the outside by a rod, with a ball pin at one end,&nbsp;and a parallel pin at the other. These engines have also a&nbsp;damper to their blast pipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The crank axles are made from Backbarrow iron, cut out of solid blocks, and finished according to full-sized drawings.&nbsp;The straight axles are made of the very best scrap iron. The&nbsp;framing of the engine is of wrought iron accurately fitted.&nbsp;There is one pump attached to each cross-head, and made&nbsp;of good tough brass, the suction pieces being connected by&nbsp;Macintosh hose pipes, with screw coupling joints next the&nbsp;engine. The eccentrics are fixed on the crank axles in the&nbsp;mode shewn by drawings. The steam and exhausting pipes&nbsp;are of copper, No. 12 wire guage in thickness. When these&nbsp;engines are made by other persons, templates and full-sized&nbsp;working drawings are given out, from which no deviation&nbsp;whatever is allowed without Mr. Bury’s approbation, so as to&nbsp;secure all parts of the engines matching each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The top of the fire-box has a copper cover, No. 16 wire guage tllick, secured to the wooden covering on the lower</span></p>
