            <p>the characters who ſpeak are Idumaeans, or at leaſt Arabians of the adjacent country,
                all originally of the race of Abraham. The language is pure Hebrew, although the
                author appears to be an Idumaean; for it is not improbable that all the poſterity of
                Abraham, Iſraelites, Idumaeans, and Arabians, whether of the family of Keturah or
                Iſhmael, ſpoke for a conſiderable length of time one common language. That the
                Idumaeans, however, and the Temanites in particular, were eminent for the reputation
                of wiſdom, appears by the teſtimony of the prophets Jeremiah and Obadiah@@⁋: Baruch
                alſo particularly mentions them among “the authors (or expounders) of fables, and
                ſearchers out of underſtanding@@§”</p>
            <p>The principal perſonage in this poem is Job; and in his character is meant to be
                exhibited (as far as is conſiſtent with human infirmity) an example of perfect
                virtue. This is intimated in the argument or introduction, but is ſtill more
                eminently diſplayed by his</p>
            <p>own actions and ſentiments. He is holy, devout, and moſt piouſly and reverently
                impreſſed with the ſacred awe of his divine Creator; he is alſo upright, and
                conſcious of his own integrity; he is patient of evil, and yet very remote from that
                inſenſibility or rather ſtupidity to which the Stoic ſchool pretended. Oppreſſed
                therefore with unparalleled misfortunes, he laments his miſery, and even wiſhes a
                releaſe by death; in other words, he obeys, and gives place to the dictates of
                nature. Irritated, however, by the unjuſt inſinuations and the severe reproaches of
                his pretended friends, he is more vehemently exaſperated, and the too great
                confidence in his own righteouſneſs leads him to expoſtulate with God in terms
                ſcarcely conſiſtent with piety and ſtrict decorum.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the firſt ſpeech of Job, though it burſts forth with all
                the vehemence of paſſion, consists wholly of complaint, “the words and ſentiments of
                a deſpairing perſon, empty as the wind@@*;”</p>
            <p>@@@[m]⁋ Jer. xlix. 7. Ob. 8. </p>
            <p>@@@[m]§ Baruch iii. 22. 23.</p>
            <p>@@@[m]* Job vi. 26.</p>
