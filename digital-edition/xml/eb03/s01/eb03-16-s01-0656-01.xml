the <hi rend="smallcaps">soap-berry tree,</hi> in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the octandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 23d order, <hi rend="italic">Trihilatae.</hi> The calyx is tetraphyllous; the petals four; the capſules are fleſhy, connate, and ventricoſe.</p><p>The ſpecies are four, the ſaponaria, ſpinoſus, trifoliatus, and chinenſis. The ſaponaria, with winged leaves, grows naturally in the iſlands of the Weit Indies, where it riſes with a woody ſtalk from 20 to 30 feet high, fending out many branches garniſhed with winged leaves compoſed of ſeveral pair of ſpear-ſhaped lobes. The midrib has a membranaceous or leafy border, running on each fide from one pair of lobes to the other, which is broadeſt in the middle between the lobes; the flowers are produced in looſe ſpikes at the end of the branches; they are ſmall and white, ſo make no great appearance. Theſe are ſucceeded by oval berries as large as middling cherries, ſometimes</p><p>ſingle, at others, two, three, or four are joined together; theſe have a ſaponaceous ſkin or cover, which incloſes a very ſmooth roundiſh nut of the ſame form, of a ſhining black when ripe. The ſkin or pulp which ſurrounds the nuts is uſed in America to waſh linen; but it is very apt to burn and deſtroy it if often uſed, being of a very acrid nature.</p><p>Theſe plants are propagated by ſeeds; they muſt be put into ſmall pots, and plunged into a hot-bed of tanners bark. In five or ſix weeks the plants will appear, when the glaſſes of the hot-bed ſhould be raiſed every day in warm weather, to admit freſh air to the plants. In three weeks or a month after the plants appear, they will be fit to be tranſplanted, when they muſt be ſhaken out of the pots, and carefully parted, ſo as not to injure their roots, and each planted into a ſeparate ſmall pot, and plunged into the hot-bed again, obſerving to ſhade them from the ſun until they have taken new root; after which time they muſt have free air admitted to them every day when the weather is warm, and will require to be frequently watered.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
