<p><span class="font1">Richelieu, partly because of his medical reputation, but more because of his philanthropy. He received the titles of physician&nbsp;and councillor to the king, and was desired to organize a scheme&nbsp;of public assistance. Many difficulties were put in his way,&nbsp;however, and he therefore returned until 1624 to Poitou, where&nbsp;Richelieu made him ■“ commissary general of the poor.” It&nbsp;was six years before he was able to begin his work in Paris by&nbsp;opening an information bureau at the sign of the Grand Coq&nbsp;near the Pont Saint-Michel. This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bureau Padresse</span><span class="font1"> was labour&nbsp;bureau, intelligence department, exchange and charity organization in one; and the sick were directed to doctors prepared&nbsp;to give them free treatment. Presently he established a free&nbsp;dispensary in the teeth of the opposition of the faculty in Paris.&nbsp;The Paris faculty refused to accept the new medicaments proposed by the heretic from Montpellier, restricting themselves to&nbsp;the old prescriptions of blood-letting and purgation. In addition&nbsp;to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bureau Padresse</span><span class="font1"> Renaud estabhshed a system of lectures&nbsp;and debates on scientific subjects, the reports of which from&nbsp;1633 to 1642 were published in 1651 with the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil des&nbsp;conférences publiques.</span><span class="font1"> Under the protection of Richelieu he&nbsp;started the first French newspaper, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font1"> (1631), which&nbsp;appeared weekly and contained political and foreign news.&nbsp;He also edited the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mercure français</span><span class="font1"> and published all manner&nbsp;■of reports and pamphlets. In 1637 he opened in Paristhe first&nbsp;Mont de Piété, an institution of which he had seen the advantages&nbsp;in Italy. In 1640 the medical faculty, headcd by Guy Patin,&nbsp;started a campaign against the innovator of the Grand Coq.&nbsp;After the death of Richelieu and of Louis XIII. the victory of&nbsp;Renaudot’s enemies was practically certain. The parlement of&nbsp;Paris ordered him to return the letters patent for the establishment of his bureau and his Mont de Piété, and refused to allow&nbsp;him to practise medicine in Paris. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font1"> remained, and&nbsp;in 1646 Renaudot was appointed by Mazarin historiographer&nbsp;to the king. During the first Fronde he had his printing presses&nbsp;at Saint-Germain. He died on the 25th of October 1653. His&nbsp;difficulties had been increased by his Protestant opinions. His&nbsp;sons Isaac (d. 1688) and Eusèbe (d. 1679) were students for ten&nbsp;years before they could obtain their doctorates from the faculty.&nbsp;They carried on their father’s work, and defended the virtues&nbsp;-of antimony, laudanum and quinine against the schools.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RENDEZVOUS, a place of meeting appointed or arranged for-the assembling of troops, ships or persons.

<p><span class="font1">RENDSBURG, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, situated on the Eider and on the Kaiser&nbsp;Wilhelm canal, in a flat and sandy district 20 m. W. of Kiel, on&nbsp;the Altona-Vamdrup railway. Pop. (1905) 15,577· It consists&nbsp;of three parts—the crowded Altstadt, on an island in the Eider;&nbsp;the Neu werk, on the south bank of the river; and the Rronwerk,&nbsp;on the north bank. Rendsburg is the chief place in the basin of&nbsp;the Eider, and when in the possession of Denmark was maintained as a fortress. Its present importance, however, rests on&nbsp;the commercial facilities afforded by its connexion with the&nbsp;North Sea and the Baltic through the Kaiser Wilhelm canal,&nbsp;by which transit trade is carried on in grain, timber, Swedish&nbsp;iron and coals. The principal industries are cotton-weaving,&nbsp;tanning and the manufacture of artificial manures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rendsburg came into existence under the shelter of a castle founded by the Danes about the year 1100 on an island of the&nbsp;Eider, and was an object of dispute between the Danish kings&nbsp;and the counts of Holstein. In 1252 it was adjudged to the&nbsp;latter. The town was surrounded with ramparts in 1539, but&nbsp;the fortifications of the Kronwerk were not constructed till&nbsp;the end of the 17th century. During the Thirty Years’ War&nbsp;Rendsburg was taken both by the Imperialists and the Swedes,&nbsp;but in 1645 it successfully resisted a second siege by the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The war of 1848-50 began with the capture of Rendsburg by the Holsteiners by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coup de main,</span><span class="font1"> and it formed the centre of&nbsp;the German operations. On the departure of the German&nbsp;troops in 1852 the Danes demolished the fortifications on the&nbsp;north side. Immediately after the death of King Frederick VII.&nbsp;(15th of November 1863) the town was occupied by the Saxon&nbsp;troops acting as the executive of the German Confederation, and&nbsp;it was the base of the operations of the Austrians and Prussians&nbsp;against Schleswig in the spring of the following year. On the&nbsp;termination of the Danish war in 1864 Rendsburg was jointly&nbsp;occupied by Austrian and Prussian military until 1866, when&nbsp;it fell to Prussia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RENÉ L (1409-1480), duke of Anjou, of Lorraine and Bar, count of Provence and of Piedmont, king of Naples, Sicily and&nbsp;Jerusalem, was born at Angers on the 16th of January 1409,&nbsp;the second son of Louis II., king of Sicily, duke of Anjou,&nbsp;count of Provence, and of Yolande of Aragon. Louis II. died&nbsp;in 1417, and his sons, together with their brother-in-law, afterwards Charles VII. of France, were brought up under the&nbsp;guardianship of their mother. The elder, Louis III., succeeded&nbsp;to the crown of Sicily and to the duchy of Anjou, René being&nbsp;known as the count of Guise. By his marriage treaty (1419)&nbsp;with Isabel, elder daughter of Charles II., duke of Lorraine, he&nbsp;became heir to the duchy of Bar, which was claimed as the&nbsp;inheritance of his mother Yolande, and, in right of his wife, heir&nbsp;to the duchy of Lorraine. René, then only ten, was*to be brought&nbsp;up in Lorraine under the guardianship of Charles II. and Louis,&nbsp;cardinal of Bar, both of whom were attached to the Burgundian&nbsp;party, but he retained the right to bear the arms of Anjou.&nbsp;He was far from sympathizing with the Burgundians, and,&nbsp;joining the French army at Reims in 1429, was present at the&nbsp;coronation of Charles VII. When Louis of Bar died in 1430&nbsp;Rene came into sole possession of his duchy, and in the next&nbsp;year, on his father-in-law’s death, he succeeded to the duchy&nbsp;of Lorraine. But the inheritance was claimed by the heir-male,&nbsp;Antoine de Vaudémont, who with Burgundian help defeated&nbsp;René at Bulgneville in July 1431. The Duchess Isabel effected&nbsp;a truce with Antoine de Vaudémont, but the duke remained a&nbsp;prisoner of the Burgundians until April 1432, when he recovered&nbsp;his liberty on parole on yielding up as hostages his two sons,&nbsp;Jean and Louis of Anjou. His title as duke of Lorraine was&nbsp;confirmed by his suzerain, the Emperor Sigismund, at Basel&nbsp;in 1434. This proceeding roused the anger of the Burgundian&nbsp;duke, Philip the Good, who required him early in the next year&nbsp;to return to his prison, from which he was released two years&nbsp;later on payment of a heavy ransom. He had succeeded to&nbsp;the kingdom of Naples through the deaths of his brother Louis III.&nbsp;and of Jeanne II. de Duras, queen of Naples, the last heir&nbsp;of the earlier dynasty. Louis had been adopted by her in&nbsp;1431, and she now left her inheritance to René. The marriage&nbsp;of Marie de Bourbon, niece of Philip of Burgundy, with John,&nbsp;duke of Calabria, René’s eldest son, cemented peace between the&nbsp;two princes. After appointing a regency in Bar and Lorraine,&nbsp;he visited his provinces of Anjou and Provence, and in 1438&nbsp;set sail for Naples, which had been held for him by the Duchess&nbsp;Isabel. René’s captivity, and the poverty of the Angevin&nbsp;resources due to his ransom, enabled Alphonso of Aragon, who&nbsp;had been first adopted and then repudiated by Jeanne II.,&nbsp;to make some headway in the kingdom of Naples, especially&nbsp;as he was already in possession of the island of Sicily. In 1441&nbsp;Alphonso laid siege to Naples, which he sacked after a six months’&nbsp;siege. René returned to France in the same year, and though&nbsp;he retained the title of king of Naples his effective rule was never&nbsp;recovered. Later efforts to recover his rights in Italy failed.&nbsp;His mother Yolande, who had governed Anjou in his absence,&nbsp;died in 1442. René took part in the negotiations with the&nbsp;English at Tours in 1444, and peace was consolidated by the&nbsp;marriage of his younger daughter, Margaret, with Henry VI.&nbsp;at Nancy. René now made over the government of Lorraine&nbsp;to John, duke of Calabria, who was, however, only formally&nbsp;installed as duke of Lorraine on the death of Queen Isabel in</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
