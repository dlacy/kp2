Each colony had its own internal constitution, formed generally on the model of that of the mother-city ; hence it naturally became an object of Roman policy to keep the colonies in perfect dependence. This colonial system of the Romans, which necessarily arose out of the custom of depriving the conquered of their lands and liberty, assumed its main features in the Samnite war, and gradually embraced the whole of Italy. But the relations subsisting between Rome and the Italian nations were extremely various in kind.</p><p>A few cities and nations enjoyed the full privileges of Roman citizenship ; in some instances, however, even these were precluded from the right of voting in the comitia. These were the municipal states. The privileges of the colonies were of a more restricted nature : they were indeed in possession of their own civic government, but had no share whatever either in the comitia or the magistracies of Rome. The other inhabitants of Italy were either federates <hi rend="italic">(socii, fœdere juncti),</hi>  or subjects <hi rend="italic">(dedititii).</hi>  The federates preserved their own internal form of government, but were obliged to furnish tribute and auxiliary troops. Their further relation with Rome depended upon the specific terms of their league. The most advantageous of these terms were in favour of the Latins, though each of the Latin cities had its own separate league ; as the rest of the Italian nations had their separate treaty, <hi rend="italic">(jus Ralieum).</hi>  The subjects, on the other band <hi rend="italic">(dedititii),</hi>  were deprived of their internal constitutions, and were governed by Roman magistrates, annually renewed.</p><p>The internal constitution of Rome itself, now completed, bore the aspect of a democracy, inasmuch as equality of rights existed both for nobles and commons. Yet this democracy was modified by expedients so various and intricate ; the rights of the people, the senate, and the magistrates, fitted so accurately into each other, and were so firmly supported by the national religion, connecting every thing with determinate forms, that there seemed to be no immediate reason to fear tlle evils of anarchy, or of military despotism; though the democratic character threatened the one, and the warlike temper of the nation the other, of these dangers. To obtain a right view of the constitution of Rome, thus modified, a few sentences stating the main outline may be given.</p><p>This constitution was not, as must already have been seen, the work of one great master-mind, but was the result of long contentions, innumerable temporary expedients, yielding successively as better were devised, aggressions mutually made by the opposing parties in their hour of strength, and concessions in that of weakness ; aud that steady equipoise obtained by the well-balanced action of opposing principles, knit together into the firmest and closest union by repeated heavings, subsidings, and conjunctions. The rights of the people consisted in the legislative power, so far as fundamental national principles were concerned, and in the election of the magistrates. The distinction between the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa,</hi>  as independent of the senate, and the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi>  as dependent on the senate, still existed as to form, but had lost all its importance, the difference between patricians and plebeians being now merely nominal, and the establishment of the city tribes excluding the too great influence of the mere populace upon the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa.</hi>  The rights of the senate consisted in administering and debating all ordinary national affairs, whether foreign relations, (war and peace only excepted, in which the consent of the people was necessary), financial concerns, or matters regarding domestic peace and security. But the manner in which the senate was supplied and maintained must have made it by far the most skilful political body at tllat time in the world. For a considerable period magisterial power had been the exclusive privilege of the patrician and senatorial order ; but after the plebeians obtained equal access to these offices, the highest rank and power in the state offered a stimulus for exertion to the ambitious career of mental ability from every class and order, thus concentrating the collected mind of the nation, and from it forming a ruling body of unequalled wisdom, genius, and enterprise. The rights and rank of magistrates were founded on their right to the greater or lesser auspices, no public affair being undertaken without the auspices. He only, therefore, who was in possession of the rights of the greater auspices, could hold the highest civil and military power as dictator, consul, or prætor ; such was not the case with those who held only the lesser auspices. The union of the highest civil and military power in the person of the same individual was not without inconvenience and danger; but military despotism was in some measure guarded against by the prohibition of any magistrate from possessing military command within Rome itself. But perhaps the most important of all the principles combined in the constitution of Rome, was the existence and recognised authority of its code of laws. To the sacred voice of public national law could appeal be made at all times, and on every occasion ; and every civic struggle terminated by the addition of some new enactment, which defined the rights and privileges of the contending parties, and left a rule of conduct and a principle of appeal to succeeding ages. This ideal impersonation of law formed, on the one hand, a safeguard against the encroachments of the ruling power, or the deliberative body ; while, on the other, the intemperate fervour of popular will was equally within its controlling influence. Religion and law were the ruling elements of the Roman constitution ; and upon their inherent truth, purity, and power, or the reverse, depended the duration, or the ruin, of Roman virtue and Roman dominion.</p><p>Rome having now obtained the sovereignty of all Italy, was not long in finding employment for her victorious arms in another country. Sicily was the new field on which the strength of Rome was tried, and the Carthaginians were her new antagonists. It appears that a body of Samnite, or Sabellian youth, quitting their homes under the vow of a <hi rend="italic">sewred spring,</hi>@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  had become mercenaries to Agathocles. After his death they seized upon the city Messina, in Sicily, and committed the grossest outrages upon the inhabitants. Having thus made the citizens, and indeed all the inhabitants of Sicily their enemies, these mercenaries (known by the name Mamertines, from the god Mamers, or Mars) sought the protection of the Romans. Some of them had previously applied to the Carthaginians ; and while the Romans were hesitating about lending assistance to such disgraceful allies, the Carthaginians, somewhat less scrupulous, sent a body of troops, and took possession of the citadel of Messina. There had already been such intercourse between Rome and Carthage, as to make each city in some measure aware of the power and ambition of the other. The Roman senate speedily perceived, that if the Carthaginians obtained possession of Sicily, their own prospects of aggrandise-</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  For an account of the<hi rend="italic">ter sacrum,</hi>  see Niebuhr, vol. i. p. 92.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
