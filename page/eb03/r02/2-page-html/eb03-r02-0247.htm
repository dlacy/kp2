The ſum of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> and y is equal&nbsp;to W ; and, on whatever point W is hung, the weights&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> and y are to W in the proportion of Γ)G and DE&nbsp;to GE. Now, in this ſtate of things, it appears&nbsp;that the ſtrain on the ſection CD ariſes immediately&nbsp;from the upward action of the ropes F </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0"> and H </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;the upward preſſions of the blocks E and G ; and that&nbsp;the office of the weight W is to oblige the beam to oppoſe this ſtrain. Things are in the ſame ſtate in reſpect&nbsp;of ſtrain as if a block were ſubſtituted at D for the&nbsp;weight W, and the weights </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> were hung on at&nbsp;E and G ; only the directions will be oppoſite. The&nbsp;beam tends to break in the ſection CD, becauſe the&nbsp;ropes pull it upwards at E and G, while a weight W&nbsp;holds it down at C. It tends to open at D, and C&nbsp;becomes the centre of fracture. The ſtrain therefore is&nbsp;the ſame as if the half ED were fixed in the wall, and&nbsp;a weight equal to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font0"> that is, to the half of W, were&nbsp;hung on at G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we conclude, that a beam ſupported at both ends, but not fixed there, and loaded in the middle,&nbsp;will carry twice as much weight as it can carry at its&nbsp;extremity, when the other extremity is faſt in a wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſtrain occaſioned at any point L by a weight W, hung on at any other point D, is — W ×</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DE _ <sub>τ</sub>, <sub>τ</sub>,<sub>z</sub>, . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>τττ</sub> ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j7q × LG. For EG is to ED as W to the preſſure</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">occaſioned at G. This would be balanced by ſome weight ç acting over the pulley </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h ;</span><span class="font0"> and this tends to&nbsp;break the beam at L, by acting on the lever GL. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">BE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">preſſure at G is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore the ſtrain at L</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font2">is W. </span><span class="font0">jF~√∙ </span><span class="font2">LG.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, the ſtrain occaſioned at the point DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">D by the weight W hung on there, is W X DG ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which is therefore equal to ⅜ W, when D is the middle point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we ſee, that the general ſtrain on the beam ariſing from one weight, is proportionable to the rec-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">, <sub>r</sub> , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>r</sub> ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„ W.DE.DG .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tangle of the parts of the beam, (for---is as</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DE.DG,, and is greateſt when the load is laid on the middle of the beam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We alſo ſee, that the ſti ain at L, by a load at D, is equal to the ſtrain at D by the ſame load at L. And&nbsp;the ſtrain at L, from a load at D, is to the ſtrain&nbsp;by the ſame load at L as DE to LE. Theſe are all&nbsp;very obvious corollaries ; and they ſufficiently inform&nbsp;us concerning the ſtrains which are produced on any&nbsp;part of the timber by a load laid on any other part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we now ſuppoſe the beam to be ſixed at the two ends, that is, firmly framed, or held down by blocks&nbsp;at I and K, placed beyond E and G, or framed into&nbsp;poſts, it will cany twice as much as when its ends were&nbsp;free. For ſuppoſe it ſawn through at CD ; the&nbsp;weight λ⅞ hung on there will be juſt ſufficient to break it at E and G. Now reſtore the connection of the ſec</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><h4><span class="font1">tion CD, it will require another weight </span><span class="font0">W to break it </span><span class="font1">there at the ſame time.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore, when a rafter, or any piece of timber, ia firmly connected with three fixed points G, E, I, it&nbsp;will bear a greater load between any two of them than&nbsp;if its connection with the remote point were removed ;&nbsp;and if it be faſtened in four points, G, E, I, K, it will&nbsp;be twice as ſtrong in the middle part as without the&nbsp;two remote connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One is apt to expect from this that the joiſt of a floor will be nauch ſtrengthened by being firmly built in&nbsp;the wall. It is a little ſtrengthened ; but the hold which&nbsp;can thus be given it is much too ſhort to be of any&nbsp;ſenſible ſervice ; and it tends greatly to ſhatter the wall,&nbsp;becauſe, when it is bent down by a load, it forces up&nbsp;the wail with the momentum of a long lever. Judicious buildeιs therefore take care not to bind the joiſts&nbsp;tight in the wall. But when the joiſt3 of adjoining&nbsp;rooms lie in the ſame direction, it is a great advantage&nbsp;to make them of one piece. They are then twice as&nbsp;ſtrong as when made in two lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is eaſy to deduce from theſe premiſſes the ſtrain on any point which ariſes from the weight of the beam it-felt; or from any load which is uniformly diſſuſed over&nbsp;the whole or any part. We may always conſider thé&nbsp;whole of the weight which is thus uniformly diſſuſed&nbsp;over any part as united in the middle point of that&nbsp;part ; and if the load is not uniformly diſſuſed, we may&nbsp;ſtill ſuppoſe it united at its centre of gravity. Thus,&nbsp;to know the ſtrain at L ariſing from the weight of the&nbsp;whole beam, we may ſuppoſe the whole weight accu- .&nbsp;mulated in its middle point D. Alſo the ſtrain at L<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>ariſing from the weight of the part ED, is the ſame as&nbsp;if this weight were accumulated in the middle point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ci&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of ED ; and it is the ſame as if half the weight of ED&nbsp;were hung on at D. For the real ſtrain at L is the&nbsp;upward preſſure at G, acting by the lever GL. Now&nbsp;call the weight of the part DE </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> ; this upward preſſure</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>ι</sub> e×</span><span class="font0"> √ E ί ſ × DE will be J£G ’ °<sup>r</sup> EG .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore the ſtrain on the middle of a beam, ari≈ fing from its own weight, or from any uniform load, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• , ED</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the weight of the beam or its load × ∣τθ × DG; that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup>s, half the weight of the ſheam or load multiplied or acting by the lever DG ; for ED . <sub>ι</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E G <sup>1S</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alſo the ſtrain at L, ariſing from the weight of the beam, or the unifoim load, is { the weight of the beam&nbsp;or load acting by the lever LG. It is therefore proportional to LG, and is greateſt of all at D. Therefore a beam of uniform ſtrength throughout, uniformly&nbsp;loaded, will bιeak in the middle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is of importance to know the relation between the ſtrains ariſing from the weights of the beams, or&nbsp;from any uniformly diſſuſed load, and the relative&nbsp;ſtrength. We have already ſeen, that the relative</span></p>
