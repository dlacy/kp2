Rákóczy only got 100,000 thalers, the Golden Fleece, and a promise&nbsp;(never kept) that the Hungarians should be included in the&nbsp;general peace. But into a direct alliance with Rákóczy the&nbsp;French king would not enter, and Laszló Vetési, Rákóczy’s&nbsp;envoy at Versailles, in 1708 advised his master to place no&nbsp;further reliance on the French court. Shortly afterwards, at&nbsp;Trencsen (Aug 3, 1708), Rákóczy’s army was scattered to&nbsp;the winds. The rout of Trenesen was followed by a general&nbsp;abandonment. The remnant of the host, too, was now thoroughly demoralized and dared not face the imperialists. A&nbsp;fresh attempt to renew the war in 1710 was speedily ruined by&nbsp;the disaster of Romhány (Jan. 22), and a desperate effort&nbsp;to secure the help of Peter the Great also failing, Rákóczy gave&nbsp;up everything for lost, and on the 21st of February 1711 quitted&nbsp;his country for ever, refusing to accept the general amnesty&nbsp;conceded after the peace of Szatmár (see Hungary, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">He lived for a time in France on the bounty of Louis XIV.,&nbsp;finally entering the Carmelite Order. In 1717, with forty&nbsp;comrades, he volunteered to assist the Turks against the&nbsp;Austrians, but on arriving at Constantinople discovered there&nbsp;was nothing for him to do. He lived for the rest of his life&nbsp;at the little town of Rodostó, where he died on the 8th of April&nbsp;1735. His remains were solemnly transferred to Hungary in&nbsp;1907 at the expense of the state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RALEIGH, SIR WALTER </span><span class="font2">(c. 1552-1618), British explorer, poet and historian, was born probably in 1552, though the date&nbsp;is not quite certain. His father, Walter Raleigh of Fardell, in&nbsp;the parish of Cornwood, near Plymouth, was a country gentleman of old family, but of reduced estate. Walter Raleigh the&nbsp;elder was three times married. His famous son was the child&nbsp;of his third marriage with Catherine, daughter of Sir Philip&nbsp;Champernown of Modbury, and widow of Otho Gilbert of&nbsp;Compton. By her first marriage she had three sons, John,&nbsp;Humphrey and Adrian Gilbert. Mr. Raleigh had been compelled to give up living in his own house of Fardell. His son&nbsp;was born at the farmhouse of Hayes near the head of Budleigh&nbsp;Salterton Bay, on the coast of Devonshire between Exmouth&nbsp;and Sidmouth. The name is written with a diversity excep-tional even in that age. Sir Walter, his father, and a half-brother used different forms. The spelling Raleigh was adopted&nbsp;by Sir Walter’s widow, and has been commonly used, though&nbsp;there has been a tendency to prefer “ Ralegh &quot; in recent times.&nbsp;It was almost certainly pronounced “ Rawley.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1568 he was entered as a commoner of Oriel College, Oxford, but he took no degree, and his residence was brief. In 1569 he&nbsp;followed his cousin Henry Champemown, who took over a body of&nbsp;English volunteers to serve with the French Huguenots. From&nbsp;a reference in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the World</span><span class="font2"> it has been supposed that&nbsp;he was present at the battle of Jarnac (13th of March 1569),&nbsp;and it has been asserted that he was in Paris during the Massacre&nbsp;of St Bartholomew in 1572. Nothing, however, is known with&nbsp;certainty of his life till February 1575,  when he was resident in&nbsp;the Temple. During his trial in 1603 he declared that he had&nbsp;never studied the law, but that his breeding had been “ wholly&nbsp;gentleman, wholly soldier.” In June 1578 his half-brother Sir&nbsp;Humphrey Gilbert obtained a patent for six years authorizing&nbsp;him to take possession of “ any remote barbarous and heathen&nbsp;lands not possessed by any Christian prince or people.&quot; The&nbsp;gentry of Devon had been much engaged in maritime adventure&nbsp;of a privateering or even piratical character since the reign of&nbsp;Henry VIII. In the reign of Elizabeth they were the leaders in&nbsp;colonial enterprises in conflict with the Spaniards in America.&nbsp;During 1578 Humphrey Gilbert led an expedition which was a&nbsp;piratical venture against the Spaniards, and was driven back&nbsp;after an action with them and the loss of a ship in the Atlantic.&nbsp;Raleigh accompanied his half-brother as captain of the “ Falcon,’’&nbsp;and was perhaps with him in an equally unsuccessful voyage of&nbsp;the following year. Gilhert was impoverished by his ventures,&nbsp;and Raleigh had to seek his fortune about the court. In the&nbsp;course of 1580 he was twice arrested for duels, and he attached&nbsp;himself to the queen’s favourite, the earl of Leicester, and to&nbsp;the earl of Oxford, son-in-law of Burghley, for whom he carried&nbsp;a challenge to Sir Philip Sidney. By the end of 1580 he was&nbsp;serving as captain of a company of foot in Munster. He took&nbsp;an active part in suppressing the rebellion of the Desmonds,&nbsp;and in the massacre of the Spanish and Italian adventurers at&nbsp;Smerwick in November. His letters prove that he was the&nbsp;advocate of a ruthless policy against the Irish, and did not&nbsp;hesitate to recommend assassination as a means of getting rid&nbsp;of their leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In December 1581 he was sent home with despatches, as his company had been disbanded on the suppression of the Desmonds.&nbsp;His great fortune dates from his arrival at court where he was&nbsp;already not unknown. Raleigh had been in correspondence with&nbsp;Walsingham for some time. The romantic stories told by Sir&nbsp;Robert Naunton in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fragmenta Regalia,</span><span class="font2"> and by Fuller in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Worthies,</span><span class="font2"> represent at least the mythical truth as to his rise into&nbsp;favour. It is quite possible that Raleigh, at a time when his&nbsp;court clothes represented “ a considerable part of his estate,’’&nbsp;did (as the old story says) throw his mantle on the ground to&nbsp;help the queen to walk dry-shod over a puddle, and that he&nbsp;scribbled verses with a diamond on a pane of glass to attract&nbsp;her attention, though we only have the gossip of a later generation for our authority. It is certain that his tall and handsome&nbsp;person, his caressing manners and his quick wit pleased the&nbsp;queen. The rewards showered on him were out of all proportion&nbsp;to his services in Ireland, which had not been more distinguished&nbsp;than those of many others. In March 1582 he was granted a&nbsp;reward of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">£100,</span><span class="font2"> and the command of a company, nominally&nbsp;that he might be exercised in the wars, but in reality as a form&nbsp;of pension, since he was allowed to discharge his office by deputy&nbsp;and remained at court. In February 1583 he was included in the&nbsp;escort sent to accompany the duke of Anjou from England to&nbsp;Flanders. In 1583 the queen made him a grant of Durham&nbsp;House in the Strand (London), the property of the see of Durham,&nbsp;which had however been used of late as a royal guest-house.&nbsp;In the same year the queen’s influence secured him two beneficial&nbsp;leases from All Souls, Oxford, which he sold to his advantage,&nbsp;and a patent to grant licences to “ vintners,’’—that is, tavern&nbsp;keepers. This he subleased, and when his agent, one Browne,&nbsp;cheated him, he got the grant revoked, and reissued on terms&nbsp;which allowed him to make £2000 a year. In 1584 he had a&nbsp;licence for exporting woollen cloths, a lucrative monopoly which&nbsp;made him very unpopular with the merchants. He was knighted&nbsp;in 1584. In 1585 he succeeded the earl of Bedford as Warden&nbsp;of the Stannaries. Raleigh made a good use of the great powers&nbsp;which the wardenship gave him in the mining districts of the&nbsp;west. He reduced the old customs to order, and showed himself fair to the workers. In 1586 he received a grant of 40,000&nbsp;acres of the forfeited lands of the Desmonds, on the Blackwater&nbsp;in Ireland. He was to plant English settlers, which he endeavoured to do, and he introduced the cultivation of the potato&nbsp;and of tobacco. In 1587 he received a grant in England of&nbsp;part of the forfeited land of the conspirator Babington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During these years Raleigh was at the height of his favour. It was the policy of Queen Elizabeth to have several favourites&nbsp;at once, lest any one might be supposed to have exclusive&nbsp;influence with her. Raleigh was predominant during the&nbsp;period between the predominance of Leicester and the rise of&nbsp;the earl of Essex, who came to court in 1587. It is to be noted&nbsp;that Elizabeth treated Raleigh exclusively as a court favourite,&nbsp;to be enriched by monopolies and grants at the expense of her&nbsp;subjects, but that she never gave him any great office, nor did&nbsp;she admit him to the council. Even his post of captain of the&nbsp;Guard, given in 1587, though honourable, and, to a man who&nbsp;would take gifts for the use of his influence, lucrative, was&nbsp;mainly ornamental. His many offices and estates did not&nbsp;monopolize the activity of Raleigh. The patent given to his&nbsp;half-brother Sir Humphrey Gilbert was to run out in 1584. To</span></p>
