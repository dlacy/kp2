(Richard), one of the moſt remarkable characters that is to be met with perhaps in all the records of biography, was the ion of Anne counteſs of Macclesſied by the earl of Rivers, according to her own confeſſion; and was born in 1698. This confeſſion of adultery was made in order to procure a ſeparation from her huſhand the earl of Macclesfield: yet, having obtained this defired end, no ſooner was her ſpurious offspring brought into the world, than, without the dread of ſhame or poverty to excuſe her, ſhe diſcovered the reſolution of diſowning him; and, as long as he lived, treated him with the moſt unnatural cruelty. She delivered him over to a poor woman to educate as her own; prevented the earl of Rivers from leaving him a legacy of L. 6000, by declaring him dead; and in effect; deprived him of another legacy which his godmother Mrs Lloyd had left him, by concealing from him his birth, and thereby rendering it impoſſible for him to proſecute his claim. She endeavoured to ſend him ſecretly to the plantations; but this plan being either laid aſide or fruſtrated, ſhe placed him apprentice with a ſhoemaker. In this ſituation, however, he did not long continue: for his nurſe dying, he went to take care of the effects of his fiippoſcd mother; and found in<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0672.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0666"/>
her boxes ſome letters which diſcovered to young Savage his birth, and the cauſe of its concealment.</p><p>From the moment of this diſcovery it was natural for him to become diſſatisfied with his ſituation as a ſhoe- maker. He now conceived that he had a right to ſhare in the affluence of his real mother; and therefore he directly, and perhaps indiſcreetly, applied to her, and made uſe of every art to awaken her tenderneſs and attract her regard. But in vain did he ſolicit this unnatural parent; ſhe avoided him with the utmoſt precaution, and took meaſures to prevent his ever entering her houſe on any pretence whatever.</p><p>Savage was at this time ſo touched with the diſcovery of his birth, that he frequently made it his practice to walk before his mother’s door in hopes of feeing her by accident; and often did he warmly ſolicit her to admit him to fee her; but all to no purpoſe: he could neither ſoften her heart nor open her hand.</p><p>Mean time, while he was aſſiduouſly endeavouring to rouſe the affections of a mother in whom all natural affection was extinct, he was deſtſtute of the means of ſupport, and reduced to the miſeries of want. We are not told by what means he got rid of his obligation to the ſhoemaker, or whether he ever was actually bound to him; but we now find him very differently employed in order to procure a ſubſiſtence. In ſhort, the youth had parts, and a ſtrong inclination towards literary purſuits, eſpecially poetry. He wrote a poem; and afterwards two plays, <hi rend="italic">Woman's α Riddle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Love in a Veil:</hi> but the author was allowed no part of the profits from the firſt; and from the ſecond he received no other advantage than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steel and Mr Wilks, by whom he was pitied, careffed, and relieved. However, the kindneſs of his friends not affording him a conſtant ſupply, he wrote the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas Overbury;</hi> which not only procured, him the eſteem of many perſons of wit, but brought him in 200l. The celebrated Aaron Hill, Eſq; was of great ſervice to him in correcting and fitting this piece for the ſtage and the preſs; and extended his patronage Rill farther. But Savage was, like many other wits, a bad manager, and was ever in diſtreſs. As faff as his friends raiſed him out of onc difficulty, he ſunk into another; and, when he found himſelf greatly involved, he would ramble about like a vagabond, with fearce a ſhirt on his back. He was in one of theſe ſituations all the time wherein he wrote his tragedy above-mentioned; without a lodging, and often without a dinner: ſo that he uſed to (cribble on ſcraps of paper picked up by accident, or begged in the ſhops, which he occaſionally ſtepped into, as thoughts occurred to him, craving the favour of pen and ink, as it were juſt to take a memorandum.</p><p>Mr Hill alſo earneſtly promoted a ſubſcription to a volume of <hi rend="italic">Miſcellanies,</hi> by Savage; and likewiſe furniſhed part of the poems of which the volume was compoſed. To this miſcellany Savage wrote a preface, in which he gives an account of his mother’s cruelty, in a very uncommon ſtrain of humour.</p><p>The profits of his Tragedy and his Miſcellanies together, had now, for a time, ſomewhat raiſed poor Savage both in circumſtances and credit; ſo that the world juſt began to behold him with a more favourable eye than formerly, when both his fame and life were endangered by a moil unhappy event. A drunken frolic in which he one night engaged, ended in a fray, and Savage unfortunately killed a man, for which he was condemned to be hanged; his friends earneſtly ſolicited the mercy of the crown, while his mother as earneſtly exerted herſelf to prevent his receiving it. The counteſs of Hertford at length laid his whole cafe before queen Caroline, and Savage obtaineda pardon.</p><p>Savage had now loſt that tenderneſs for his mother, which the whole ſeries of her cruelty had not been able wholly to repreſs; and eonſidering her as an implacable enemy, whom nothing but his blood could ſatisfy, threatened to haraſs her with lampoons, and to publiſh a copious narrative of her conduct, unleſs ſhe conſented to allow him a penſion. This expedient proved ſucceſsful; and the lord Tyrconnel, upon his promiſe of laying aſide his deſign of expoſing his mother’s cruelty, took him into his family, treated him as an equal, and engaged to allow him a penſion of 2001 a-year. This was the golden part of Savage’s life. He was courted by all who endeavoured to be thought men of genius, and careſſed by all who valued themſelves upon a refined taſte. In this gay period of his life he publiſhed the <hi rend="italic">Temple oſ Health and Mirth,</hi> on the recovery of lady Tyrconnel from a languiſhing illneſs; and <hi rend="italic">The Wanderer,</hi> a moral poem, which he dedicated to lord Tyrconnel, in ſtrains of the higheſt panegyric: but theſe praiſes he in a ſhort time found himſelf inclined to retract, being diſcarded by the man on whom they were beſtowed. Of this quarrel lord Tyrconnel and Mr Savage aſſigned very different reaſons. Our author’s known character pleads too ſtrongly againſt him; for his conduct was ever ſuch as made all his friends, ſooner or later, grow weary of him, and even forced moſt of them to become his enemies.</p><p>Being thus once more turned adrift upon the world, Savage, whoſe paſſions were very ſtrong, and whoſe gratitude was very ſmall, became extremely diligent in expoſing the faults of lord Tyrconnel. He, moreover, now thought himſelf at liberty to take revenge upon his mother. —Accordingly he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Baftard,</hi> a poem, remarkable for the vivacity of its beginning (where he finely enumerates the imaginary advantages of baſe birth), and for the pathetic concluſion, wherein he recounts the real calamities which he ſuffered by the crime of his parents. —The reader will not be diſpleafſd with a tranſcript of ſome of the lines in the opening of the poem, as a ſpecimen of this writer’s ſpirit and manner of verſification.</p><p>Bleſt be the baſtard’s birth! thro’ wondrous ways,</p><p>He ſhines eccentric like a comet’s blaze.</p><p>No ſickly fruit of faint compliance he;</p><p>He! ſtamp’d in nature’s mint with ecſtaſy!</p><p>He lives to build, not boaſt, a gen’rous race;</p><p>No tenth tranſmitter of a fooliſh face.</p><p>He, kindling from within, requires no flame,</p><p>He glories in a baſtard’s glowing name.</p><p>—Nature’s unbounded ſon, he ſtands alone,</p><p>His heart unbias’d, and his mind his own.</p><p>—O mother! yet no mother! — tis to you</p><p>My thanks for ſuch diſtinguiſh’d claims are due.</p><p>This poem had an extraordinary ſale; and its appearance happening at the time when his mother was at Bath, many perſons there took frequent opportunities of repeating paſſages from the Baſtard in her hear<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0673.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0667"/>
ing. This was perhaps the firſt time that ever ſhe diſcovered a ſenſe of ſhame, and on this occaſion the power of wit was very conſpicuous: the wretch who had, without ſcruple, proclaimed herſelf an adultereſs, and who had firſt endeavoured to ſtarve her ſon, then to tranſport him, and afterwards to hang him, was not able to bear the repreſentation of her own conduct; but fled from reproach, though ſhe felt no pain from guilt; and left Bath with the utmoſt haſte, to ſhelter herſelf among the crowds of London<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Mr Boſwell, in his life of Dr Johnſon, has called in queſtion the ſtory of Savage’s birth, and grounded his ſuſpicion on two miſtakes, or, as he calls them, falſehoods, which he thinks he has diſcovered in his friend’s memoirs of that extraordinary man. Johnſon has ſaid, that the earl of Rivers was Savage’s godfather, and gave him his own name; which, by his direction, was inſerted in the regiſter of the pariſh of St Andrew’s, Holborn. Part of this, it ſeems, is not true; for Mr Boſwell carefully inſpected that regiſter, but no ſuch entry is to be found. But does this omiſſion amount to a proof, that the perſon who called himſelf <hi rend="italic">Richard Savage</hi> was an impoſtor, and not the ſon of the earl of Rivers and the counteſs of Macclesfield? Mr Boſwell thinks it does; and, in behalf of his opinion, appeals to the maxim <hi rend="italic">falſum in uno, falſum in omnibus.</hi> The ſolidity of this maxim may be allowed by others; but it was not without ſurpriſe that, on ſuch an occaſion, we found it adopted by the biographer of Johnſon. To all who have compared his view of a celebrated cauſe, with Stuart’s letters on the ſame ſubject addreſſed to Lord Mansfield, it muſt be apparent, that, at one period of his life, he would not have deemed a thouſand ſuch miſtakes ſufficient to invalidate a narrative otherwiſe ſo well authenticated as that which relates the birth of Savage. The truth is, that the omiſſion of the name in the regiſter of St Andrew’s may be eaſily accounted for, without bringing againſt the wretched Savage an accuſation of impoſture, which neither his mother nor her friends dared to urge when provoked to it by every poſſible motive that can influence human conduct. The earl of Rivers would undoubtedly give the direction about regiſtering the child’s name to the ſame perſon whom he entruſted with the care of his education; but that perſon, it is well known, was the counteſs of Macclesfield, who, as ſhe had reſolved from his birth to diſown her ſon, would take care that the direction ſhould not be obeyed.</p><p>That which, in Johnſon’s life of Savage, Mr Boſwell calls a ſecond falſehood, ſeems not to amount even to a miſtake. It is there ſtated, that “Lady Macclesfield having lived for ſome time upon very uneaſy terms with her huſhand, thought a public confeſſion of adultery the moſt obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty. ” This Mr Boſwell thinks cannot be true; becauſe, having peruſed the journals of both houſes of parliament at the period of her divorce, he there found it authentically aſcertained, that ſo far from voluntarily ſubmitting to the ignominious charge of adultery, ſhe made a ſtrenuous defence by her counſel. But what is this to the purpoſe? Johnſon has nowhere ſaid, that ſhe confeſſed her adultery at <pb n="668"/> the bar of either houſe of parliament, but only that her confeſſion was <hi rend="italic">public;</hi> and as he has taught us in his Dictionary, that whatever is <hi rend="italic">notorious</hi> or <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> known is <hi rend="italic">public;</hi> public, in his ſenſe of the word, that confeſſion certainly was, if made to different individuals, in ſuch a manner as ſhowed that ſhe was not anxious to conceal it from her huſband, or to prevent its notoriety. She might, however, have very cogent reaſons for denying her guilt before parliament, and for making a ſtrenuous defence by her counſel; as indeed, had ſhe acted otherwiſe, it is very little probable that her great fortune would have been reſtored to her, or that ſhe could have obtained a ſecond huſband.</p><p>But Mr Boſwell is of opinion, that the perſon who aſſumed the name of Richard Savage was the ſon of the ſhoemaker under whoſe care Lady Macclesfield’s child was placed; becauſe “his not being able to obtain payment of Mrs Lloyd’s legacy mull be imputed to his conſciouſneſs that he was not the real perſon to whom that legacy was left.” He muſt have a willing mind who can admit this argument as a proof of impoſture. Mrs Lloyd died when Savage was in his 10th year, when he certainly did not know or ſuſpect that he was the perſon for whom the legacy was intended, when he had none to proſecute his claim, to ſhelter him from oppreſſion, or to call in law to the aſſiſtance of juſtice. In ſuch circumſtances he could not have obtained payment of the money, unleſs the executors of the will had been inſpired from heaven with the knowledge of the perſon to whom it was due.</p><p>To theſe and a thouſand ſuch idle cavils it is a ſufficient anſwer, that Savage was acknowledged and patronized as Lady Macclesfield’s ſon by Lord Tyrconnel, who was that lady’s nephew; by Sir Richard Steel the intimate friend of colonel Brett, who was that lady’s ſecond huſband; by the Queen, who, upon the authority of that lady and her creatures, once thought Savage capable of entering his <hi rend="italic">mother’s</hi> houſe in the night with an intent to murder her; and in effect by <hi rend="italic">the lady herſelſ,</hi> who at one time was prevailed upon to give him 501. and who fled before the Satire of the <hi rend="italic">Baſtard,</hi> without offering, either by herſelf or her friends, to deny that the author of that poem was the perſon whom he called himſelf, or to inſinuate ſo much as that he might <hi rend="italic">poſſibly</hi> be the ſon of a ſhoemaker. To Mr Boſwell all this ſeems <hi rend="italic">ſtrange:</hi> to others, who look not with ſo keen an eye for ſuppoſititious births, we think it muſt appear <hi rend="italic">convincing.</hi></p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>Some time after this, Savage formed the reſolution of applying to the queen; who having once given him life, he hoped ſhe might farther extend her goodneſs to him by enabling him to ſupport it. —With this view, he publiſhed a poem on her birthday, which he entitled <hi rend="italic">The Volunteer-Laureat;</hi> for which ſhe was pleaſed to ſend him 501. with an intimation that he might annually expect the ſame bounty. But this annual allowance was nothing to a man of his ſtrange and Angular extravagance. His uſual cuſtom was, as ſoon as he had received his penſion, to diſappear with it, and ſecrete himſelf from his most intimate friends, till every ſhilling of the 501. was ſpent; which done, he again appeared, pennyleſs as before: But he would never inform any perſon where he had been, nor in what manner his money had been diſſipated. —From the reports, however, of ſome who found means to penetrate his haunts, it would ſeem that he expended both his time and his caſh in the moſt fordid and deſpicable ſenſuality; particularly in eating and drinking, in which he would indulge in the moſt unſocial manner, fitting whole days and nights by himſelf, in obſcure houſes of entertainment, over his bottle and trencher, immerſed in filth and ſloth, with ſcarce decent apparel; generally wrapped up in a horſeman’s great coat; and, on the whole, with his very homely countenance, and altogether, exhibiting an object the moſt diſguſting to the fight, if not to ſome</p><p>other of the ſenſes.</p><p>His wit and parts, however, ſtill raiſed him new friends as faſt as his miſhehaviour loſt him his old ones. Yet ſuch was his conduct, that occaſional relief only furniſhed the means of occaſional exceſs; and he defeated all attempts made by his friends to fix him in a decent way. He was even reduced ſo low as to be deſtitute of a lodging; inſomuch that he often paſſed his nights in thoſe mean houſes that are ſet open for caſual wanderers; ſometimes in cellars amidſt the riot and filth of the moſt profligate of the rabble; and not ſeldom would he walk the ſtreets till he was weary, and then lie down in ſummer on a bulk, or in winter with his aſſociates among the aſhes of a glaſs-houſe.</p><p>Yet, amidſt all his penury and wretchedneſs, had this man ſo much pride, and ſo high an opinion of his own merit, that he ever kept up his ſpirits, and was always ready to repreſs, with ſcorn and contempt, the leaſt appearance of any flight or indignity towards himſelf, in the behaviour of his acquaintance; among whom he looked upon none as his ſuperior. He would be treated as an equal, even by perſons of the higheſt rank. We have an inſtance of this prepoſterous and inconſiſtent pride, in his refuſing to wait upon a gentleman who was deſirous of relieving him when at the loweſt ebb of diſtreſs, only becauſe the meſſage ſignified the gentleman’s deſire to ſee him at nine in the morning. Savage could not bear that any one ſhould preſume to preſcribe the hour of his attendance, and therefore he abſolutely rejected the proffered kindneſs. This life, unhappy as it may be already imagined, was yet rendered more unhappy, by the death of the queen, in 1738; which ſtroke deprived him of all hopes from the court. His penſion was diſcontinued, and the inſolent manner in which he demanded of Sir Robert<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0674.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0668"/>
Walpole to have it reſtored, for ever cut off this confiderable ſupply; which poſſibly had been only delayed, and might have been recovered by proper application.</p><p>His diſtreſs now became ſo great, and ſo notorious, that a ſcheme was at length concerted for procuring him a permanent relief. It was propoſed that he ſhould retire into Wales, with an allowance of 501. <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> on which he was to live privately, in a cheap place, for ever quitting his town-haunts, and reſigning all farther pretenſions to fame. This offer he ſeemed gladly to accept; but his intentions were only to deceive his friends, by retiring for a while, to write another tragedy, and then to return with it to London in order to bring it upon the ſtage.</p><p>In 1739, he ſet out for Swanſey, in the Briſtol ſtage- coach, and was furniſhed with 15 guineas to bear the expence of his journey. But, on the 14th day after his departure, his friends and benefactors, the principal of whom was no other than the great Mr Pope, who expected to hear of his arrival in Wales, were ſurpriſed with a letter from Savage, inſormingthem that he was yet upon the road, and could not proceed for want of money. There was no other remedy than a remittance; which was ſent him, and by the help of which he was enabled to reach Briſtol, from whence he was to proceed to Swanſey by water. At Briſtol, however, he found an embargo laid upon the ſhipping; ſo that he could not immediately obtain a paſſage. Here, therefore, being obliged to ſtay for ſome time, he, with his uſual facility, ſo ingratiateel himſelf with the principal inhabitants, that he was frequently invited to their houſes, diſtinguiſhed at their public entertainments, and treated with a regard that highly gratified his vanity, and therefore eaſily engaged his affections. At length, with great reluctance, he proceeded to Swanſey; where he lived about a year, very much diſſatisfied with the</p><p>diminution of his ſalary; for he had, in his letters, treated his contributors ſo inſolently, that moſt of them withdrew their ſubſcriptions. Here be finiſhed his tragedy, and reſolved to return with it to London: which was ſtrenuouſly oppoled by his great and confiant friend Mr Pope; who propoſed that Savage ſhould put this play into the hands of Mr Thomſon and Mr Mallet, in order that they might ſit it for the ſtage, that his friends ſhould receive the profits it might bring in, and that the author ſhould receive the produce by way of annuity. This kind and prudent ſcheme was rejected by Savage with the utmoſt contempt. He declared he would not ſubmit his works to any one’s correction; and that he would no longer be kept in leading-ſtrings. Accordingly he ſoon returned to Briſtol, in his way to London; but at Briſtol, meeting with a repetition of the lame kind treatment he had before found there, he was tempted to make a ſecond ſtay in that opulent city for ſome time. Here he was again not only careſſed and treated, but the ſum of 30l. was raiſed for him, with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for London: But he never conſidered that a frequent repetition of ſuch kindneſs was not to be expected, and that it was poſſible to tire out the generoſity of his Briſtol friends, as he had before tired his friends everywhere elſe. In ſhort, he remained here till his company was no longer welcome. His viſits in every family were too often repeated; his wit had lolt its novelty, and his irregular behaviour grew troubleſome. Neceſſity came upon him before he was aware; his money was ſpent, his clothes were worn out, his appearance was ſhabby, and his preſence was diſgultſul at every table. He now began to find every man from home at whoſe houſe he called; and he found it difficult to obtain a dinner. Thus reduced, it would have been prudent in him to have withdrawn from the place; but prudence and Savage were never<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0675.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0669"/>
acquainted. He ſtaid, in the midſt of poverty, hunger, and contempt, till the miſtreſs of a coffee-houſe, to whom he owed about eight pounds, arreſted him for the debt. He remained for ſome time, at a great expence, in the houſe of the ſheriff’s officer, in hopes of procuring bail; which expence he was enabled to defray, by a preſent of five guineas from Mr Naſh at Bath. No bail, however, was to be found; ſo that poor Savage was at laſt lodged in Newgate, a priſon ſo named in Briſtol.</p><p>But it was the fortune of this extraordinary mortal always to find more friends than he deſerved. The keeper of the priſon took compaſſion on him, and greatly ſoftened the rigours of his confinement by every kind of indulgence; be ſupported him at his own table, gave him a commodious room to himſelf, allowed him to ſtand at the door of the gaol, and even frequently took him into the fields for the benefit of the air and exerciſe: ſo that, in reality, Savage endured fewer hardſhips in this place than he had uſually ſuffered during the greateſt part of his life.</p><p>While he remained in this not intolerable priſon, his ingratitude again broke out, in a bitter ſatire on the city of Briſtol; to which he certainly owed great obligations, notwithſtanding the circumſtances of his arreſt; which was but the act of an individual, and that attended with no circumſtances of injuſtice or cruelty. This ſatire he entitled <hi rend="italic">London and Briſtοl delineated;</hi> and in it he abuſed the inhabitants of the latter, with ſuch a ſpirit of reſentment, that the reader would imagine he had never received any other than the moſt injurious treatment in that city.</p><p>When Savage had remained about ſix months in this hoſpitable priſon, he received a letter from Mr Pope, (who ſtill continued to allow him 20 h a-year) containing a charge of very atrocious ingratitude. What were the particulars of this charge we are not informed; but, from the notorious character of the man, there is reaſon to fear that Savage was but too juſtly accuſed. He, however, ſolemnly proteſted his innocence; but he was very unuſually affected on this occaſion. In a few days after, he was ſeized with a diſorder, which at firſt was not ſuſpected to be dangerous: but growing daily more languid and dejected, at laſt a fever ſeized him; and he expired on the 1ſt of Auguſt 1743, in the 46th year of his age.</p><p>Thus lived, and thus died, Richard Savage, Eſq; Leaving behind him a character ſtrangely chequered with vices and good qualities. Of the former we have ſeen a variety of inſtarrces in this abſtract of his life; of the latter, his peculiar ſituation in the world gave him but few opportunities of making any conſiderable diſplay. He was, however, undoubtedly a man of excellent parts; and had he received the full benefits of a liberal education, and had his natural talents been cultivated to the beſt advantage, he might have made a reſpectable figure in life. He was happy in a quick diſcernment, a retentive memory, and a lively flow of wit, which made his company much coveted; nor was his judgment both of writings and of men inferior to his wit: but he was too much a ſlave to his paſſions, and his paſſions were too eaſily excited. He was warm in his friendſhips, but implacable in his enmity; and his greateſt fault, which is indeed the greateſt of all faults, was ingratitude. Hc ſeemed to think every thing due to his merit, and that he was little obliged to any one for thoſe favours which he thought it their duty to confer on him: it is therefore the leſs to be wondered at, that he never rightly eſtimated the kindneſs of his many friends and benefactors, or preſerved a grateful and due ſenſe of their generoſity towards him.</p><p>The works of this orginal writer, after having long lain diſperſed in magazines and fugitive publications, have been lately collected and publiſhed in an elegant edition, in 2 vols 8vo; to which are prefixed, the admirable Memoirs of Savage, written by Dr Samuel Johnſon.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Savage</hi> is a word ſo well underſtood as ſcarcely to require explanation. When applied to inferior animals, it denotes that they are wild, untamed, and cruel; when applied to man, it is of much the ſame import with <hi rend="italic">barbarian,</hi> and means a perſon who is untaught and uncivilized, or who is in the rude ſtate of uncultivated nature. That ſuch men exiſt at preſent, and have exiſted in moſt ages of the world, is undeniable; but a queſtion naturally occurs reſpecting the origin of this ſavage ſtate, the determination of which is of conſiderable importance in developing the nature of man, and aſcertaining the qualities and powers of the human mind. Upon this ſubject, as upon moſt others, opinions are very various, and the ſyſtems built upon them are conſequcntly very contradictory. A large ſect of ancient philoſophers maintained that man ſprung at firſt from the earth like his brother vegetables; that he was without ideas and without ſpeech; and that many ages elapſed before the race acquired the uſe of language, or attained to greater knowledge than the beaſts of the foreſt. Other ſects again, with the vulgar, and almoſt all the poets, maintained that the ſirſt mortals were wiſer and happier, and more powerful, than any of their offspring; that mankind, inſtead of being originally ſavages, and riſing to the ſtate of civilization by their own gradual and progreſſive exertions, were created in a high degree of perfection; that, however, they degenerated from that ſtate, and that all nature degenerated with them. Hence the various ages of the world have almoſt everywhere been compared to gold, ſilver, braſs, and iron, the golden having been always ſuppoſed to be the firſt age.</p><p>Since the revival oſ letters in Europe, and eſpecially during the preſent century, the ſame queſtion has been much agitated both in France and England, and by far the greater part of the moſt faſhionable names in modern ſcience have declared for the original ſavagiſm of men. Such of the ancients as held that opinion were countenanced by thc atheiſtic coſmogony of the Phenicians, and by the early hiſtory of their own nations; the moderns build their ſyſtem upon what they ſuppoſe to be the conſtitution of the human mind, and upon the late improvements in arts and ſciences. As the queſtion muſt finally be decided by hiſtorical evidence, before we make our appeal to facts, we ſhall conſider the force of the modern reaſonings from the ſuppoſed innate powers of the human mind; for that reaſoning is totally different from the other, and to blend them together would only prevent the reader from having an adequate conception of either.</p><p>Upon the ſuppoſition that all mankind were originally ſavages, deſtitute of the uſe of ſpeech, and, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the words, <hi rend="italic">mutum et turpe pecus,</hi> the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0676.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0670"/>
great difficulty is to conceive how they could emerge from that ſtate, and become at laſt enlightened and civilized. The modern advocates for the universality of the ſavage ſtate remove this difficulty by a number of inſtincts or internal ſenſes, with which they ſuppoſe the human mind endowed, and by which the ſavage is, without reflection, not only enabled to dillinguiſh between right and wrong, and prompted to do every thing neceſſary to the preſervation of his exiſtence, and the continuance of the ſpecies, but alſo led to the diſcovery of what will contribute, in the firſt inſtance, to the eaſe and accommodations of life. Theſe inſtincts, they think, brought mankind together when the reaſoning faculty, which had hitherto been dormant, being now rouſed by the colliſions of ſociety, made its obſervations upon the conſequences of their different actions, taught them to avoid ſuch as experience ſhowed to be pernicious, and to improve upon thoſe which they Found beneficial; and thus was the progreſs of civilization begun. But this theory is oppoſed by objections which we know not how to obviate. The bundle of inſtincts with which modern idleneſs, under the denomination of philoſophy, has ſo amply ſurniſhed the human mind, is a mere chimera. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Instinct. )</hi> But granting its reality, it is by no means ſufficient to produce the conſequences which are derived from it. That it is not the parent of language, we have ſhown at large in another place (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Language,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 1—7. ); and we have the confeſſion of ſome of the ableſt advocates for the original ſavagiſm of man, that large ſocieties muſt have been formed before language could have been invented. How ſocieties, at leaſt large ſocieties, could be formed and kept together without language, we have not indeed been told; but we are aſſured by every hiſtorian and every traveller of credit, that in ſuch ſocieties only have mankind been found civilized. Among known ſavages the ſocial ſtorge is very much confined; and therefore, had it been in the firſt race of men of as enlarged a nature, and as ſafe a guide, as the inſtinctive philoſophers contend that it was, it is plain that thoſe men could not have been ſavages. Such an appetite for ſociety, and ſuch a director of conduct, inſtead of enabling mankind to have emerged from ſavagiſm, would have effectually prevented them from ever becoming ſavage; it would have knit them together from the very firſt, and furniſhed opportunities for the progenitors of the human race to have begun the proceſs of civilization from the moment that they dropt from the hands of their Creator. Indeed, were the modern theories of internal ſenſes and ſocial affections well founded, and were theſe ſenſes and affections ſufficient to have impelled the firſt men into ſociety, it is not eaſy to be conceived how there could be at this day a ſavage tribe on the face of the earth. Natural cauſes, operating in the ſame direction and with the ſame force, muſt in every age produce the ſame effects; and if the ſocial affections of the firſt mortals impelled them to ſociety, and their reaſoning faculties immediately commenced the proceſs of civilization, ſurely the ſame affections and the ſame faculties would in a greater or leſs degree have had the ſame effect in every age and on every tribe of their numerous offspring; and we ſhould everywhere obſerve mankind advancing in civilization, inſtead of ſtanding ſtill as they often do, and ſometimes retreating by a retrograde motion. This, however, is far from being the caſe. Hordes of ſavages exiſt in almoſt every quarter of the globe; and the Chineſe, who have undoubtedly been in a ſtate of civilization for at leaſt 2000 years, have during the whole of that long period been abſolutely ſtationary, if they have not loſt ſome of their ancient arts. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Porcelain).</hi> The origin of civilization, therefore, is not to be looked for in human inſtincts or human propenſities, carrying men forward by a natural progreſs; for the ſuppoſition of ſuch propenſities is contrary to fact; and by fact and hiſtorical evidence, in conjunction with what we know of the nature of man, muſt this great queſtion be at laſt decided.</p><p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Religion,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 7. it has been ſhewn that the firſt men, if left to themſelves without any inſtruction, inſtead of living the life of ſavages, and in proceſs of time advancing towards civilization, muſt have periſhed before they acquired even the uſe of ſome of their ſenſes. In the ſame article it has been ſhown (n⁰ 14—17. ), that Moſes, as he is undoubtedly the old- eſt hiſtorian extant, wrote likewiſe by immediate inſpiration; and that therefore, as he repreſents our firſt parents and their immediate deſcendants as in a ſtate far removed from that of ſavages, it is vain to attempt to deduce the originality of ſuch a ſtate from hypothetical theories of human nature. We have, indeed, heard it obſerved by ſome of the advocates for the antiquity and univerſality of the ſavage ſtate, that to the appeal to revelation they have no objection, provided we take the Moſaic account as it ſtands, and draw not from it conclulions which it will not ſupport.</p><p>They contend, at the ſame time, that there is no argument fairly deducible from the book of Geneſis which militates againſt their poſition. Now we beg leave to remark, that beſides the reaſoning which we have already uſed in the article juſt referred to, we have as much poſitive evidence againſt their poſition as the nature of the Moſaic hiſtory could be ſuppoſed to afford.</p><p>We are there told that God created man after his own image; that he gave him dominion over every thing in the ſea, in the air, and over all the earth; that he appointed for his food various kinds of vegetables; that he ordained the Sabbath to be obſerved by him, in commemoration of the works of creation; that he prepared for him a garden to till and to dreſ; and that, as a teſt of his religion and ſubmiſſion to his Creator, he forbade him, under ſevere penalties, to eat of a certain tree in that garden. We are then told that God brought to him every animal which had been created; and we find that Adam was ſo well acquainted with their ſeveral natures as to give them names. When too an helpmate was provided for him, he immediately acknowledged her as bone of his bone, fleſh of his fleſh, and called her <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> becauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</p><p>How theſe facts can be reconciled to a ſtate of ignorant ſavagiſm is to us abſolutely inconceivable; and it is indeed ſtrange, that men who profeſs Chriſtianity ſhould appeal to reaſon, and ſtick by its deciſion on a queſtion which revelation has thus plainly decided againſt them. But it is agreeable to their theory to believe that man roſe by flow ſteps to the full uſe of his reaſoning powers. To us, on the other hand, it appears equally plauſible to ſuppoſe that our firſt parents were created, not in full maturity, but mere infants, and that they went through the tedious proceſs of childhood and<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0677.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0671"/>
youth, &amp;c. as to ſuppoſe that their minds were created weak, uninformed, and uncivilized, as are thoſe of ſavages.</p><p>But if it be granted that Adam had a tolerable ſhare of knowledge, and ſome civilization, nothing can be more natural than to ſuppoſe that he would teach his deſcendants what he knew himſelf; and if the Scriptures are to be believed, we are certain that ſome of them poſſeſſed more than ſavage knowledge, and better than ſavage manners. But inſtead of going on to further perfection, as the theory of modern philoſophers would lead us to ſuppoſe, we find that mankind degenerated in a most aſtoniſhing degree; the cauſes of which we have already in part developed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism,</hi> n⁰ 4, &amp;c.</p><p>This early degeneracy of the human race, or their ſudden progreſs towards ignorance and ſavagiſm, appears to lead to an important conſequence. If men ſo very ſoon after their creation, poſſeſſing, as we have ſeen they did, a conſiderable ſhare of knowledge and of civilization, inſtead of improving in either, degenerated in both reſpects, it would not appear that human nature has that ſtrong propenſity to refinement which many philoſophers imagine; or that had all men been originally ſavage, they would have civilized themſelves by their own exertions.</p><p>Of the ages before the flood we have no certain account anywhere but in Scripture; where, though we find mankind repreſented as very wicked, we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe them to have been abſolute ſavages. On the contrary, we have much reaſon, from the ſhort account of Moſes, to conclude that they were far advanced in the arts of civil life. Cain, we are told, built a city; and two of his early deſcendants invented the harp and organ, and were artificers in braſs and iron. Cities are not built, nor muſical inſtruments invented, by ſavages, but by men highly cultivated: and ſurely we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the righteous poſterity of Seth were behind the apoſtate deſcendants of Cain in any branch of knowledge that was really uſeful. That Noah and his family were far removed from ſavagiſm, no one will controvert who believes that with them was made a new covenant of religion; and it was unqueſtionably their duty, as it muſt otherwiſe have been their wiſh, to communicate what knowledge they poſſeſſed to their poſterity. Thus far then every conſiſtent Chriſtian, we think, muſt determine againſt original and univerſal ſavagiſm.</p><p>In the preliminary diſcourſe to Sketches of the Hi- ſtory of Man, Lord Karnes would infer, from ſome facts which he ſtates, that many pairs of the human race were at firſt created, of very different forms and natures, but all depending entirely on their own natural talents. But to this ſtatement he rightly obſerves, that the Moſaic account of the Creation oppoſes inſuperable objections. “Whence then (ſays his Lordſhip) the degeneracy of all men into the ſavage ſtate? To account for that diſmal cataſtrophe, mankind muſt have ſuffered ſome dreadful convulſion. ” Now, if we mistake not, this is taking for granted the very thing to be proved. We deny that at any period ſince the creation of the world, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men were ſunk into the ſtate of ſavages; and that they were, no proof has yet been brought, nor do we know of any that can be brought, unleſs our faſhionable philoſophers chooſe to prop their</p><p>theories by the buttreſs of Sanchoniatho's Phenician coſmogony. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanchoniatho. )</hi> His Lordſhip, however, goes on to ſay, or rather to <hi rend="italic">ſuppoſe</hi> that the confuſion at Babel, &amp;c. was this dreadful convulſion: For, lays he, “by confounding the language of men, and ſcattering them abroad upon the face of all the earth, they were rendered ſavages.” Here again we have a poſitive aſſertion, without the leaſt ſhadow of proof; for it does not at all appear that the confuſion of language, and the ſcattering abroad of the people, was a circumſtance ſuch as could induce univerſal ſavagiſm. There is no reaſon to think that all the men then alive were engaged in building the tower of Babel; nor does it appear from the Hebrew original that the language of thoſe who were engaged in it was ſo much changed as the reader is apt to infer from our Engliſh verſion. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philology,</hi> n⁰ 8—16. ) That the builders were <hi rend="italic">ſcattered,</hi> is indeed certain; and if any of them were driven, in very ſmall tribes, to a great diſtance from their brethren, they would in proceſs of time inevitably become ſavages. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism,</hi> n° 4—6, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Language,</hi> n⁰ 7.); but it is evident, from the Scripture account of the peopling of the earth, that the deſcendants of Shem and Japheth were not ſcattered over the face of all the earth, and that therefore they could not be rendered ſavage by the cataſtrophe at Babel. In the chapter which relates that wonderful event, the generations of Shem are given in order down to Abram; but there is no indication that they had ſuffered with the builders of the tower, or that any of them had degenerated into the ſtate of ſavages. On the contrary, they appear to have poſſeſſed a conſiderable degree of knowledge; and if any credit be due to the tradition which repreſents the father of Abraham as a ſtatuary, and himſelf as ſkilled in the ſcience of aſtronomy, they muſt have been far advanced in the arts of refinement. Even ſuch of the poſterity of Ham as either emigrated or were driven from the plain of Shinar in large bodies, ſo far from sinking into ſavagiſm, retained all the accompliſhments of their antediluvian anceſtors, and became afterwards the inſtructors of the Greeks and Romans. This is evident from the hiſtory of the Egyptians and other eaſtern nations, who in the days of Abraham were powerful and highly civilized. And that for many ages they did not degenerate into barbariſm, is apparent from its having been thought to exalt the character of Moſes, that he was learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians, and from the wiſdom of Solomon having been ſaid to excel all the wiſdom of the eaſt country and of Egypt.</p><p>Thus decided are the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament againſt the univerſal prevalence of ſavagiſm in that period of the world; nor are the moſt authentic Pagan writers of antiquity of a different opinion. Mochus the Phenician<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*<hi rend="italic"></hi> Strabo, <hi rend="italic">lib. xvii.</hi> Diog. Laert. Vita Democ. et Vita Epicuri.</p></note> *, Democritus, and Epicurus, appear to be the firſt champions of the ſavage ſtate, and they are followed by a numerous body of poets and rhapſodiſts, among the Greeks and Romans, who were unqueſtionably devoted to fable and fiction. The account which they have given of the origin of man, the reader will find in another place (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology,</hi> Part i. ſect. 1. ): But we hardly think that he will employ it in ſupport of the faſhionable doctrine of original ſavagiſm. Againſt the wild reveries of this ſchool are poſted all the leaders of the other ſects, Greeks and barbarians; the philo-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0678.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0672"/>
ſophers of both Academies, the ſages of the Italian and Alexandrian ſchools; the magi of Perſia; the Framing of India, and the Druids of Gaul, &amp;c. The teſtimony of the early hiſtorians among all the ancient nations, indeed, who are avowedly fabuliſts, is very little to be depended on, and has been called in queſtion by the moſt judicious writers of Pagan antiquity. (See <hi rend="italic">Plutarch Vitα Theſ. ſub init. Thucyd,</hi> 1. I. cap. 1. <hi rend="italic">Strabo,</hi></p><p>1. II. p. 507. <hi rend="italic">Livy Preſ.</hi> and V <hi rend="italic">arro ap. August de Ciν. Dei.)</hi> The mere populous and extenſive kingdoms and ſocieties were civilized at a period prior to the records of profane hiſtory: the preſumption, therefore, without taking revelation into the account, certainly is, that they were civilized from the beginning. This is rendered further probable from other circumſtances. To account for their ſyſtem, the advocates of ſavagiſm are obliged, as we have ſeen, to have recourſe to numerous ſuppoſitions. They imagine, that ſince the creation dreadful convulſions have happened, which have ſpread ruin and devaſtation over the earth, which have deſtroyed learning and the arts, and brought on ſavagiſm by one ſudden blow. But this is reaſoning at random, and without a veſtige of probability: for the only convulſion that can be mentioned is that at Babel, which we have already ſhewn to be inadequate.</p><p>Further, it does not appear that any people who were once civilized, and in proceſs of time had degenerated into the ſavage or barbarous ſtate, have ever recovered their priſtine condition without foreign aid. From whence we conclude, that man, once a ſavage, would never have raiſed himſelf from that hopeleſs ſtate. This appears evident from the hiſtory of the world; for that it requires ſtrong incitements to keep man in a very high ſtate of knowledge and civilization, is evident from what we know of the numerous nations which were famed in antiquity, but which are now degenerated in an aſtoniſhing degree. That man cannot, or, which is the fame thing, has not riſen from barbariſm to civilization and ſcience by his own efforts and natural talents, appears further from the following facts. The rudiments of all the learning, religion, laws, arts, and ſciences, and other improvements that have enlightened Europe, a great part of Aſia, and the northern coaſt of Africa, were ſo many rays diverging from two points, on the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile. In proportion as nations receded from theſe two ſources of humanity and civilization, in the ſame proportion were they more and more immerſed in ignorance and barbariſm. The Greeks had made no progreſs towards civilization when the Titans firſt, and afterwards colonies from Egypt and Phenicia, taught them the very elements of ſcience and urbanity<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*See <hi rend="italic">Titan.</hi></p></note> *. The aborigines of Italy were in the ſame ſtate prior to the arrival of the Pelaſgi, and the colonies from Arcadia and other parts of Greece. Spain was indebted for the firſt ſeeds of improvement to the commercial ſpirit of the Phenicians. The Gauls, the Britons, and the Germans, derived from the Romans all that in the early periods of their hiſtory they knew of ſcience, or the arts of civil life, and ſo on of other nations in antiquity. The ſame appear s to be the cafe in modern times. The countries which have been diſcovered by the reſtleſs and inqniſitive ſpirit of Europeans have been generally found in the loweſt ſtate of ſavagiſm; from which, if they have emerged at all, it has been exactly in proportion to their connection with the inha</p><p>bitants of Europe. Even weſtern Europe itſelf, when ſunk in ignorance, during the reign of monkery, did not recover by the efforts of its own inhabitants. Had not the Greeks, who in the 15th century took refuge in Italy from the cruelty of the Turks, brought with them their ancient books, and taught the Italians to read them, we who are diſputing about the origin of the ſavage ſtate, and the innate powers of the human mind, had at this day been groſs and ignorant ſavages ourſelves, incapable of reaſoning with accuracy upon any ſubject. That we have now advanced far before our maſters is readily admitted; for the human mind, when put on the right track, and ſpurred on by emulation and other incitements, is capable of making great improvements: but between improving ſcience, and emerging from ſavagiſm, every one perceives there is an immenſe difference.</p><p>Lord Karnes obſerves, that the people who inhabit a grateful foil, where the neceſſaries of life are eaſily procured, are the ſirſt who invent uſeful and ingenious arts, and the ſirſt who figure in the exerciſes of the mind. But the Egyptians and Chaldeans, who are thought to ſupport this remark, appear from what we have ſeen to have derived their knowledge from their antediluvian progenitors, and not from any advantages of ſituation or ſtrength of genius. Beſides, the inhabitants of a great part of Africa, of North and South America, and of many of the iſlands lately diſcovered, live in regions equally fertile, and equally productive of the neceſſaries of life, with the regions of Chaldee and Egypt; yet theſe people have been ſavages from time immemorial, and continue ſtill in the ſame ſtate. The Athenians, on the other hand, inhabited the moſt barren and ungrateful region of Greece, while their perfection in the arts and ſciences has never been equalled. The Norwegian colony which ſettled in Iceland about the beginning of the 8th century, inhabited a moſt bleak and barren foil, and yet the fine arts were eagerly cultivated in that dreary region when the reſt of Europe was ſunk in ignorance and barbariſm. Again, there are many parts of Africa, and of North and South America, where the foil is neither ſo luxuriant as to beget indolence, nor ſo barren and ungrateful as to depreſs the ſpirits by labour and poverty; where, not- withſtanding, the inhabitants ſtill continue in an uncultured ſtate. From all which, and from numerous other inſtances which our limits permit us not to bring forward, we infer that ſome external influence is neceſſary to impel towards civilization ſavages; and that in, the hiſtory of the world, or the nature of the thing, we find no inſtance of any people emerging from barbariſm by the progreſſive efforts of their own genius. On the contrary, as we find in ſocieties highly cultivated and luxurious a ſtrong tendency to degenerate, ſo in ſavages we not only find no mark of tendency to improvement, but rather a rooted averſion to it. Among them, indeed, the ſocial appetite never reaches beyond their own horde. It is, therefore, too weak and too confined to diſpoſe them to unite in large communities; and of courſe, had all mankind been once in the ſavage ſtate, they never could have arrived at any conſiderable degree of civilization.</p><p>Inſtead of trailing to any ſuch natural progreſs, as is contended for, the Providence of Heaven, in pity to the human, race, appears at different times, and in dif-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0679.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0673"/>

Thus we find the Chineſe look up to their Fohee, the Indians to Brahma, the Perſians to Zoroaſter, the Chaldeans to Oanes, the Egyptians to Thoth, the Phenicians to Melicerta, the Scandinavians to Odin, the Italians to Janus, Saturn, and Picus, and the Peruvians to Manco. In later times, and almoſt within our own view, we find the barbarous nations of Ruſſia reduced to ſome order and civilization by the aſtoniſhing powers and exertions of Peter the Great. The endeavours of ſucceeding monarchs, and eſpecially’ of the preſent empreſs, have powerfully contributed to the improvement of this mighty empire. In many parts of it, however, we ſtill find the inhabitants in a ſtate very little ſuperior to ſavagiſm; and through the moſt of it, the lower, and perhaps the middling orders, appear to retain an almoſt invincible averſion to all further progreſs<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See</hi> Ruſſia.</p></note> *. A fact which, when added to numerous others of a ſimilar nature which occur in the hiſtory of the world, ſeems to prove indiſputably that there is no ſuch natural propenſity to improvement in the human mind as we are taught by ſome authors to believe. The origin of ſavagiſm, if we allow mankind to have been at firſt civilized, is eaſily accounted for by natural means: The origin of civilization, if at any period the whole race were ſavages, cannot, we think, be accounted for otherwiſe than by a miracle, or repeated miracles.</p><p>To many perſons in the preſent day, eſpecially, the doctrine we have now attempted to eſtabliſh, will appear very humiliating; and perhaps it is this alone that has prevented many from giving the ſubject ſo patient a hearing as its importance ſeems to require. It is a faſhionable kind of philoſophy to attribute to the human mind very pre-eminent powers; which ſo flatter our pride, as in a great meaſure, perhaps, to pervert our reaſon, and blind our judgment. The hiſtory of the world, and of the diſpenſations of God to man, are certainly at variance with the popular doctrine reflecting the origin of civilization: for if the human mind be poſſeſſed of that innate vigour which that doctrine attributes to it, it will be extremely difficult to account for thoſe numerous facts which ſeem, with irreſiſtible evidence to proclaim the contrary; for that unceaſing care with which the Deity appears to have watched over us; and for thoſe various and important revelations He has vouchſafed to us. Let us rejoice and be thankful that we are men, and that we are Chriſtians; but let not a vain philoſophy tempt us to imagine that we are angels or gods.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SAVAGE Iſland,</hi> one of the ſmall iſlands in the South Sea, lying in S.
