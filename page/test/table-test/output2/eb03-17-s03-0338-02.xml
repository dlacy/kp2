or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bedang,</hi> the name of a ſacred book, in high eſtimation among the idolaters of Hindostan, containing all the dogmas of the religion of the bramins, and all the ceremonies of their worſhip ; and ſerving as a commentary on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vedam.</hi></p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">Shaster</hi> denotes “ ſcience” or “ ſyſtem ;” and is applied to other works of aſtronomy and philoſophy, which have no relation to the religion of the Indians. None but the bramins and rajahs of India are allowed to read the Vedam; the prieſts of the Banians, called <hi rend="italic">ſhuderers,</hi> may read the Shaſter ; and the people, in general, are allowed to read only the Paran or Pouran, which is a commentary on the Shaſter.</p><p>The Shaſter is divided into three parts: the firſt containing the moral law of the Indians ; the ſecond, the rites and ceremonies of their religion ; and the third, the diſtribution of the people into tribes or claſſes, with the duties pertaining to each claſs.</p><p>The principal precepts of morality contained in the firſt part of the Shaſter are the following: that no animal be killed, becauſe the Indians attribute souls to brute animals as well as to mankind ; that they neither hear nor ſpeak evil, nor drink wine, nor eat fleſh, nor touch any thing that is unclean ; that they obſerve the feaſts, prayers, and waſhings, which their law preſcribes ; that they tell no lies, nor be guilty of deceit in trade ; that they neither oppreſs nor offer violence to one another; that they celebrate the ſolemn feaſts and fasts, and appropriate certain hours of ordinary ſleep to cultivate a diſpoſition for prayer ; and that they do not ſteal or defraud one another.</p><p>The ceremonies contained in the ſecond part of the Shaſter are ſuch as theſe : that they waſh often in the rivers, hereby obtaining the pardon of their sins ; that they mark their forehead with red, in token of their relation to the Deity ; that they preſent offerings and prayers under certain trees, ſet apart for this purpoſe ; that they pray in the temples, make oblations to their pagodas, or idols, sing hymns, and make proceſſions, &amp; c. that they make pilgrimages to diſtant rivers, and eſpecially to the Ganges, there to waſh themſelves and make offerings; that they make vows to particular ſaints, according to their reſpective departments ; that they render homage to the Deity at the firſt sight of the ſun ; that they pay their reſpect to the ſun and moon, which are the two eyes of the Deity ; and that they treat with particular veneration thoſe animals that are deemed more pure than others; as the cow, buffalo, &amp; c. ; becauſe the souls of men have tranſmigrated into theſe animals.</p><p>The third part of the Shaſter records the diſtribution of the people into four claſſes ; the firſt being that</p><p>of the bramins or prieſts, appointed to inſtruct the people ; the ſecond, that of the kutteris or nobles, who are the magiſtrates ; the third, that of the ſhudderis or merchants ; and the fourth, that of the mechanics. Each perſon is required to remain in the claſs in which he was born, and to purſue the occupation aſſigned to him by the Shaſter. According to the bramins, the Shaſter was imparted by God himſelf to Brahma, and by him to the bramins ; who communicated the contents of it to the people.</p><p>Modern writers have given us very different accounts of the antiquity and importance of the Shaſter. Mr ', who had made considerable progreſs in the tranſlation of this book, apprehends, that the mythology as well as the coſmogony of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, were borrowed from the doctrines of the bramins, contained in it, even to the copying of their exteriors of worſhip, and the diſtribution of their idols, though groſsly mutilated and adulterated. With reſpect to the Vedam and Shaſter, or ſcriptures of the Gentoos, this writer informs us, that V <hi rend="italic">edam,</hi> in the Malabar language, ſignifies the same as <hi rend="italic">Shaster</hi> in the Shanſcrit; and that the firſt book is followed by the Gentoos of the Malabar and Coromandel coaſts, and alſo of the iſland of Ceylon. The Shaſter is followed by the Gentoos of the provinces of Bengal, and by all the Gentoos of the rest of India, commonly called <hi rend="italic">India Proper,</hi> along the courſe of the rivers Ganges and Jumna to the Indus. Both theſe books (he says) contain the inſtitutes of their reſpective religion and worſhip, as well as the hiſtory of their ancient rajahs and princes, often couched under allegory and fable. Their antiquity is contended for by the partiſans of each ; but he thinks, that the ſimilitude of their names, idols, and great part of their worſhip, leaves little room to doubt, nay plainly evinces, that both theſe ſcriptures were originally one. He adds, if we compare the great purity and chaſte manners of the Shaſter with the great abſurdities and impurities of the Vedam, we need not hesitate to pronounce the latter a corruption of the former.</p><p>With regard to the high original of theſe ſcriptures, the account of the bramins is as follows. Brahma (that is, “ Mighty Spirit”), about 4866 years ago, aſſumed the form of man and the government of Indoſtan. He tranſlated the divine law (designed for the reſtoration of mankind, who had offended in a pre-exiſtent ſtate, and who are now in their laſt ſcene of probation, to the dignity from which they were degraded) out of the language of angels into the well known Shanſcrit language, and called his tranſlation the <hi rend="italic">Chartah Bhade Shastah of Birmah,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the Six Scriptures of Divine Words of the Mighty Spirit.</hi> He appointed the bramins, deriving their name from him, to preach the word of God; and the doctrines of the Shaſter were accordingly preached in their original purity 1000 years. About this time there was publiſhed a paraphraſe on the Chartali Bhade ; and about 500 years afterwards, a ſecond expoſition, called the <hi rend="italic">Aughtorrah Bhade Shasta,</hi> or E <hi rend="italic">ighteen Books oſ Divine Words,</hi> written in a character compounded of the common Indoſtan and the Shanſcrit. This innovation produced a ſchiſm among the Gentoos ; on which occaſion, it is said, thoſe of Coromandel and Malabar formed a ſcripture of their own, which they pretended to be founded on the Chartah<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0345.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0339"/>
Bhade of Bramah, and called it <hi rend="italic">the Vedam of Birmah,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Divine Words of the Mighty Spirit.</hi> The original Chartah Bhade was thrown aſide, and at length wholly unknown, except to a few families ; who can still read and expound it in the Shanſcrit character. With the eſtabliſhment of the Aughtorrah Bhade, and Vedam, which, according to the Gentoo account, is 3366 years ago, their polytheiſm commenced ; and the principles of religion became ſo obſcure, and their ceremonies ſo numerous, that every head of a family was obliged to keep a bramin as a guide both in faith and practice. Mr Hollwell is of opinion, that the Chartah Bhade, or Original Scriptures, are not copied from any other ſyſtem of theology, promulgated to or obtruded upon mankind. The Gentoos do not attribute them to Zoroaſter; and Mr Holwell ſuppoſes, that both Zoroaſter and Pythagoras viſited Indoſtan, not to inſtruct, but to be inſtructed.</p><p>From the account of Mr Dow, we Ram, that the books which contain the religion and philoſophy of the Hindoos are diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Bedas ;</hi> that they are four in number, and, like the ſacred writings of other nations, ſaid to be penned by the Divinity. Beda, he fays, in the Shanſcrit language, literally ſignifies <hi rend="italic">ſcience ;</hi> and theſe books treat not only of religion and moral duties, but of every branch of philoſophic knowledge. The bramins maintain, that the Bedas are the divine laws, which Brimha, at the creation of the world, delivered for the inſtruction of mankind ; but they affirm, that their meaning was perverted in the firſt age by the ignorance and wickedneſs of ſome princes, whom they repreſent as evil ſpirits, who then haunted the earth.</p><p>The firſt credible account we have of the Bedas is, that about the commencement of the Cal Jug, of which era the year 1768 was the 4886th year, they were written, or rather collected, by a great philoſopher and reputed prophet, called <hi rend="italic">Beaſs Muni,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Beaſs the Inspired.</hi></p><p>The Hindoos, ſays Mr Dow, are divided into two great religious ſects : the followers of the doctrine of Bedang, which is the original Shaster, or commentary upon the Bedas ; and thoſe who adhere to the principles of the Neadirſen. The original Shaster is called <hi rend="italic">Bedang,</hi> and is a commentary upon the Bedas. This book, he ſays, is erroneouſly called in Europe the V <hi rend="italic">edam.</hi> It is aſcribed to Beaſs Muni, and is ſaid to have been reviſed ſome years after by one Serrider "Swami, ſince which it has been reckoned ſacred, and not ſubject to any farther alterations.</p><p>Almoſt all the Hindoos of the Decan, and thoſe of the Malabar and Coromandel coaſts, are of this ſect. The followers of the Bedang Shaster do not allow that any phyſical evil exiſts ; they maintain that God created all things perfectly good ; but that man, being a free agent, may be guilty of moral evil, which may be injurious to himſelf, but can be of no detriment to the general ſyſtem of nature. God, they ſay, being perfectly benevolent, never puniſhed the wicked otherwiſe than by the pain and affliction which are the natural conſequences of evil actions ; and hell, therefore, is no other than a conſciouſneſs of evil.</p><p>The Neadirſen Shaſter is ſaid to have been written by a philoſopher called <hi rend="italic">Goutam,</hi> near four thouſand years ago. The bramins, from Mr Dow’s account of their</p><p>ſacred books, appear to believe invariably in the unity, eternity, omniſcience, and omnipotence of God ; and the polytheiſm of which they have been accuſed is no more than a ſymbolical worſhip of the divine attributes, which they divide into three claſſes. Under the name of <hi rend="italic">Brimha,</hi> they worſhip the wiſdom and creative power of God ; under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Bishen,</hi> his providential and preſerving quality ; and under that of <hi rend="italic">Shibah,</hi> that attribute which tends to deſtroy.</p><p>As few of our readers may have an opportunity of perusing the Shaſter, we ſhall, by way of ſpecimen, ſubjoin a paſſage from it, which, though it contains ſome metaphyſical myſteries concerning the creation, yet diſcovers views of God ſo enlightened that they would not diſgrace more refined nations. The paſſage which we ſhall quote is the firſt chapter of the Shaſter, which is a dialogue between Brimha the Wiſdom of the Divinity, and Narud or Reaſon, who is repreſented as the fort of Brimha. Narud deſires to be inſtructed by his father ; and for that purpoſe puts the following queſtions to him :</p><p><hi rend="italic">. “ Narud.</hi> O father ! thou firſt of God, thou art ſaid to have created the world, and thy ſon Narud, aſtoniſhed at what he beholds, is deſirous to be inſtructed how all theſe things were made.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> Be not deceived, my ſon ! do not imagine that I was the creator of the world, independent of the Divine Mover, who is the great original eſſence and creator of all things. Look, therefore, only upon me as the inſtrument of the great <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> and a part of his being, whom he called forth to execute his eternal deſigns.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> What ſhall we think of God ?</p><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> ti</hi> <hi rend="italic">Brimha.</hi> Being immaterial, he is above all conception ; being inviſible, he can have no form ; but, from what we behold in his works, we may conclude that he is eternal, omnipotent, knowing all things, and preſent everywhere.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> How did God create the world ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">Brimha.</hi> Affection dwelt with God from all eternity. It was of three different kinds ; the creative, the preſerving, and the deſtructive. This firſt is represented by Brimha, the ſecond by Biſhen, and the third by Shibah. You, O Narud ! are taught to worſhip all the three in various ſkapes and likeneſſes, as the Creator, the Preſerver, and the Deſtroyer. The affection of God then produced power, and power, at a proper conjunction of time and fate, embraced goodneſs, and produced matter. The three qualities then acting upon matter, produced the univerſe in the following manner : From the oppoſite actions of the creative and deſtructive quality in matter, ſelf-motion firſt aroſe. Self- motion was of three kinds ; the firſt inclining to plaſticity, the ſecond to diſcord, and the third to rest. The diſcordant actions then produced the Akaſh ( a kind of celestial element), which inviſible element poſſeſſed the quality of conveying found ; it produced air, a palpable element ; fire, a viſible element ; water, a fluid element; and earth, a ſolid element.</p><p>“ The Akaſh diſperſed itſelf abroad. Air formed the atmoſphere ; fire, collecting itſelf, blazed forth in the hoſt of heaven ; water roſe to the ſurface of the earth, being forced from beneath by the gravity of the latter element. Thus broke forth the world from the veil of darkneſs, in which it was formerly comprehend-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0346.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0340"/>
ed by God. Order roſe over the univerſe. The ſeven heavens were formed, and the ſeven worlds were fixed in their places; there to remain till the great diſſolution, when all things ſhall be abſorbed into God.</p><p>“ God seeing the earth in full bloom, and that vegetation was ſtrong from its seeds, called forth for the first time intellect, which he endued with various organs and ſhapes, to form a diversity of animals upon the earth. He endued the animals with five ſenſes; feeling, ſeeing, ſmeiling, tasting, and hearing ; but to man he gave reflection, to raiſe him above the beaſts of the field.</p><p>“ The creatures were created male and female, that they might propagate their ſpecies upon the earth. Every herb bore the ſeed of its kind, that the world might be clothed with verdure, and all animals provided with food.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> What doſt thou mean, O father ! by Intellect ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> It is a portion of the <hi rend="italic">great ſoui</hi> of the univerſe breathed into all creatures, to animate them for a certain time.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> What becomes of it after death ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> It animates other bodies, or returns, like a drop, into that unbounded ocean from which it firſt arofe.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> Shall not then the ſouls of good men receive rewards ? nor the souls of the bad meet with puniſhment ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> The ſouls of men are diſtinguished from thoſe of other animals ; for the firſt are endued with reaſon, and with a conſciouſneſs of right and wrong. If therefore man ſhall adhere to the firſt, as far as his powers ſhall extend, his soul, when diſengaged from the body by death, ſhall be abſorbed into the divine eſſence, and ſhall never more reanimate fleſh : But the ſouls of thoſe who do evil are not, at death, diſengaged from all the elements. They are immediately clothed with a body of fire, air, and akaſh, in which they are for a time puniſhed in hell. After the ſeaſon of their grief is over, they reanimate other bodies ; but till they ſhall arrive at a ſtate of purity they can never be abſorbed into God.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> What is the nature of that abſorbed ſtate which the ſouls of good men enjoy after death ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> It is a participation of the divine nature, where all paſſions are utterly unknown, and where conſciouſneſs is loſt in bliſs.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, O father, that unleſs the soul is perfectly pure it cannot be abſorbed into God : now, as the actions of the generality of men are partly good and partly bad, whither are their ſpirits font immediately after death ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> They muſt atone for their crimes in hell, where they muſt remain for a ſpace proportioned to the degree of their iniquities ; then they riſe to heaven to be rewarded for a time for their virtues ; and from thence they will return to the world to reanimate other bodies.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> What is time ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> Time exiſted from all eternity with God : but it can only be eſtimated ſince motion was produced, and only be conceived by the mind, from its own constant progreſs.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Narud.</hi> How long ſhall this world remain ?</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Brimha.</hi> Until the four lugs ſhall have revolved.</p><p>Then Rudder (the same with <hi rend="italic">Shihah,</hi> the deſtroying quality of God), with the ten ſpirits of diſſolution, ſhall roll a comet under the moon, that ſhall involve all things in fire, and reduce the world into aſhes. God ſhall then exiſt alone, for matter will be totally annihilated.”</p><p>Thoſe who deſire more information on this ſubject may conſult <hi rend="italic">Dow's Hiſtory of Indοstan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hοlwell's Intersting Historical Events.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
