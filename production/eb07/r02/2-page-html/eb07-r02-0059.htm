<p><span class="font0">Cordilleras. It is not certainly known whether any of them are volcanic. Pumice stones are often seen floating on the&nbsp;Mississippi, and still oftener on the Missouri. These are&nbsp;generally of a reddish yellow, or flame colour, and are&nbsp;amongst the largest and finest specimens of this substance&nbsp;to be met with. Some assert that they proceed from hills&nbsp;of burning coal, but we never heard of hills of burning coal&nbsp;ever yielding such a product. They are entirely a volcanic&nbsp;production, and beyond doubt are either discharged from&nbsp;craters at present active, or are washed away by the mountain torrents, from places which were formerly the scene of&nbsp;such phenomena. Mica is also abundantly carried along&nbsp;by the waters which flow from the Rocky Mountains. The&nbsp;great rivers that are discharged from their eastern and western declivities wind among the mountains, the Arkansas on&nbsp;the east, and the Oregon or Columbia on the west, more&nbsp;than a hundred leagues before they issue into the plains.&nbsp;In following the beds of such streams, travellers passthrough&nbsp;the range without much difficulty, so that the reports of the&nbsp;early travellers that they presented a high, continuous, and&nbsp;almost impassable barrier, are incorrect. Various leaders&nbsp;of expeditions have passed them at different points, and&nbsp;affirm that they found no such formidable and insurmountable barriers, the mention of which was wont to deter&nbsp;traders from attempting to cross from east to west or from&nbsp;west to east by this route. Following the river Platt, which&nbsp;is one of the principal southern branches of the Missouri,&nbsp;the traveller finds a road even to Lake Buenaventura, on&nbsp;the Pacific plains, that needs little labour to adapt it to the&nbsp;passage of horses and waggons. The acclivity is nowhere&nbsp;so great as to exceed an ascent of three degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This vast range has been divided into the Rocky, Chepy-wan, and Masserne Mountains, on what ground is not exactly kno¼<sup>r</sup>n. The ranges on the south, at the sources of the Arkansas, and running thence towards the Gulf of&nbsp;Mexico, are called the Masserne Mountains. A single peak&nbsp;of this ridge, seen as a landmark for immense distances&nbsp;over the subjacent plains, is called Mount Pike, a very appropriate name. It is described as of incomparable grandeur in appearance, and has been differently estimated at&nbsp;from seven to ten thousand feet in height. On the ridges&nbsp;of the Rocky Mountains, the Colorado of the Pacific, the&nbsp;Rio del Norte of Mexico, the Roche-jaune or Yellow-stone&nbsp;of the Missouri, and the Arkansas and Red River of the&nbsp;Mississippi, streams which have outlets at such immense&nbsp;distances apart, all have their origin. Many accounts have&nbsp;been given of the appearance of silver and other metals in&nbsp;the Rocky Mountains, but they have been too partially explored to entitle us to pronounce on the extent or value of&nbsp;the veins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r. r. r.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RODNEY, George Brydges, Lord Rodney, was bom on the 19th of February 1718. He was the descendant of&nbsp;an ancient family, and was related to the duke of Chandos.&nbsp;His father Henry Rodney obtained, at the age of fourteen,&nbsp;a commission as cornet of horse ; but having quitted the&nbsp;army after a short period of service, he settled at Walton-upon-Thames, and married Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Newton, envoy extraordinary to the&nbsp;grand duke of Tuscany, and afterwards judge of the court&nbsp;of admiralty. Through the interest of the duke, who usually attended the king on his journeys to and from Hanover, Mr Rodney obtained the command of the royal yacht ;&nbsp;and having on one of these occasions been asked what mark&nbsp;of favour he would wish the king to confer upon him, he&nbsp;requested that his majesty would stand sponsor for his&nbsp;son. Such a request was easily granted ; and accordingly&nbsp;his second son was named after his royal and noble godfathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At a very early age he was sent to Harrow school ; and having quitted it at the age of twelve, he received from the&nbsp;king a letter of service, the last ever granted, and went to&nbsp;sea On the Newfoundland station he served for six years&nbsp;with Admiral Medley. On the 15th of February 1739 he&nbsp;was made lieutenant in the Dolphin, by Admiral Haddock,&nbsp;in the Mediterranean, and served successively in the Essex,&nbsp;Royal Sovereign, and Namur. Admiral Mathews having&nbsp;in 1742 appointed him to the Plymouth of sixty-four guns,&nbsp;he convoyed three hundred sail of the Lisbon trade through&nbsp;the midst of the French fleet, then cruising in the channel ;&nbsp;and for his conduct on this occasion he received the warmest thanks of the merchants. In the rank of captain he was&nbsp;confirmed by the admiralty, and was appointed to the command of the Sheerness, in which he continued for eighteen&nbsp;months. He was then removed to the Ludlow Castle, of&nbsp;forty guns. In this ship he fought and took the great St&nbsp;Maloes privateer, of forty guns, and one hundred men above&nbsp;his own complement. From this period till December 1745,&nbsp;he was employed in various pieces of service, which afforded him no particular opportunities of obtaining distinction.&nbsp;Having been appointed to the Centurion, he for two years&nbsp;cruised in the North Sea ; and on that station he commanded while the pretender was in Edinburgh, and until&nbsp;the arrival of Admiral Byng. He was now promoted to the&nbsp;command of the Eagle, of sixty-four guns; and in 1747 he&nbsp;was despatched in a small squadron for the purpose of intercepting the French fleet, llomeward-bound from St Domingo. On the 20th of June they fell in with this fleet&nbsp;off Cape Ortegal. The French men-of-war deserted their&nbsp;convoy during the night, and no fewer than forty-eight&nbsp;merchantmen were captured. Rodney afterwards joined&nbsp;the squadron of Admiral Hawke, and bore a distinguished&nbsp;part in the action off Finisterre on the 14th of October in&nbsp;the same year. Near the close of this war, a small squadron, of which the Eagle was one, fell in with a Spanish&nbsp;fleet from the West Indies, consisting of twelve sail of the&nbsp;line with a rich convoy, and, notwithstanding their own inferiority, they took from them six sail of merchantmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Captain Rodney was appointed to the Rainbow in March 1748, and was soon afterwards sent as governor and commander-in-chief on the Newfoundland station. This was&nbsp;his first appearance with the rank of commodore. He had&nbsp;received particular instructions to discover, if possible, an&nbsp;island in the Western Ocean, said to be in lat. 49. N., about&nbsp;three hundred leagues from Britain. After cruising fourteen days to no purpose, he sailed for St John’s, the seat of&nbsp;his government. In this station he continued till the month&nbsp;of October 1752, when he returned home to take his seat&nbsp;in parliament, having been elected for the borough of&nbsp;Saltash.</span></p>
