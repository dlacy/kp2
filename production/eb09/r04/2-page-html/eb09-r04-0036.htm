<p><span class="font1">all members of the Romanoff family, because they were allied to the house of Rurik, and troubled his dreams of&nbsp;sovereignty. The head of this house was compelled to&nbsp;become a monk ; his son, however, was destined to ascend&nbsp;the throne. A famine broke out in 1601, which Boris was&nbsp;unsparing in his efforts to allay. In the midst of all this&nbsp;suffering a rumour spread that Dmitri, the youngest son&nbsp;of Ivan the Terrible, was not dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One day in the year 1603 Prince Adam Wisniowiecki, of Bragin in Lithuania, happening to be very angry with&nbsp;a servant, struck him and used an insulting epithet. The&nbsp;young man, with tears in his eyes, said, “If you knew&nbsp;who I am, you would not treat me so nor call me by&nbsp;that name.” “Who then are you, and whence do you&nbsp;come ? ” replied the astonished prince. “ I am the prince&nbsp;Dmitri, son of Ivan Vasilievich.” He then recounted a&nbsp;well-concocted tale of his miraculous escape from the&nbsp;assassin whom Boris had employed. This was his physician, who feigned compliance with the usurper’s designs,&nbsp;but only to frustrate them. On the night appointed for&nbsp;the murder, the man, whose name was Simon, put the&nbsp;son of a serf into his young master’s bed (who was&nbsp;accordingly killed), and immediately fled with Dmitri from&nbsp;Uglich. He was then committed to the care of a loyal&nbsp;gentleman, who thought it better for the sake of protection&nbsp;that he should enter a monastery. This gentleman and&nbsp;the physician were dead, but in confirmation of his story&nbsp;the false Dmitri exhibited a seal, bearing the arms and&nbsp;name of the prince, and a golden cross set with jewels&nbsp;which he said was the baptismal gift of his godfather,&nbsp;Prince Ivan Mstislavski. Wisniowiecki believed his tale.&nbsp;There were also other supposed signs. @@<sup>1</sup> The Polish nobles&nbsp;thronged around the young man, whose manners, as we&nbsp;read in the case of Perkin Warbeck, seemed to bear out&nbsp;his pretensions. Meanwhile Dmitri remained in Poland,&nbsp;enjoying all the lavish attentions of the Polish nobility.&nbsp;Boris was soon made acquainted with his appearance on&nbsp;the scene, and offered the brothers Wisniowiecki money&nbsp;and lands if they would surrender the impostor to him.&nbsp;Without, however, replying to these overtures, they removed&nbsp;him into the interior of Poland, and he was received with&nbsp;royal honours by George Mniszek, the palatine of&nbsp;Sandomir. Here he is said to have entered into a secret&nbsp;understanding with the Jesuits to bring over Russia to the&nbsp;Latin faith, on condition of being supported by the papal&nbsp;nuncio. @@<sup>2</sup> The pretender privately abjured the Greek faith,&nbsp;and signed a contract of marriage with Marina, the youngest&nbsp;daughter of Mniszek, by which he settled upon her the&nbsp;towns of Novgorod and Pskoff, and engaged to pay her&nbsp;father a million of florins as soon as he had ascended the&nbsp;throne. Afterwards he executed another treaty ceding&nbsp;Smolensk and the surrounding territory to Mniszek and&nbsp;the king of Poland. These proceedings were not likely to&nbsp;recommend him to his Russian subjects. For the present&nbsp;they were concealed, and Dmitri publicly professed the&nbsp;Greek ritual. Soon after this Sigismund of Poland saluted&nbsp;him as czar of Moscow, and assigned him a pension of&nbsp;40,000 florins. All this time Boris affected to regard the&nbsp;pretender with contempt, and issued a manifesto setting&nbsp;forth that his real name was Grishka (or Gregory)&nbsp;Otrepieff, a renegade monk. Whether this individual was&nbsp;•really the man who personated Dmitri, the son of Ivan,&nbsp;cannot be known for certain; but it seems very probable.&nbsp;Karamzin has adopted this view. Boris soon issued a&nbsp;proclamation against him, calling him an apostate monk,&nbsp;who wished to introduce the Latin heresy into Russia, and&nbsp;to build Romish churches in the Orthodox land. Dmitri&nbsp;entered that country ou the 3lst of October 1604, and&nbsp;marched on Moravsk in Tchernigoff. He met with uninterrupted success, large numbers joining his expedition, and&nbsp;the authorities of the chief towns on his route offering him&nbsp;bread and salt till he came to Novgorod Severski on the&nbsp;23d of November. This well-fortified place was defended&nbsp;by Basmanoff, a veteran captain, with five hundred streltzi&nbsp;On the arrival of the pretender he was summoned to&nbsp;capitulate, but, standing on the ramparts with a lighted&nbsp;match, he replied : “ The grand-prince and czar is at Moscow ; as for your Dmitri he is a robber, who shall be impaled, along with his accomplices.” After three months&nbsp;the invaders abandoned the siege, but they had the good&nbsp;fortune soon afterwards to seize a large sum of money which&nbsp;Boris was sending to some of the towns. Shortly after&nbsp;this the important fortresses of Putivl, Sievsk, and&nbsp;Voronezh surrendered to Dmitri. Boris was too ill to go&nbsp;in person against the impostor ; he, however, raised an&nbsp;army of fifty thousand men. A great battle took place&nbsp;near Novgorod, and the supporters of the czar would have&nbsp;suffered a most ignominious defeat had it not been for&nbsp;Basmanoff. This captain was recalled to Moscow and&nbsp;loaded with honours by Boris, who, from motives not very&nbsp;evident, unless he had begun to have suspicions of his&nbsp;fidelity, detained him in the city, and committed the care&nbsp;of the new army which he had formed to Shuiski, who&nbsp;was probably only half-hearted in his cause. A great&nbsp;battle took place on the 2d of January 1605, on the&nbsp;plain of Dobrînichi, not far from Orel; here Dmitri&nbsp;was defeated, chiefly through the bravery of the foreign&nbsp;legion. He would have been captured had it not been&nbsp;for the fidelity of his Cossack infantry—for at this time&nbsp;the Cossacks were subject to Poland—who were killed&nbsp;to a man, and probably not a fugitive would have&nbsp;reached Sievsk had not Shuiski acted with duplicity.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the pretender rode as fast as his horse would&nbsp;carry him to Putivl, a strong town on the frontier, from&nbsp;which he could easily beat a retreat into Poland. The&nbsp;followers of Boris remained at Dobrinichi, putting to death&nbsp;their prisoners. The conduct of Shuiski showed with what&nbsp;apathy he viewed the cause of his master ; he soon drew&nbsp;off his troops into winter quarters, alleging that nothing&nbsp;more could be done that season, and also wasted time&nbsp;before Kromî, an insignificant place. Meanwhile Dmitri&nbsp;corrupted some of the chief generals of Boris. An attempt&nbsp;to poison him soon afterwards failed, and the pretender&nbsp;sent a message to Boris, recommending him to descend&nbsp;from the throne which he had usurped. But the days of&nbsp;the latter were numbered. On the 13th of April 1605 he&nbsp;presided as usual at the council-board, and received some&nbsp;distinguished foreigners. A grand banquet was given, but&nbsp;suddenly after dinner he was seized with illness ; blood&nbsp;burst from his nose, ears, and mouth, and in the brief&nbsp;period before his death, according to the Russian custom,&nbsp;the dress of a monk was thrust upon him, and he was</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present writer doubts the genuineness of this claimant ;&nbsp;many authors, however, some of them contemporaries, were convinced that he was the real son of Ivan, and among these the first&nbsp;place must be assigned to the French mercenary captain Margeret,&nbsp;whose intimate relations with the man point him out as a valuable&nbsp;authority. This clever adventurer had entered the Russian service&nbsp;in the time of Boris Godunoff, and was a witness of the whole&nbsp;struggle. At first he led the troops of the latter against Dmitri, but&nbsp;when the pretender had established his authority he accepted a&nbsp;post in his service. He has given us an interesting portrait of&nbsp;Dmitri, of whom he speaks very favourably, in his work on Russia&nbsp;published at Paris in 1669.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@ 2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some authors, the whole plot had been concocted by&nbsp;the Jesuits for this purpose. For the contrary view, however, see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rome et Demetrius d’après des documents nouveaux avec pieces&nbsp;justificatives et facsimile,</span><span class="font0"> by Père Pierling, S. J., Paris, 1878. Gerard&nbsp;Muller tells us that the’pretender “ conversed in Latin and Polish with&nbsp;fluency ; ” if this had been the case his knowledge of the former would&nbsp;be easily explained by his Jesuitical training. Margeret, however,&nbsp;denies it altogether. “ Il est très certain qu’il ne parloit nullement&nbsp;Latin, j’en puis temoigner, moins le sçavoit-il lire et écrire ” (p. 163).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
