<p><label>RABIRIUS</label>
(C.) a Roman knight, who lent an im-menfe ſum of money to Ptolemy Auletes king of Egypt. The monarch afterwards not only refuſed to repay him, but even confined him, and endangered his life. Rabi-rius eſcaped from Egypt with difficulty ; but at his re-turn to Rome he was accuſed by the ſenate of having lent money to an African prince for unlawful purpoſes. He was ably defended by Cicero, and acquitted with difficulty.—There was a Latin poet of the ſame name in the age of Auguſtus. He wrote a poem on the victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at Actium. Seneca has compared him to virgil for ele-gance and majeſty ; but Quintilian is not fo favourable to his poetry. —And there was an architect in the reign of Domitian, called <hi rend="italic">Rabirius.</hi> He built a celebrated palace for the emperor, of which the ruins are ſtill feen at Rome.</p>
