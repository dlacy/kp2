a denomination given to all sorts of balls for fire-arms ; thoſe for cannon being of iron, and thoſe for guns, piſtols, &amp; c. of lead. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Shooting.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Caſe SHOT</hi> formerly conſiſted of all kinds of old iron, nails, muſket-balls, ſtones, &amp; c. uſed as above.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shot</hi> <hi rend="italic">of a Cable,</hi> on ſhip-board, is the ſplicing of two cables together, that a ſhip may ride ſafe in deep waters and in great roads; for a ſhip will ride easier by one ſhot of a cable, than by three ſhort cables out ahead.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Grape</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shot.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">GRAPE-Shot.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Patent milled SHoτ</hi> is thus made : Sheets of lead, whoſe thickneſs correſponds with the ſize of the ſhot required, are cut into ſmall pieces, or cubes, of the form of a die. A great quantity of theſe little cubes are put into a large hollow iron cylinder, which is mounted horizontally and turned by a winch ; when by their friction againſt one another and againſt the ſides of the cylinder, they are rendered perfectly round and very ſmooth. The other patent ſhot is caſt in moulds, in the ſame way as bullets are.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SHOT-Flaggon,</hi> a sort of flaggon ſomewhat bigger than ordinary, which in ſome counties, particularly Derbyſhire, it is the cuſtom for the hoſt to ſerve his gueſts in, after they have drank above a ſhilling.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Small SHoT,</hi> or that uſed for fowling, ſhould be well ſized, and of a moderate bigneſs : for ſhould it be too great, then it flies thin, and ſcatters too much ; or if too ſmall, then it hath not weight and ſtrength to penetrate far, and the bird is apt to fly away with it. In order, therefore, to have it ſuitable to the occaſion, it not being always to be had in every place fit for the purpoſe, we ſhall ſet down the true method of making all sorts and ſizes under the name of <hi rend="italic">mould-shot.</hi> Its principal good properties are to be round and ſolid.</p><p>Take any quantity of lead you think fit, and melt it down in an iron veſſel ; and as it melts keep it ſtirring with an iron ladle, ſkimming off all impurities whatſoever that may ariſe at the top : when it begins to look of a greeniſh colour, ſtrew on it as much auripigmentum or yellow orpiment, finely powdered, as will lie on a ſhilling, to every 12 or 14 pound of lead; then ſtirring them together, the orpiment will flame.</p><p>The ladle ſhould have a notch on one side of the brim, for more eaſily pouring out the lead ; the ladle muſt remain in the melted lead, that its heat may be the ſame with that of the lead, to prevent inconveniences which otherwiſe might happen by its being either too hot or too cold : then, to try your lead, drop a little of it into water, and if the drops prove round, then the lead is of a proper heat ; if otherwiſe, and the ſhot have- tails, then add more orpiment to increaſe the heat, till it be found ſufficient.</p><p>Then take a plate of copper, about the bigneſs of a trencher, which muſt be made with a hollowness in the middle, about three inches compaſs, within which muſt be bored about 40 holes according to the ſize of the ſhot which you intend to caſt: the hollow bottom ſhould, be thin ; but the thicker the brim, the better it will retain the heat. Place this plate on a frame of iron, over a tub or veſſel of water, about four inches from the water, and ſpread burning coals on the plate, to keep the lead melted upon it : then take ſome lead and pour it gently on the coals on the plate, and it will make its way through the holes into the water, and form itſelf into ſhot ; do thus till all your lead be run through, the holes of the plate, taking care, by keeping your coals alive, that the lead do not cool, and ſo ſtop up the holes.</p><p>While you are caſting in this manner, another perſon with another ladle may catch ſome of the ſhot, placing the ladle four or five inches underneath the plate in the water, by which means you will ſee if they are defective, and rectify them.</p><p>Your chief care is to keep the lead in a just degree of heat, that it be not ſo cold as to ſtop up the holes in your plate, nor ſo hot as to cauſe the ſhot to crack : to remedy the heat, you muſt refrain working till it is oſ a proper coolneſs ; and to remedy the coolneſs of your lead and plate, you muſt blow your fire ; obſerving, that the cooler your lead is, the larger will be your ſhot ; as the hotter it is, the ſmaller they will be.</p><p>After you have done caſting, take them out of the water, and dry them over the fire with a gentle heat, ſtirring them continually that they do not melt ; when dry, you are to ſeparate the great ſhot from the ſmall, by the help of a ſieve made for that purpoſe, according, to their ſeveral ſizes. But thoſe who would have very large ſhot, make the lead trickle with a flick out of the ladle into the water, without the plate.</p><p>If it ſtop on the plate, and yet the plate be not too cool, give but the plate a little knock, and it will run again ; care muſt be had that none of your implements be greaſy, oily, or the like ; and when the ſhot, being ſeparated, are found too large or too ſmall for your pur-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0452.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0446"/>
pose, or otherwiſe imperfect, they will serve again at the next operation.</p><p>The sizes of common ſhot for fowling are from N⁰ 1 to 6, and ſmaller, which is called muſtard feed, or duſt ſhot; but N⁰ 5 is ſmall enough for any ſhooting whatſoever. The <hi rend="smallcaps">N⁰</hi> 1 may be uſed for wild geeſe ; the N⁰ 2 for ducks, widgeons, and other water-fowl ; the N⁰ 3 for pheaſants, partridges after the firſt month, and all the fen- fowl ; the N⁰ 4 for partridges, woodcocks, &amp; c. ; and the N⁰ 5 for ſnipes and all the ſmaller birds.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Tin-Caſe</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shot,</hi> in artillery, is formed by putting a great quantity of ſmall iron ſhot into a cylindrical tin-box called a canniſter, that just fits the bore of the gun. Leaden bullets are ſometimes uſed in the ſame manner ; and it muſt be obſerved, that whatever number or ſizes of the ſhots are uſed, they muſt weigh with their cafes nearly as much as the ſhot of the piece.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
