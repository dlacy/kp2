barrenneſs, in opposition to fertility. It has been aſſerted by many authors, that all monſters produced by a mixture of different ſpecies of animals, ſuch as mules, are barren ; but this does not hold universally, even with the mule, which is the inſtance moſt generally adduced. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mule.</hi></p><p>Sterility in women ſometimes happens from a miſcarriage, or violent labour injuring ſome of the genital parts ; but one of the moſt frequent cauſes is the ſuppreſſion of the menstrual flux.—There are other cauſes ariſing from various diſeaſes incident to thoſe parts ; by which the uterus may be unfit to receive or retain the male ſeed ;—from the tubæ fallopianæ being too ſhort, or having loſt their erective power ; in either of which caſes no conception can take place ;—from univerſal debility and relaxation ; or a local debility of the genital ſyſtem ; by which means, the parts having lost their tone or contractile power, the fernen is thrown off immediately <hi rend="italic">post coitum ;—</hi> from imperforation of the vagina, the uterus, or the <hi rend="italic">tubae,</hi> or from diſeaſed ovas, &amp;c. Hence medical treatment can only’ avail in caſes ariſing from topical or univerſal debility ; in correcting irregularities of the menſtrual flux, or in removing tumors, cicatrices, or conſtrictions of the paſſage, by the art of ſurgery.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
