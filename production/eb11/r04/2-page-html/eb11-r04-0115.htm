                    to the ground. Its territory&nbsp;became the Roman province of Africa, while
                    Numidia, now&nbsp;ruled by the three sons of Massinissa, remained as an
                    allied&nbsp;state under Roman suzerainty, and served to protect the&nbsp;new
                    province against the raids of the desert tribes (see</span></p>

            <p><span class="font1">In Italy itself the Hannibalic war had been followed by important
                    changes. In the north the Celtic tribes paid for their sympathy with Hannibal by
                    the final loss of all separate political existence. Cispadane Gaul, studded
                    with&nbsp;colonies and flooded with Roman settlers, was rapidly&nbsp;Romanized.
                    Beyond the Padus (Po) in Polybius’s time Roman&nbsp;civilization was already
                    widely spread. In the extreme northeast the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last
                    of its kind, was&nbsp;founded in 181, to control the Alpine tribes, while
                    in&nbsp;the north-west the Ligurians were held in check by&nbsp;the colony of
                    Luna (180), and by the extensive settlements of Roman citizens and Latins made
                    on Ligurian&nbsp;territory in 173.@@<sup>1</sup> In southern Italy the
                    depression of&nbsp;the Greek cities on the coast, begun by the raids of
                    the</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Sabellian tribes, was completed by the repeated blows inflicted
                    upon them during the Hannibalic struggle Some of them
                        lost&nbsp;territory;@@<sup>2</sup> all suffered from a decline of population
                    and loss&nbsp;of trade; and their place was taken by such new Roman settlements
                    as Brundusium (Brindisi) and Puteoli (Pozzuoli).@@<sup>3</sup> In&nbsp;the
                    interior the southern Sabellian tribes suffered scarcely less&nbsp;severely. The
                    Bruttii were struck off the list of Roman allies,&nbsp;and nearly all their
                    territory was confiscated.@@<sup>4</sup> To the Apulians&nbsp;and Lucanians no
                    such hard measure was meted out; but their&nbsp;strength had been broken by the
                    war, and their numbers&nbsp;dwindled; large tracts of land in their territories
                    were&nbsp;seized by Rome, and allotted to Roman settlers, or occupied by Roman
                    speculators. That Etruria also suffered&nbsp;from declining energy, a dwindling
                    population, and the&nbsp;spread of large estates is clear from the state
                    of&nbsp;things existing there in 133. It was indeed in&nbsp;central Italy, the
                    home of the Latins and their nearest&nbsp;kinsmen, and in the new Latin and
                    Roman settlements&nbsp;throughout the peninsula that progress and activity
                    were</span></p>

                    200-133.—</span><span class="font1">Ever since the repulse of Pyrrhus from
                    Italy, Rome had been slowly drifting&nbsp;into closer contact with the Eastern
                    states. With one&nbsp;of the three great powers which had divided between them
                    the&nbsp;empire of Alexander, with Egypt, she had formed an alliance&nbsp;in
                    273, and the alliance had been cemented by the growth&nbsp;of commercial
                    intercourse between the two countries.@@<sup>5</sup> In&nbsp;228 her
                    chastisement of the Illyrian pirates had led&nbsp;naturally enough to the
                    establishment of friendly relations with some of the states of Greece proper. In
                    214&nbsp;the alliance between Philip V. and Hannibal, and the
                    former’s&nbsp;threatened attack on Italy, forced her into war with
                    Macedon,&nbsp;at the head of a coalition of the Greek states against him,
                    which&nbsp;effectually frustrated his designs against herself; at the
                    first&nbsp;opportunity, however (205), she ended the war by a&nbsp;peace which
                    left the position unchanged. The results&nbsp;of the war were not only to draw
                    closer the ties which bound&nbsp;Rome to the Greek states, but to inspire the
                    senate with a&nbsp;genuine dread of Philip’s restless ambition, and with a
                    bitter&nbsp;resentment against him for his union with Hannibal.
            The</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">events of the next four years served to deepen both these
                    feelings. In 205 Philip entered into a compact with&nbsp;Antiochus III. of Syria
                    for the partition between them&nbsp;of the dominions of Egypt,@@<sup>6</sup> now
                    left by the death of Ptolemy&nbsp;Philopator to the rule of a boy-king.
                    Antiochus was to take&nbsp;Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for
                    his share the&nbsp;districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of the Aegean and
                    the&nbsp;Greek islands. Philip no doubt hoped to be able to secure
                    these&nbsp;unlawful acquisitions before the close of the Second Punic
                    War&nbsp;should set Rome free to interfere with his plans. But
                    the&nbsp;obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of Pergamum and
                    the&nbsp;Rhodians upset his calculations. In 201 Rome made&nbsp;peace with
                    Carthage, and the senate had leisure to&nbsp;listen to the urgent appeal for
                    assistance which reached her from&nbsp;her Eastern allies. With Antiochus indeed
                    the senate was not&nbsp;yet prepared to quarrel; but with Philip the senate had
                    no&nbsp;thoughts of a peaceful settlement. Their animosity against him&nbsp;has
                    been deepened by the assistance he had recently rendered to&nbsp;Carthage.
                    Always an unsafe and turbulent neighbour, he&nbsp;would, if allowed to become
                    supreme in the Aegean, prove as&nbsp;dangerous to her interests in the East as
                    Carthage had been in&nbsp;the West. To cripple or at least to stay the growth of
                    Philip’s&nbsp;power was in the eyes of the senate a necessity; but it was
                    only&nbsp;by representing a Macedonian invasion of Italy as imminent&nbsp;that
                    they persuaded the assembly, which was longing&nbsp;for peace, to pass a
                    declaration of war@@<sup>7</sup> (200).</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The war began in the summer of 200 B.c., and, though the landing
                    of the Roman legions in Epirus was not followed, as&nbsp;had been hoped, by any
                    general rising against Philip,&nbsp;yet the latter had soon to discover that, if
                    they were&nbsp;not enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less
                    inclined&nbsp;actively to assist himself. Neither by force nor&nbsp;by diplomacy
                    could he make any progress south of&nbsp;Boeotia. The fleets of Pergamum and
                    Rhodes, now the&nbsp;zealous allies of Rome, protected Attica and watched
                    the&nbsp;eastern coasts. The Achaeans and Nabis of Sparta were&nbsp;obstinately
                    neutral, while nearer home in the north the Epirots&nbsp;and Aetolians
                    threatened Thessaly and Macedonia. His own&nbsp;resources both in men and in
                    money had been severely&nbsp;strained by his constant wars,@@<sup>8</sup> and
                    the only ally who could have&nbsp;given him effective assistance, Antiochus, was
                    fully occupied&nbsp;with the conquest of Coele-Syria. It is no wonder then
                    that,&nbsp;in spite of his dashing generalship and high courage, he
                    made&nbsp;but a brief stand. T. Quinctius Flamininus (consul&nbsp;198), in his
                    first year of command, defeated him on&nbsp;the Aous, drove him back to the pass
                    of Tempe, and in the next&nbsp;year utterly routed him at Cynoscephalae. Almost
                    at the same&nbsp;moment the Achaeans, who had now joined Rome, took
                    Corinth,&nbsp;and the Rhodians defeated his troops in Caria.@@<sup>9</sup>
                    Further&nbsp;resistance was impossible; Philip submitted, and early
                    the&nbsp;next year a Roman commission reached Greece with instructions to
                    arrange terms of peace. These were such as effectually&nbsp;secured Rome’s main
                    object in the war, the removal of all&nbsp;danger to herself and her allies from
                    Macedonian aggression.@@<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Philip was left in possession of his
                    kingdom, but was degraded&nbsp;to the rank of a second-rate power, deprived of
                    all possessions&nbsp;in Greece, Thrace and Asia Minor, and forbidden, as
                    Carthage&nbsp;had been in 201, to wage war without the consent of&nbsp;Rome,
                    whose ally and friend he now became.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The second point in the settlement now effected by Rome was the
                    liberation of the Greeks. The “ freedom of Greece ”&nbsp;was proclaimed at the
                    Isthmian games amid a scene of&nbsp;wild enthusiasm,@@<sup>11</sup> which
                    reached its height when two&nbsp;years later (194) Flamininus withdrew his
                    troops even&nbsp;from the “three fetters of Greece”—Chalcis,Demetrias&nbsp;and
                        Corinth.@@<sup>12</sup> There is no reason to doubt that, in acting
                    thus,&nbsp;not only Flamininus himself, but the senate and people at
                    home&nbsp;were influenced, partly at any rate, by feelings of
