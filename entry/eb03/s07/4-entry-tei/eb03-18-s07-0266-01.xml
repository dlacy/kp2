the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lilac,</hi> in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">diandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">monogynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 44th order, <hi rend="italic">Septaria.</hi> The corolla is quadrifid, and the capſule is bilocular. There are three ſpecies, the vulgaris, persica, and ſuſpenſa. The two first are natives of Perſia, and the laſt of Japan.—The vulgaris, which is diſtinguiſhed by ovate heart-ſhaped leaves, was cultivated in Britain about the year 1597 by Mr John Gerard.—The <hi rend="italic">persica,</hi> which has lanceolate leaves, was cultivated in 1658; but how long both ſpecies might have been introduced into Britain before theſe dates, it is perhaps impoſſible to aſcertain.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
