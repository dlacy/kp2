The war thus commenced, commonly termed the Social war, raged for the space of three years, the allies being as well disciplined and led as the Romans themselves ; and many very sanguinary battles were fought, in which Rome sustained several severe defeats, and was for a time exposed to great danger. In this war, Cato, Marius, and the elder Pompey, greatly distinguished themselves ; but the chief glory was unquestionably reaped by Sylla, who proved himself to be possessed of abilities of the very first order, equally as a politician and a warrior. The bloody struggle was at length terminated, rather by Roman policy than Roman arms. The freedom of the city was first granted to those states which had aided Rome ; it was then offered to those who should first discontinue hostilities ; and finally, it was given to the whole of the Italian states ; so that whosoever was a citizen of any free town in Italy, became a citizen of Rome, provided he lodged his claim within sixty days after ; and in this manner even many foreigners were subsequently admitted to Roman citizenship.</p><p>To counterbalance the influence of these new citizens, and to preserve to those resident in Rome itself the preponderance of political power, the new citizens were formed into only eight tribes, completing the number of thirty-five, of which they formed but a small minority, even when joined by the six turbulent city tribes. It was, however, a complete revolution, and tended to infuse a more healthy vitality into the Roman constitution, which it might have prolonged, had it not already been corrupt at the very core.</p><p>Before the entire termination of the Social war, another arose in a different quarter of the world, by w hich the strength of Rome was severely tried. The bequest of Attalus king of Pergamus had given to the Romans extensive and wealthy dominions in Asia; and had at the same time stimulated their ambition and their avarice by the still more extensive regions which it placed almost within theirgrasp. The Grecian,or rather Macedonian empire had sunk before the growing power of Rome ; and out of its ruins various monarchies arose, one of the most considerable of which was that of Pontus. For a time it remained tributary to its more powerful neighbours, till under Mithridates the Great, it became sufficiently strong not only to reduce the adjacent kingdoms, but even to wage an even-handed warfare against Rome itself for a number of years. Mithridates, seeing Rome weakened by the Social war, deemed it a convenient juncture to make himself master of her Asiatic dominions, and prosecuted his undertaking with such vigour and success, that he had subdued the whole of Asia Minor, and all tlle adjacent islands, with the exception of Rhodes, before the .Romans were sufficiently at leisure to attend to his movements, occupied as they were with civil broils and social wars. But tl&gt;.e loss of their rich Asiatic territories was what the cupidity of neither senate nor people could brook ; and upon the termination of the Social war, all parties were equally eager to commence hostilities against Mithridates, anticipating vast wea'th from the pillage of these opulent regions. Marius and Sylla warmly contended for the command of this important war ; but the fame recently acquired by the latter in the war of the allies, enabled him to triumph over his rival. Scarcely had Sylla been nominated to the command, when fresh tumults arose in Rome, instigated by the envy of Marius, and the daring and lawless conduct of Sulpicius, tribune of the people. The object of these new tumults was to procure sufficient popular influence to remove Sylla from the command to which he had been appointed ; and they were so far successful, that while he was yet in Campania with the army destined for Asia, a decree was passed in an assembly of the people, transferring the command to Marius. But Sylla’s army were too much devoted to their general to submit to this capricious change. They put to death the commissioners who came to deprive him of his office ; and Sylla, confiding in their adherence to him, marched directly on Rome, obtained possession of it, and put to the sword without mercy all those who had rendered themselves conspicuous by their support of his rival. Sulpicius was slain, notwithstanding the law which declared the person of a tribune inviolable ; and it was with the utmost difficulty, and after sustaining innumerable hardships, and experiencing almost incredible hair-breadth escapes, that Marius himself eluded the keen pursuit of his enemies.</p><p>Sylla having thus crushed the opposite faction, and proscribed Marius, his son, and his chief adherents, re-established the power of the senate, and appointed his friend Octavius, and his enemy Cinna, to the consulship, set out against Mithridates. The relief of Greece was the first object of Sylla ; and this he accomplished after taking Athens by storm, atld defeating the armies of Mithridates in two great battles. Weakened and dispirited by these reverses, the king of Pontus readily concluded a treaty with the Roman general, who, on his part, was equally desirous of a peace, tllat he might return to Rome, where the Marian taction had regained the ascendancy.</p><p>Sylla had probably expected to produce a comparative equilibrium at Rome, by the appointment to the consulship of one from each of the contending tactions. Here, however, his policy failed, probably from being too refined, or from his not taking into consideration the new element which had been introduced, by the admission of the Italian states to the citizenship. He had in a great measure exterminated the democratic party in Rome itself, and restored the power of the senate ; but Cinna perceived the means of raising a powerful body of new adherents, by proposing to throw open all the tribes to the Italian states, which would have given them a preponderance in every popular assembly. This the other consul, Octavius, opposed ; and Cinna was compelled to withdraw to the country, where he soon mustered a powerful army of the disaffected allies. Marius, who had fled to Africa, being informed of the turn which affairs had taken at Rome, conceived hopes of recovering his power, and immediately returned to Italy, joined Cinna, and at the head of an immense horde of robbers and semi-barbarians, the very dregs of the populace -of all Italy, who flocked to his standard from all quarters, advanced against the city. At his approach Rome was thrown into consternation ; and there not being any forces sufficient to oppose him, the senate offered to capitulate, on condition that the lives of the opposite party should be spared. During the progress of these negotiations, Marius entered the city at tbe head of his armed and barbarous adherents, secured the gates that none might escape, and gave the signal for slaughter. On rushed his barbarians like wolves, sparing neither age nor sex, while Marius gazed on the horrid scene with grim and savage delight. During five days and five nights, the hideous massacre was continued with relentless ferocity, while the streets were deluged with blood, and the heads of the mur--dered victims were exhibited in the Forum, or laid before the monster himself fbr his peculiar gratification. Atlength Cinna grew sick of the protracted butchery ; hut the barbarians of Marius could not be restrained till they were themselves surrounded and cut to pieces by Cinna’s soldiers.</p><p>Having gratified his revenge with this bloody butchery, Marius nominated himself consul for the seventh time, and chose Cinna to be his colleague, This he did without the formalities of a public assembly, as if to consummate his triumph over the liberties of his country, thus trampled upon by an act at once of violation and of insult. But a short time did he enjoy his triumph and revenge. In the seventeenth day of lus seventh consulate, and in the seventieth year of his age, be expired, leaving behind him the charac</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
