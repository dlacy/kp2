<p><span class="font0">quillity. They voluntarily submitted to that conqueror, from whom they experienced great favour ; but no sooner&nbsp;did they hear of his death than they took up arms against&nbsp;the Macedonian garrisons, and expelled them. About this&nbsp;period the city of Rhodes and the inhabitants suffered severely from a dreadful inundation, which was accompanied&nbsp;with violent showers of rain ; and hailstones of an extraordinary size beat down many houses, and killed a number of the&nbsp;inhabitants. By the bursting of the wall the extraordinary&nbsp;accumulation of water was allowed a free passage to the&nbsp;sea, by which the danger was removed. From the effects&nbsp;of this unexpected disaster the Rhodians quickly recovered, by their close application to navigation and trade ;&nbsp;and during the wars that took place among Alexander’s&nbsp;successors they observed a strict neutrality, and gradually&nbsp;grew to be one of the most opulent states of the age. They&nbsp;were, however, connected in strict alliance with Ptolemy of&nbsp;Egypt, with whom Antigonus being at war, he demanded&nbsp;succours of them, which they refusing, drew on themselves&nbsp;the full weight of his hostility. He accordingly sent his son&nbsp;Demetrius with an immense armament provided with all&nbsp;sorts of machines for war and sieges, and an army of 40,000&nbsp;troops, who laid siege to their city. This remarkable siege&nbsp;lasted for a year, and called forth on the part of the Rhodians the most brilliant efforts of valour and patriotism.&nbsp;Demetrius, with all his knowledge of the known resources&nbsp;of war, and all his skill to invent new machines of unheard-of power and magnitude, was finally repulsed, with a prodigious slaughter of his bravest troops, and the loss of his military fame. The Rhodians after this siege applied themselves as before to commerce and navigation, and Rhodes&nbsp;became a flourishing city. In the year 203 before the&nbsp;Christian era the Rhodians were engaged in a war with&nbsp;Philip of Macedon, in which being assisted by the Romans,&nbsp;it was terminated to their advantage. In the wars that followed with the Romans and Antiochus, and afterwards with&nbsp;Mithridates, the Rhodians were useful allies of the former,&nbsp;whom they assisted with their naval power. In the civil&nbsp;wars of Rome they aided Pompey against Cæsar; and&nbsp;after his death they joined Caesar, which drew on them the&nbsp;resentment of Cassius, by whom their city was taken and&nbsp;plundered. Their privileges were restored by Marc Antony ; but the island was finally reduced into a Roman&nbsp;province during the reign of Vespasian. Rhodes continued&nbsp;under the Roman dominion, and was little heard of in history, till, on the downfall of the eastern empire, the island&nbsp;became one of the last retreats of the knights of Jerusalem,&nbsp;under whose rule it became illustrious by its heroic resistance to the Turkish conquerors, then at the utmost height&nbsp;of their power. They baffled by their valour the efforts of&nbsp;Mahommed II., the conqueror of Constantinople ; and they&nbsp;sustained a memorable and sanguinary siege from Solyman&nbsp;the Great, who invested the city with a fleet of 400 sail&nbsp;and 140,000 troops. He was often repulsed by the brave&nbsp;knights with great slaughter ; and he only made his way&nbsp;over the ruins of the city by the effect of numbers. A capitulation was at length agreed upon, by which the island&nbsp;was surrendered to the Turks, under whose dominion it has&nbsp;ever since continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rhodes is the capital of the above island, and stands on the site of the ancient city, though it is not above the fourth&nbsp;part of its extent. It is situated to the north-east of the&nbsp;island ; and from a distance, its advantageous position at the&nbsp;extremity of a promontory, its magnificent buildings, the&nbsp;strength and solidity of its walls, and its towers planted on&nbsp;rising rocks, still impress an idea of its ancient grandeur.&nbsp;The interior of the city does not correspond to its outward&nbsp;appearance. Those ancient streets which were laid out&nbsp;with such art and on so great a scale, and that uniform series of buildings which were monuments of taste, have been&nbsp;succeeded by narrow winding streets, and buildings without grace, ornament, or regularity. There are still some&nbsp;monuments which testify that the island was once possessed&nbsp;by the knights of Rhodes, namely, their arms, and the several busts of the grand-masters, which were engraved on&nbsp;marble, and still adorn the fronts of several buildings ; the&nbsp;walls and towers also bear marks of their heroic resistance&nbsp;to the Ottoman arms. But there is no longer any monument of its grandeur in times of antiquity ; there is no&nbsp;theatre, no magnificent temples nor spacious porticoes. The&nbsp;statues, colossi, and paintings for which Rhodes was famed&nbsp;in the early ages of Greece and Rome, have all been removed. Not a vestige is to be seen of the colossus described as seventy cubits high, and reckoned one of the&nbsp;wonders of the world. The streets bear everywhere marks&nbsp;of desolation. One half of the houses in the city are in&nbsp;ruins, and one half in the suburbs are uninhabited, though&nbsp;those occupied by the Greek inhabitants are beautiful, consisting of good stone houses, with gardens well stocked with&nbsp;all the fruits of the climate. On the declivity of the neighbouring hills are about 400 country houses, the residences&nbsp;of the principal inhabitants. The principal buildings which&nbsp;remain are the church of St John, which is become the&nbsp;principal mosque ; the hospital, whence the charity of the&nbsp;knights was liberally dispensed to the faithful from all quarters of the world, which has been transformed into public granaries ; the palace of the grand-master, falling into&nbsp;ruins and almost deserted ; and the senate-house, which&nbsp;still contains some marbles and ancient columns. Of the&nbsp;streets the best and widest is a long street which preserves&nbsp;the name of Rue des Chevaliers. It is perfectly straight,&nbsp;and formed of old houses, on which remain the armorial&nbsp;bearings of the members of the order. On some of these&nbsp;buildings are still seen the arms of the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes has at present two harbours. The least of these, towards the east, is named Dorca, and its entrance is obstructed by a barrier of rocks, so as to admit the entrance&nbsp;of one ship at a time. It is sufficiently sheltered from the&nbsp;winds by high moles ; but by the negligence of the Turks&nbsp;the sand has been suffered to accumulate until the entrance&nbsp;has been gradually choked up ; and merchant-ships can&nbsp;only enter after being obliged previously to unload their&nbsp;cargoes. The other harbour is larger, and bears the name&nbsp;of Rhodes ; here frigates of thirty guns may anchor, and&nbsp;are sheltered from the west winds, though they are in danger of being dashed against the walls of the city, or the&nbsp;rocks, from the north and north-east winds. The two harbours are separated by a mole which runs obliquely into the&nbsp;sea ; the two extremities are defended by towers 800 feet&nbsp;apart, while in the centre of the mole is a square tower 120&nbsp;feet high. There is a dock-yard, which, like every other department of the public service, is a scene of disorder and corruption. The population consists of 5000 Turks and about&nbsp;1000 Jews.
