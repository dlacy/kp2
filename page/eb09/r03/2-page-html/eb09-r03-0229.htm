<p><span class="font0">nevertheless which could give a wider scope to artistic enterprise. Spain and the United Provinces were for a&nbsp;time at peace ; almost all the churches had been stripped&nbsp;of their adornments ; monastic orders were powerful and&nbsp;richly endowed, guilds and corporations eager to show the&nbsp;fervour of their Catholic faith, now that the “ monster of&nbsp;heresy ” seemed for ever quelled. Here were opportunities&nbsp;without number for painters as well as sculptors and&nbsp;architects. Gothic churches began to be decorated according to the new fashion adopted in Italy. Altars magnified&nbsp;to monuments, sometimes reaching the full height of the&nbsp;vaulted roof, displayed, between their twisted columns,&nbsp;pictures of a size hitherto unknown. No master seemed&nbsp;better fitted to be associated with this kind of painting&nbsp;than Rubens, whose works we have already met with in&nbsp;churches newly erected at Rome, Genoa, and Mantua, by&nbsp;the Jesuits, in the gorgeous style which bears their name,&nbsp;and which Rubens commends in the preface to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palazzi&nbsp;di Genova</span><span class="font0"> (Antwerp, 1622). The temple erected by the&nbsp;reverend fathers in Antwerp was almost entirely the&nbsp;painter’s work, and if he did not, as we often find asserted,&nbsp;design the front, he certainly was the inspirer of the whole&nbsp;building, which, after all, was but a reminiscence of the&nbsp;churches in Genoa. And the temple of the Jesuits in&nbsp;Antwerp remained for a century the only example of its&nbsp;kind in Belgium. Hitherto no Fleming had undertaken&nbsp;to paint ceilings with foreshortened figures, and blend the&nbsp;religious with the decorative art after the style of those&nbsp;buildings which are met with in Italy, and owe their decorations to masters like Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto. No&nbsp;less than forty ceilings were composed by Rubens, and&nbsp;painted under his direction in the space of two years.&nbsp;All were destroyed by fire in 1718. Sketches in watercolour were taken some time before the disaster by De&nbsp;Wit, and from these were made the etchings by Punt which&nbsp;alone enable us to form a judgment of the grandiose undertaking. In the Madrid Gallery we find a general view of&nbsp;the church in all its splendour. The present church of&nbsp;St Charles in Antwerp is, externally, with some alteration,&nbsp;the building here alluded to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens delighted in undertakings of the vastest kind. “ The large size of a picture,” he writes to W. Trumbull in&nbsp;1621, “gives us painters more courage to represent our&nbsp;ideas with the utmost freedom and semblance of reality.&nbsp;.... I confess myself to be, by a natural instinct,&nbsp;better fitted to execute works of the largest size.” The&nbsp;correctness of this appreciation he was very soon called&nbsp;upon to demonstrate most strikingly by a series of twenty-four pictures, illustrating the life of Mary de’ Medici,&nbsp;queen-mother of France. The gallery at the Luxembourg&nbsp;Palace, which these paintings once adorned, has long since&nbsp;disappeared, and the complete work is now exhibited in&nbsp;the Louvre. Drawings, it seems, had been asked from&nbsp;Quentin Varin, the French master who incited Poussin to&nbsp;become a painter, but Rubens was ultimately preferred.&nbsp;This preference may in some degree be ascribed to his&nbsp;former connexion with the court at Mantua, Mary de’&nbsp;Medici and the duchess of Gonzaga being sisters. The&nbsp;story of Mary de’ Medici may be regarded as a poem in&nbsp;painting, and no person conversant with the literature of&nbsp;the time can fail to recognize that strange mixture of the&nbsp;sacred and the mythological in which the most admired&nbsp;authors of the 17th century, beginning with Malherbe,&nbsp;delight. Absolutely speaking, Mrs Jameson may be right&nbsp;in criticizing Rubens’s “ coarse allegories, historical improprieties, &lt;kc.”; but a man belongs to his time, and uses its&nbsp;language in order to make himself understood. From the&nbsp;crad'e to the day of her reconciliation with Louis XIII.,&nbsp;we follow Mary de’ Medici after the manner in which it&nbsp;vzas customary in those days to consider personages of&nbsp;superior rank. The Fates for her have spun the silken and&nbsp;golden thread; Juno watches over her birth and intrusts&nbsp;her to the town of Florence ; Minerva, the Graces, and&nbsp;Apollo take charge of her education ; Love exhibits her&nbsp;image to the king, and Neptune conveys her across the seas;&nbsp;Justice, Health, and Plenty endow her son ; Prudence and&nbsp;Generosity are at her sides during the regency; and, when&nbsp;she resigns the helm of the state to the prince, Justice,&nbsp;Strength, Religion, and Fidelity hold the oars. The&nbsp;sketches of all these paintings—now in the Munich&nbsp;Gallery—were painted in Antwerp, a numerous staff of&nbsp;distinguished collaborators being intrusted with the final&nbsp;execution. But the master himself spent much time in&nbsp;Paris, retouching the whole work, which was completed&nbsp;within less than four years. On May 13, 1625, Rubens&nbsp;writes from Paris to his friend Peiresc that both the queen&nbsp;and her son are highly satisfied with his paintings, and&nbsp;that- Louis XIII. came on purpose to the Luxembourg,&nbsp;“ where he never has set foot since the palace was begun&nbsp;sixteen or eighteen years ago.” We also gather from this&nbsp;letter that the picture representing the Felicity of the&nbsp;Regency was painted to replace another, the Departure of&nbsp;the Queen, which had caused some offence. “ If I had&nbsp;been let alone,” he says, “ the other subjects would have&nbsp;been better accepted by the court, and without scandal or&nbsp;murmur.” “ And I fear,” he adds, “ far greater difficulties&nbsp;will be found with the subjects of the next gallery.”&nbsp;Richelieu gave himself some trouble to get this part of the&nbsp;work, intended to represent the life of Henry IV., bestowed&nbsp;upon Cavalier d’Arpina, but did not succeed in his endeavours. The queen’s exile, however, prevented the undertaking from going beyond a few sketches, and two or three&nbsp;panels, one of which, the Triumph of Henry IV., now in&nbsp;the Palazzo Pitti, is one of the noblest works of Rubens&nbsp;or of any master. Most undoubtedly the painter here&nbsp;calls to his aid his vivid recollections of the Triumph of&nbsp;Cæsar by Mantegna, now at Hampton Court, but in his&nbsp;day adorning the palace at Mantua ; of this he made a&nbsp;copy, inscribed No. 315 in the catalogue of his effects&nbsp;sold in 1640, and now in the National Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the Ilth of May 1625 Rubens was present at the nuptials of Henrietta Maria at Notre Dame in Paris, when&nbsp;the scaffolding on which he stood gave way, and he tells&nbsp;us he was just able to catch an adjoining tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No painter in Europe could now pretend to equal Rubens either in talent or in renown. Month after&nbsp;month productions of amazing size left the Antwerp studio ;&nbsp;and to those unacquainted with the master’s pictures magnificent engravings by Vorsterman, Pontius, and others&nbsp;had conveyed singularly striking interpretations. “ Whatever work of his I may require,” writes Moretus, the celebrated Antwerp printer, “ I have to ask him six months&nbsp;before, so as that he may think of it at leisure, and do the&nbsp;work on Sundays or holidays ; no week days of his could&nbsp;I pretend to get under a hundred florins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the numerous creations of his pencil, none, perhaps, will more thoroughly disclose to us his comprehension of&nbsp;religious decorative art than the Assumption of the Virgin&nbsp;at the high altar of the Antwerp cathedral, finished in&nbsp;1625. It is, of twenty repetitions of this subject, the only&nbsp;example still preserved at the place it was intended by the&nbsp;painter to occupy. In spirit we are here reminded of&nbsp;Titian’s Assunta in the cathedral at Verona, but Rubens’s&nbsp;proves perhaps a higher conception of the subject. The&nbsp;work is seen a considerable way off, and every outline is&nbsp;bathed in light, so that the Virgin is elevated to dazzling&nbsp;glory with a power of ascension, scarcely, if ever, attained&nbsp;by any master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Able to rely so greatly on his power as a colourist, Rubens is not a mere decorator. He penetrates into the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
