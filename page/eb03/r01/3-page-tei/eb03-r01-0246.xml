About this time happened a dreadful inundation at Rhodes ; which, being accompanied with violent ſtorms of rain, and hailſtones of an extraordinary bigneſs, beat down many houſes, and killed great numbers of the inhabitants. As the city was built in the form of an amphitheatre, and no care had been taken to clear the pipes and conduits which conveyed the water into the ſea, the lower parts of the city were in an inſtant laid under water, ſeveral houſes quite covered, and the inha-bitants drowned before they could get to the higher places. As the deluge increaſed, and the violent ſhowers continued, ſome of the inhabitants made to their ſhips, and abandoned the place, while others miſerably periſhed in the waters. But while the city was thus threatened with utter deſtruction, the wall on a ſudden burſt aſunder, and the water diſcharging itſelf by a violent current into the ſea, unexpectedly delivered the inhabitants from all danger.</p><p>The Rhodians ſuffered greatly by this unexpected accident, but ſoon retrieved their loſſes by a cloſe application to trade. During the wars which took place among the ſucceſſors of Alexander, the Rhodians ob-ſerved a ſtrict neutrality ; by which means they enriched themſelves ſo much, that Rhodes became one of the moſt opulent ſtates of that age ; inſomuch that, for the common good of Greece, they undertook the <hi rend="italic">piratic war,</hi>  and, at their own charge, cleared the ſeas of the pirates who had for many years infeſted the coaſts of Europe and Aſia. However, notwithſtanding the neu-trality they profeſſed, as the moſt advantageous branch-es of their commerce were derived from Egypt, they were more attached to Ptolemy, king of that country, than to any of the neighbouring princes, when there-fore Antigonus, having engaged in a war with Ptolemy about the iſland of Cyprus, demanded ſuccours of them, they earneſtly intreated him not to compel them to de-clare war againſt their ancient friend and ally. But this anſwer, prudent as it was, drew upon them the diſpleaſure of Antigonus, who immediately ordered one of his admirals to ſail with his fleet to Rhodes, and ſeize all the ſhips that came out of the harbour for Egypt. The Rhodians, finding their harbour blocked up by tlie fleet of Antigonus, equipped a good number of galleys, fell upon the enemy, and obliged him, with tlie loſs of many ſhips, to quit his ſtation. Hereupon Antigonus, charging them as aggreſſors, and beginners -of an unjuſt war, threatened to beſiege their city with the ſtrength of his whole army. The Rhodians endeavoured by frequent embaſſies to appeaſe his wrath ; but all their remonſtrances ſerved rather to provoke than allay his reſentment : and the only terms upon which he would hearken to any accommodation were, that the Rhodians ſhould declare war againſt Ptolemy, that they ſhould admit his fleet into their harbour, and that an hundred of the chief citizens ſhould be delivered up to him as hoſtages for the performance of theſe articles. The Rhodians ſent ambaſſadors to all their allies, and to Ptolemy in particular, imploring their aſſiſtance, and repreſenting to the latter, that their attachment to his intereſt had drawn upon them the danger to which they were expoſed. The prepartions on both ſides were immenſe. As Antigonus was near fourſcore years of age at that time, he committed the whole management of the war to his ſon Demetrius, who appeared before the city of Rhodes with 200 ſhips of war, 170 tranſ-ports having on board 40,000 men, and 1000 other veſſels laden with proviſions and all ſorts of warlike engines. As Rhodes had enjoyed for many years a pro-found tranquillity, and been free from all devaſtations, the expectation of booty, in the plunder of ſo wealthy a city, allured multitudes of pirates and mercenaries to join Demetrius in this expedition ; inſomuch that the whole ſea between the continent and the iſland was covered with ſhips ; which ſtruck the Rhodians, who had a proſpect of this mighty armada from the walls, with great terror and conſternation.</p><p>Demetrius, having landed his troops without the reach of the enemy’s machines, detached ſeveral ſmall bodies to lay waſte the country round the city, and cut down the trees and groves, employing the timber, and materials of the houſes without the walls, to fortify his camp with ſtrong ramparts and a treble paliſade ; which work, as many hands were employed, was finiſhed in a few days. The Rhodians, on their part, prepared for a vigorous defence. Many great commanders, who had ſignalized themſelves on other occaſions, threw themfelves into the city, being deſirous to try their ſkill in military affairs againſt Demetrius, who was reputed one of the moſt experienced captains in the conduct of ſieges that antiquity had produced. The beſieged began with diſmiſſing from the city all ſuch perſons as were uſeleſs ; and then taking an account of thoſe who were capable of bearing arms, they found that the citizens amounted to 6000, and the foreigners to 1000. Liberty was promiſed to all the ſlaves who ſhould diſtinguiſh themſelves by any glorious action, and the public engaged to pay the maſters their full ranſom. A proclamation was likewiſe made, declaring, that whoever died in defence of their country ſhould be buried at the expence of the public ; that his parents and children ſhould be maintained out of the treaſury ; that fortunes ſhould be given to his daughters ; and his ſons, when they were grown up, ſhould be crowned and preſented with a complete ſuit of armour at the great ſolemnity of Bacchus ; which decree kindled an incre-dible ardour in all ranks of men.</p><p>Demetrius, having planted all his engines, began to batter with incredible fury the walls on the ſide of the harbour ; but was for eight days ſucceſſively repulſed by the beſieged, who ſet ſire to moſt of his warlike en-gines, and thereby obliged him to allow them ſome reſpite, which they made good uſe of in repairing the breaches, and building new walls where the old ones were either weak or low. when Demetrius had repaired his engines, he ordered a general aſſault to be made, and cauſed his troops to advance with loud ſhouts, thinking by this means to ſtrike terror into the enemy. But the beſieged were ſo ſar from being intimidated, that they repulſed the aggreſſors with great ſlaughter, and performed the moſt aſtoniſhing feats of bravery. Demetrius returned to the aſſault next day ; but was in the fame manner forced to retire, after having loſt a great number of men, and ſome officers of diſtinction. He had ſeized, at his ſirſt landing, an eminence at a fmall diſtance from the city ; and, having fortified this advantageous poſt, he cauſed ſeveral batteries to be erected there, with engines, which inceſſantly diſcharged</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
