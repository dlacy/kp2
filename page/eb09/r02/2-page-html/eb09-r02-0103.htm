<p><span class="font1">RICHARD III. (1452-1485), king of England, third son of Richard, duke of York, and Cicely Nevil, was born&nbsp;at Fotheringay on October 2, 1452. Having been sent&nbsp;out of England for safety on the death of his father in&nbsp;1460, he was recalled next year by his brother Edward&nbsp;IY., who created him duke of Gloucester and appointed&nbsp;him lord high admiral. He remained faithful to his&nbsp;brother during the latter’s reign, sharing in his flight in&nbsp;1470, and aiding him on his return in the victories of&nbsp;Barnet and Tewkesbury. In 1474 he married Anne,&nbsp;daughter of the earl of Warwick and widow of Prince&nbsp;Edward. In 1482 he led an army into Scotland to aid&nbsp;the duke of Albany against James III., occupied Edinburgh and captured Berwick. On the death of Edward&nbsp;IV. (April 9, 1483) Richard at once made himself master&nbsp;of the situation by seizing Prince Edward, his nephew.&nbsp;Having assumed the title of Protector, he rapidly developed his plans for securing the crown. Under the pretext of a plot against his life, he seized and beheaded&nbsp;Hastings, Grey, and others (June 13), forced the queen&nbsp;mother to give up her younger son Richard, and, on June&nbsp;26, 1483, assumed the crown. The children of Edward&nbsp;IV. were set aside on the plea that their father was&nbsp;illegitimate. On July 6 Richard w<sup>τ</sup>as crowned king.&nbsp;Shortly afterwards it was publicly reported that the sons&nbsp;of Edward IV. were dead ; their actual fate is to the&nbsp;present day unknown. In October 1483 the rebellion of&nbsp;the duke of Buckingham was put down ; the duke himself&nbsp;was executed on November 2. A parliament which met&nbsp;in January 1484 acknowledged Richard as king, in return&nbsp;for which he assented to an Act abolishing benevolences.&nbsp;His only legitimate son, Edward, died on April 9, 1484,&nbsp;and in March 1485 the boy was followed by his mother.&nbsp;To strengthen his position Richard had made treaties with&nbsp;Scotland and Brittany (1484), and he now proposed to&nbsp;marry his niece Elizabeth. From this course, however,&nbsp;he was dissuaded. His short reign was mainly occupied&nbsp;in preparing to resist the invasion of Henry of Richmond.&nbsp;L<sup>τ</sup>nable to prevent Henry’s landing (August 7, 1485),&nbsp;Richard met his rival in battle at Bosworth (August 22),&nbsp;and at the same moment lost his crown and his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tradition is divided as to Richard’s personal appearance, and the story of his deformity is possibly derived from Lancastrian malignity and from a misunderstanding&nbsp;of his nickname Crouchback. His courage, energy, and&nbsp;ability would have made a great and honoured name had&nbsp;not those qualities been matched by extreme ferocity and&nbsp;unscrupulousness, and perverted to an evil use by the turbulente of the time and his own nearness to the throne.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICHARD, earl of Cornwall and king of the Romans (1209-1272), second son of John, king of England, and&nbsp;IsabeLla, was born at Winchester, January 5, 1209. In&nbsp;1225 he undertook the government of Gascony. In 1240&nbsp;he went on a crusade, returning in 1241, after concluding a&nbsp;treaty with the sultan of Egypt. In 1242 he accompanied&nbsp;his brother on his unsuccessful expedition to Poitou.&nbsp;In 1244 and 1246 we find him heading the parliamentary&nbsp;opposition against Henry III., and a few years afterwards he&nbsp;befriended Simon de Montfort against his accusers. When&nbsp;Henry went to France in 1253, Richard, together with the&nbsp;queen, acted as regent. He had already (1252) declined&nbsp;the pope’s offer of the kingdom of Sicily, but in January&nbsp;1257 he was elected emperor by a majority of the electors,&nbsp;and soon afterwards was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle.&nbsp;In 1259 he returned to England and swore to observe&nbsp;the Provisions of Oxford. Next year he acted as peacemaker between Henry and the barons, and, after spending another year in Germany, he returned to England in&nbsp;1263. It was largely owing to his mediation that the&nbsp;two parties submitted to the arbitration of Louis IX., but&nbsp;on the renewal of the civil war he took his brother’s side.&nbsp;Taken prisoner at the battle of Lewes, he was kept in&nbsp;confinement by De Montfort for a year, but released after&nbsp;the battle of Evesham. One of his last known acts was&nbsp;his mediation between the earl of Gloucester and the&nbsp;king. In 1269 he went to Germany again for a short&nbsp;time, and returned to England to die at Kirkham in 1272.&nbsp;He was thrice married—(1) to Isabella, sister of the earl&nbsp;of Pembroke ; (2) to Sancia, daughter of Raymond, count&nbsp;of Provence ; (3) to Beatrice of Falkenstein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICHARD of Bury. See Aungervyle, Richard. RICHARD of Cirencester (1335-1401), historical</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">writer, was a member of the Benedictine abbey at Westminster, and his name (“ Circestre ”) first appears on the chamberlain’s list of the monks of that foundation&nbsp;drawn up in the year 1355. In the year 1391 he obtained&nbsp;a licence from the abbot to go to Rome, his design being&nbsp;to visit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limina Apostolorum,</span><span class="font1"> and in this licence the abbot&nbsp;gives his testimony to Richard’s perfect and sincere observance of religion for upwards of thirty years. In 1400&nbsp;Richard was in the infirmary of the abbey, where his&nbsp;death took place in the following year. His only known&nbsp;extant work is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Historiale de Gestis Regurn&nbsp;Angliæ, IH<sub>f</sub>7-1066.</span><span class="font1"> The manuscript of this is in the&nbsp;university library at Cambridge, and has been edited for&nbsp;the Master of the Rolls by Professor John E. B. Mayor&nbsp;(2 vols., 1863-1869). It is in four books, and at the conclusion of the fourth book Richard expresses his intention&nbsp;of continuing his narrative from the accession of William&nbsp;I., and incorporating a sketch of the Conqueror’s career&nbsp;from his birth. This design he does not, however, appear&nbsp;to have carried into effect. The value of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum</span><span class="font1"> as&nbsp;a contribution to our historical knowledge is but slight,&nbsp;for it is mainly a compilation from Rodger Wendover,&nbsp;Geoffrey of Monmouth, William of Malmesbury, Florence,&nbsp;Asser, Henry of Huntingdon, and other writers; while&nbsp;even in transcribing these the compiler is guilty of great&nbsp;carelessness. He gives, however, numerous charters relating to Westminster Abbey, and also a very complete&nbsp;account of the saints whose tombs were in the abbey&nbsp;church, and especially of Edward the Confessor, with&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>hose reign the fourth book is entirely occupied. The&nbsp;work was, notwithstanding, largely used by historians and&nbsp;antiquaries, until, with the rise of a more critical spirit,&nbsp;its value became more accurately estimated. Besides the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum</span><span class="font1"> Richard also wrote, according to the statement&nbsp;of William Woodford in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font1"> to Wickliffe (Brown,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fasciculus Rerum expetendarum,</span><span class="font1"> p. 193), a treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Offi,ciis</span><span class="font1"> ; and there was formerly in the cathedral library</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
