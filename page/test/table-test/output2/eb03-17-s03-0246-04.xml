a city of Croatia, belonging to the houſe of Auſtria, and ſeated on the coaſt of the Gulph of Venice. It was formerly a place of ſtrength and great importance; but it has ſuffered many calamities, and its inhabitants at preſent do not amount to 7000. In the beginning of this century it ſent 50 merchant ſhips to ſea; but the inconveniency of its ſituation and badneſs of its harbour, in which the ſea is never calm, diſcouraged navigation, and Segna has now very few ſhips belonging to it. Among the cuſtoms of the Segnans, Mr Fortis mentions one relative to the dead, which for its Angularity may be worthy of notice.</p><p><note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Fortis's Travels into Dalmatia.</p></note> “All the relations and friends of the family go to kiſs the corpſe, by way of taking leave, before burial. Each of them uncovers the face, over which a handkerchief is ſpread, more or leſs rich according to the family; having kiſſed the dead perſon, every one throws another handkerchief over the face; all which remain to the heirs, and sometimes there are 20, 30, and more at this ceremony. Some throw all theſe handkerchiefs into the grave with the corpſe; and this, in former times, was the general cuſtom; but then they were rich.
