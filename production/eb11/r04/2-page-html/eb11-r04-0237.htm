<p><span class="font2">the rebellion of 1641, and whose son, Sir Lawrence Parsons (d. 1698), was made a baronet in 1677. This Sir Lawrence was&nbsp;a strong Protestant, and was found guilty of high treason, being&nbsp;attainted and sentenced to death during the brief period of&nbsp;James II.’s ascendancy in Ireland. He was not executed,&nbsp;however, and afterwards he took some part in the struggle&nbsp;against the supporters of James II. His descendant, Lawrence&nbsp;Harman Parsons (1749-1807), was created Baron Oxmantown&nbsp;in 1792, Viscount Oxmantown in 1795, and earl of Rosse in 1806.&nbsp;He died on the 20th of April 1807, and was succeeded by his&nbsp;nephew Lawrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lawrence Parsons, 2nd earl of Rosse (1758-1841), the eldest son of Sir William Parsons, bart. (d. 1791), of Birr Castle, was&nbsp;born on the 21st of May 1758. Educated at Trinity College,&nbsp;Dublin, he entered the Irish parliament as member for the&nbsp;university in 1782, and soon came to the front in debate. A&nbsp;friend and follower of Henry Flood, he has been described as&nbsp;“ one of the very, very few honest men in the Irish House of&nbsp;Commons.” He favoured some measure of relief to Roman&nbsp;Catholics and also parliamentary reform, a speech which he&nbsp;delivered on this question in 1793 being described by W. E. H.&nbsp;Lecky as <sup>0</sup> exceedingly valuable to students of Irish history”;&nbsp;but he disliked and opposed the union of the parliaments of&nbsp;Great Britain and Ireland. After this event, however, he&nbsp;represented King’s County in the united parliament until 1807,&nbsp;and he was a representative peer for Ireland from 1809 to 1841.&nbsp;He died at Brighton on the 24th of February 1841. Rosse&nbsp;wrote </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Observations on the Bequest of Henry Flood to Trinity&nbsp;College, Dublin, with a Defence of the Ancient History of Ireland&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Dublin, 1795). His eldest son was the astronomer William&nbsp;Parsons, 3rd earl of Rosse (see below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSSE, WILLIAM PARSONS, 3RD </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Earl of (1800-1867), Irish astronomer and telescope constructor, was born at York on&nbsp;the 17th of June 1800, a son of the 2nd earl (see above). Until&nbsp;his father’s death he was known as Lord Oxmantown. Entered&nbsp;at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1818, he proceeded to Magdalen&nbsp;College, Oxford, in 1821, and in the same year he was returned&nbsp;as M.P. for King’s County, a seat which he resigned in 1834.&nbsp;He was Irish representative peer from 1845, president of the&nbsp;British Association in 1843, president of the Royal Society from&nbsp;1849 to 1854, and chancellor of the university of Dublin from&nbsp;1862. From 1827 he devoted himself to the improvement of&nbsp;reflecting telescopes; in 1839 he mounted a telescope of 3 ft.&nbsp;aperture at his seat, Birr Castle, Parsons town; and in February&nbsp;1845 his celebrated 6-foot reflector was finished. Owing to&nbsp;the famine and the disturbed state of the country, which demanded his attention as a large landowner and lieutenant of&nbsp;King’s County (from 1831), the instrument remained unused&nbsp;for nearly three years, but since 1848 it has been in constant&nbsp;use, chiefly for observations of nebulae, for which it was particularly suited on account of its immense optical power,&nbsp;nominally 6000. Lord Rosse died at Monkstown on the 31st&nbsp;of October 1867. He had four sons. The eldest, Lawrence&nbsp;Parsons, 4th earl of Rosse, and Baron Oxmantown, born on the&nbsp;17th of November 1840, succeeded to the title on his father’s&nbsp;death, and made many investigations on the heavenly bodies,&nbsp;particularly on the radiation of the moon and related physical&nbsp;questions; the youngest, the Hon. Charles Algernon Parsons,&nbsp;born oh the 13th of June 1854, is famous for his commercial&nbsp;development of the steam turbine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ The first constructor of reflecting telescopes on a large scale, Wiliam Herschel, never published anything about his methods of&nbsp;easting and polishing specula, and he does not appear to have&nbsp;been very successful beyond specula of 18 in. diameter, his 4-foot&nbsp;speculum (“ the 40-foot telescope ”) having been little used by him&nbsp;(see discussion between Sir J. Herschel and Robinson in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Athenaeum,</span><span class="font2"> Nos.. 831-36, 1843). Lord Rosse had therefore no help&nbsp;towards his brilliant results. His speculum metal is composed of&nbsp;four atoms of copper (126*4 parts) and one of tin (58*9 parts), a&nbsp;brilliant alloy, which resists tarnish better than any other compound&nbsp;tried. Chiefly owing to the brittleness of this material, Lord Rosse’s&nbsp;first larger specula were composed of a number of thin plates of&nbsp;speculum metal (sixteen for a 3-foot mirror) soldered on the back </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;strong but light framework made of a peculiar kind of brass (2*75 of&nbsp;copper to 1 of zinc), which has the same expansion as his speculum&nbsp;metal. In Brewster’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Journal of Science</span><span class="font2"> for 1828 he&nbsp;described his machine for polishing the speculum, which in all&nbsp;essential points remained unaltered afterwards. It imitates the&nbsp;motions made in polishing a speculum by hand by giving both a&nbsp;rectilinear and a lateral motion to the polisher, while the speculum&nbsp;revolves slowly; by shifting two eccentric pins the course of the&nbsp;polisher can be varied at will from a straight line to an ellipse of&nbsp;very small eccentricity, and a true parabolic figure can thus be&nbsp;obtained. The speculum lies face upwards in a shallow bath of&nbsp;water (to preserve a uniform temperature), and the polisher fits&nbsp;loosely in a ring, so that the rotation of the speculum makes it&nbsp;revolve also, but more slowly. Both the grinding and polishing&nbsp;tools are grooved, to obtain a uniform distribution of the emery&nbsp;used in the grinding process and of the rouge employed in polishing,&nbsp;as also to provide for the lateral expansion of the pitch with which&nbsp;the polisher is coated. In September 1839 a 3-foot speculum was&nbsp;finished and mounted on an altazimuth stand similar to Herschel’s;&nbsp;but, though the definition of the images was good (except that the&nbsp;diffraction at the joints of the speculum caused minute rays in the&nbsp;case of a very bright star), and its peculiar skeleton form allowed&nbsp;the speculum to follow atmospheric changes of temperature very&nbsp;quickly, Lord Rosse decided to cast a solid 3-foot speculum. Hitherto&nbsp;it had been felt as a great difficulty in casting specula that the&nbsp;solidification did not begin at one surface and proceed gradually&nbsp;to the other, the common sand mould allowing the edges to cool&nbsp;first, so that the central parts were subject to great straining when&nbsp;their time of cooling came, and in large castings this generally caused&nbsp;cracking. By forming the bottom of the mould of hoop iron placed&nbsp;on edge and closely packed, and the sides of sand, while the top was&nbsp;left open, Lord Rosse overcame this difficulty, and the hoop iron&nbsp;had the further advantage of allowing the gas developed during the&nbsp;cooling to escape, thus preventing.the speculum from being full of&nbsp;pores and cavities. This invention secured the success of the&nbsp;casting of a solid 3-foot speculum in 1840, and encouraged Lord&nbsp;Rosse to make a speculum of 6 ft. diameter in 1842. In the&nbsp;beginning of 1845 this great reflector was mounted and ready for&nbsp;work. The instrument has a focal length of 54 ft. and the tube is&nbsp;about 7 ft. in diameter; owing to these large dimensions it cannot&nbsp;be pointed to every part of the heavens, but can only be moved a&nbsp;short distance from the meridian and very little to the north of the&nbsp;zenith; these restrictions have, however, hardly been felt, as there&nbsp;is almost at any moment a sufficient number of objects within its&nbsp;reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From 1848 to 1878 it was but with few interruptions employed for observations of nebulae (see Nebula); and many previously&nbsp;unknown features in these objects were revealed by it, especially&nbsp;the similarity of “ annular ” and “ planetaiy ” nebulae, and the&nbsp;remarkable “ spiral ” configuration prevailing in many of the&nbsp;brighter nebulae. A special study was made of the nebula of Orion,&nbsp;and the resulting large drawing gives an extremely good representation of this complicated object. (See Telescope.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lord Rosse gave a detailed account of the experiments which step by step had led to the construction of the 3-foot speculum in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font2"> for 1840. In the same publication&nbsp;for 1844 and 1850 he communicated short descriptions and drawings&nbsp;of some of the more interesting nebulae, and in the volume for 1861&nbsp;he published a paper “ On the Construction of Specula of 6-ft.&nbsp;Aperture, and a Selection from the Observations of Nebulae made&nbsp;with them,” with numerous engravings. The accounts'of the&nbsp;observations given in these papers, however, were fragmentary;&nbsp;but in 1879-80 a complete account of them was published by the&nbsp;present earl (“ Observations of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars made&nbsp;with the 6-foot and 3-foot Reflectors at Birr Castle from 1848 to&nbsp;1878 ”) in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scient.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSSELLI, COSIMO </span><span class="font2">(1439-c. 1507), Florentine painter, was born in 1439. At the age of fourteen he became a pupil of&nbsp;Neri di Bicci, and in 1460 he worked as assistant to his cousin&nbsp;Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli. The first work of Cosimo mentioned by Vasari exists in S. Ambrogio, in Florence, over the&nbsp;third altar on the left. It is an “ Assumption of the Virgin,” a&nbsp;youthful and feeble work. In the same church, on the wall&nbsp;of one of the chapels, is a fresco by Cosimo which Vasari praises&nbsp;highly, especially for a portrait of the young scholar Pico of&nbsp;Mirandola. The scene, a procession bearing a miracle-working&nbsp;chalice, is painted with much vigour and less mannerism than&nbsp;most of this artist’s work. A picture painted by Rosselli for&nbsp;the church of the Annunziata, with figures of SS. Barbara,&nbsp;Matthew and the Baptist, is in the Academy of Florence.&nbsp;Rosselli also spent some time in Lucca, where he painted several&nbsp;altar-pieces for various churches. A picture attributed to him,&nbsp;taken from the church of S. Girolamo at Fiesole, is now in the&nbsp;National Gallery of London. It is a large retable, with, in the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
