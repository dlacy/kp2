He visited England and painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III., now in the Museum, Amsterdam, is a good example. In this work he shows an effect of candlelight, which he also introduced—frequently with fine effect— in many of his subject-pictures. These may be studied in the collections at Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna and Dresden. His Scriptural subjects are of very indifferent merit. He died at The Hague in 1706.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
