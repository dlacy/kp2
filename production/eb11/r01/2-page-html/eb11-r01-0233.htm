<p><span class="font0">Luther’s, imply the sympathy of the civil authorities. Charles V. had valiantly opposed the development of heresy in the Netherlands, and nowhere else had there been such numbers of martyrs,&nbsp;for some thirty thousand are supposed to have been put to death&nbsp;during his reign. Under Philip II. it soon became almost&nbsp;impossible to distinguish clearly between the religious issues&nbsp;and the resistance to the manifold tyranny of Philip and his&nbsp;representatives. William of Orange, who had passed through&nbsp;several phases of religious conviction, stood first and foremost&nbsp;for toleration. Indeed, Hofland became the home of modern&nbsp;religious liberty, the haven of innumerable free spirits, and the&nbsp;centre of activity of printers and publishers, who asked for no&nbsp;other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imprimatur</span><span class="font0"> than the prospect of intelligent readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is impossible to offer any exhaustive classification of those who, while they rejected the teachings of the old Church,&nbsp;refused at the same time to conform to the particular&nbsp;types of Protestantism which had found favour in&nbsp;the eyes of the princes and been imposed by them on their&nbsp;subjects. This large class of “ dissenters ” found themselves&nbsp;as little at home under a Protestant as under a Catholic&nbsp;regime, and have until recently been treated with scant&nbsp;sympathy by historians of the Church. Long before the&nbsp;Protestant revolt, simple, obscure people, under the influence&nbsp;of leaders whose names have been forgotten, lost confidence&nbsp;in the official clergy and their sacraments and formed secret&nbsp;organizations of which vague accounts are found in the reports&nbsp;of the 13th-century inquisitors, Rainerus Sacchoni, Bernard&nbsp;Gui, and the rest. Their anti-sacerdotalism appears to have&nbsp;been their chief offence, for the inquisitors admit that they were&nbsp;puritanically careful in word and conduct, and shunned all&nbsp;levity. Similar groups are mentioned in the town chronicles&nbsp;of the early 16th century, and there is reason to assume that&nbsp;informal evangelical movements were no new things when&nbsp;Luther first began to preach. His appeal to the Scriptures&nbsp;against the traditions of the Church encouraged a more active&nbsp;propaganda on the part of Balthasar Hubmaier, Carlstadt,&nbsp;Münzer, Johann Denk (d. 1527) and others, some of whom&nbsp;were well-trained scholars capable of maintaining with vigour&nbsp;and effect their ideas of an apostolic fife as the high road to&nbsp;salvation. Münzer dreamed of an approaching millennium on&nbsp;earth to be heralded by violence and suffering, but Hubmaier&nbsp;and Denk were peaceful evangelists who believed that man’s&nbsp;will was free and that each had within him an inner light which&nbsp;would, if he but followed it, guide him to God. To them&nbsp;persecution was an outrage upon Jesus’s teachings. Luther&nbsp;and his sympathizers were blind to the reasonableness of the&nbsp;fundamental teachings of these “ brethren.” The idea of&nbsp;adult baptism, which had after 1525 become generally accepted&nbsp;among them, roused a bitterness which it is rather hard to&nbsp;understand nowadays. But it is easy to see that informal&nbsp;preaching to the people at large, especially after the Peasant&nbsp;Revolt, with which Münzer had been identified, should have&nbsp;led to a general condemnation, under the name “ Anabaptist ”&nbsp;or “ Catabaptist,” of the heterogeneous dissenters who agreed&nbsp;in rejecting the State religion and associated a condemnation&nbsp;of infant baptism with schemes for social betterment. The&nbsp;terrible events in Münster, which was controlled for a short&nbsp;time (1533-34) by a group of Anabaptists under the leadership&nbsp;of John of Leiden, the introduction of polygamy (which appears&nbsp;to have been a peculiar accident rather than a general principle),&nbsp;the speedy capture of the town by an affiance of Catholic and&nbsp;Protestant princes, and the ruthless retribution inflicted by&nbsp;the victors, have been cherished by ecclesiastical writers as&nbsp;a choice and convincing instance of the natural fruits of a&nbsp;rejection of infant baptism. Much truer than the common&nbsp;estimate of the character of the Anabaptists is that given in&nbsp;Sebastian Franck’s Chronicle: “ They taught nothing but love,&nbsp;faith and the crucifixion of the flesh, manifesting patience&nbsp;and humility under many sufferings, breaking bread with one&nbsp;another in sign of unity and love, helping one another with&nbsp;true helpfulness, lending, borrowing, giving, learning to have&nbsp;all things in common, calling each other 'brother.’ ” Menno Simons (b. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">circ.</span><span class="font0"> 1500) succeeded in bringing the scattered Anabaptist&nbsp; communities into a species of association; he discouraged&nbsp; the earlier apocalyptic hopes, inculcated non-resistance&nbsp;, denounced the evils of State control over religious matters,&nbsp;and emphasized personal conversion, and adult baptism as its&nbsp;appropriate seal. The English Independents and the modern&nbsp;Baptists, as well as the Mennonites, may be regarded as the&nbsp;historical continuation of lines of development going back&nbsp;to the Waldensians and the Bohemian Brethren, and passing&nbsp;down through the German, Dutch and Swiss Anabaptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The modern scholar as he reviews the period of the Protestant Revolt looks naturally, but generally in vain, for those rationalistic tendencies which become so clear in the&nbsp;latter part of the 17th century. Luther found no intellectual difficulties in his acceptance and interpretation of the Scriptures as God’s word, and in maintaining against the Anabaptists the legitimacy of every old custom&nbsp;that was not obviously contrary to the Scriptures. Indeed,&nbsp;he gloried in the inherent and divine unreasonableness of&nbsp;Christianity, and brutally denounced reason as a cunning fool,&nbsp;“ a pretty harlot.” The number of questions which Calvin&nbsp;failed to ask or eluded by absolutely irrational expedients frees&nbsp;him from any taint of modern rationalism. But in Servetus,&nbsp;whose execution he approved, we find an isolated, feeble revolt&nbsp;against assumptions which both Catholics and Protestants of&nbsp;all shades accepted without question. It is pretty clear that&nbsp;the common accounts of the Renaissance and of the revival of&nbsp;learning grossly exaggerate the influence of the writers of&nbsp;Greece and Rome, for they produced no obvious rationalistic&nbsp;movement, as would have been the case had Plato and Cicero,&nbsp;Lucretius and Lucian, been taken really seriously. Neo-Platonism, which is in some respects nearer the Christian&nbsp;patristic than the Hellenic spirit, was as far as the radical&nbsp;religious thinkers of the Italian Renaissance receded. The&nbsp;only religious movement that can be regarded as even rather&nbsp;vaguely the outcome of humanism is the Socinian. Faustus&nbsp;Sozzini, a native of Sienna (1539-1603), much influenced by&nbsp;his uncle Lelio Sozzini, after a wandering, questioning life,&nbsp;found his way to Poland, where he succeeded in uniting the&nbsp;various Anabaptist sects into a species of church, the doctrines&nbsp;of which are set forth in the Confession of Rakow (near Minsk),&nbsp;published in Polish in 1605 and speedily in German and Latin.&nbsp;The Latin edition declares that although this new statement of&nbsp;the elements of the Christian faith differs from the articles of&nbsp;other Christian creeds it is not to be mistaken for a challenge.&nbsp;It does not aim at binding the opinions of men or at condemning&nbsp; to the tortures of hell-fire those who refuse to accept it.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Absit a nobis ea mens, immo amentia.</span><span class="font0"> “ We have, it is true,&nbsp;ventured to prepare a catechism, but we force it on no one;&nbsp;we express our opinions, but we coerce no one. It is free to&nbsp;every one to form his own conclusions in religious matters;&nbsp;and so we do no more than set forth the meaning of divine&nbsp;things as they appear to our minds without, however, attacking&nbsp;or insulting those who differ from us. This is the golden&nbsp;freedom of preaching which the holy words of the New Testament so strictly enjoin upon us. . . . Who art thou, miserable&nbsp;man, who would smother and extinguish in others the fire of&nbsp;God’s Spirit which it has pleased him to kindle in them ? ”&nbsp;The Socinian creed sprang from intellectual rather than religious motives. Sufficient reasons could be assigned for&nbsp;accepting the New Testament as God’s word and Christ as the&nbsp;Christian’s guide. He was not God, but a divine prophet born&nbsp;of a virgin and raised on the third day as the first-fruits of&nbsp;them that slept. From the standpoint of the history of enlightenment, as Harnack has observed, “ Socinianism with its systematic&nbsp; criticism (tentative and imperfect as it may now seem)&nbsp;and its rejection of all the assumptions based upon mere&nbsp;ecclesiastical tradition, can scarcely be rated too highly. That&nbsp;modern Unitarianism is all to be traced back to Sozzini and&nbsp;the Rakow Confession need not be assumed. The anti-Trinitarian path was one which opened invitingly before a considerable class of critical minds, seeming as it did to lead out into</span></p>
