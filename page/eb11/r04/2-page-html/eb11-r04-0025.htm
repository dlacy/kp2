<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Obligations.—</span><span class="font0">In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Aureorum</span><span class="font0"> Gaius says obligations arise from either contract or delict, or miscellaneous&nbsp;causes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(variae causarum figurae).</span><span class="font0"> But those arising&nbsp;from contract fill a place in the later jurisprudence&nbsp;vastly greater than those arising from delict. In the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">XII. Tables it was different. In them delicts were much more prominent than contracts—wrongs entitling the sufferer to&nbsp;demand the imposition of penalties upon the wrong-doer that&nbsp;in most cases covered both reparation and punishment. The&nbsp;disproportion in the formulated provisions in reference to the&nbsp;two sources of obligation, however, is not surprising. For,&nbsp;first of all, the purpose of the decemviral code was to remove&nbsp;uncertainties and leave as little as possible to the arbitrariness&nbsp;of the magistrates. In nothing was there more scope for this&nbsp;than in the imposition of penalties; and, as different offences&nbsp;required to be differently treated, the provisions in reference&nbsp;to them were necessarily multiplied. In the next place, the&nbsp;intercourse that evokes contract was as yet very limited. Agriculture was the occupation of the great majority; of trade&nbsp;and commerce there was little; coined money had hardly&nbsp;begun to be used as a circulating medium. Lastly, the safeguards of engagement then lay to a great extent in the sworn&nbsp;oath or the plighted faith, of which the law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jus)</span><span class="font0"> hardly yet&nbsp;took cognisance, but which found a protection quite as potent&nbsp;in the religious and moral sentiments that had so firm a hold&nbsp;on the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be asked—If a man purchased sheep or store cattle, a plough, a toga, a jar of wine or oil, had he no action to compel&nbsp;delivery, the vendor no action for payment of the price?&nbsp;Did the hire of a horse or the loan of a bullock create no&nbsp;obligation? Was partnership unknown, and deposit,&nbsp;and pledge, and suretyship in any other form than that&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vadimoniumt</span><span class="font0"> One can have no hesitation in answering that,&nbsp;as transactions of daily life, they must all have been more or less&nbsp;familiar. It does not follow, however, that they were already regulated by law and protected by the ordinary tribunals. Modern&nbsp;historical jurists are pretty well agreed that not only the real contracts of loan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{mutuum</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">commodatum),</span><span class="font0"> deposit, and pledge, but&nbsp;also the consensual ones of sale, location, partnership, and mandate,&nbsp;and the verbal one of suretyship, were as yet barely recognized by&nbsp;law. The law recognized conveyance but hardly contract. Sale&nbsp;was the offspring of barter—of instant exchange of one thing for&nbsp;another. With such instant exchange there was no room for obligation to deliver on either side. The substitution of coined money&nbsp;for the raw metal can hardly have effected any radical change:&nbsp;the ordinary practice of those early times must still have been&nbsp;ready-money transaction—an instant exchange of ware for price;&nbsp;and it can only have been when, for some reason or other, the&nbsp;arrangement was exceptionally for delivery or payment at a future&nbsp;date, say next market day, that obligation was held to have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">created. Was that obligation enforceable by the civil tribunals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• Some jurists hold that it was—that at no time were the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium </span><span class="font0">contracts outside the protection of judicial remedies, although by&nbsp;a simpler procedure than that resorted to for enforcement of the&nbsp;contracts of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span><span class="font0"> But two provisions in the XII. Tables&nbsp;seem to prove that it was not so enforceable when they were, drawn&nbsp;up. The first is that already referred to as recorded by Justinian—&nbsp;that, where a thing was sold and delivered, the property, nevertheless, was not to pass until the price had been paid or sureties </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(vades)</span><span class="font0"> for&nbsp;it accepted by the vendor. Far from being a recognition of the obligatory nature of the transaction, this provision is really a recognition&nbsp;of the inability of the law to enforce payment of the price by the&nbsp;vendee; it is a declaration that, on the latter’s failure to pay, the&nbsp;vendor, unprotected by any personal action, should be entitled to&nbsp;get back the thing sold as still his own, no matter in whose hands he&nbsp;found it. The second related to the case ot a person who had&nbsp;bought a victim for sacrifice, but had failed to pay for it. A real&nbsp;action for its revindication by the seller after it had been consumed on&nbsp;the altar was out of the question; so he was authorized by the Tables,&nbsp;by the process of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pignoris capio,</span><span class="font0"> at his own hand to appropriate in&nbsp;satisfaction a sufficient equivalent out of the. belongings of the&nbsp;purchaser, against whom he had no personal action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was a principle of the law of Rome through the whole of its history, though in course of time subject to an increasing&nbsp;number of exceptions, that mere agreement between&nbsp;two persons did not give him in whose favour it was&nbsp;conceived a right to demand its enforcement. To&nbsp;entitle a man to claim the intervention of the civil&nbsp;tribunals to compel implement of an engagement undertaken&nbsp;by another, it was necessary (subject to those exceptions)&nbsp;either that it should be clothed in some form prescribed or&nbsp;recognized by the law, or that it should be accompanied or&nbsp;followed by some relative act which rendered it something&nbsp;more than a mere interchange of consent. Under the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables the formalities required to elevate&nbsp;an agreement to the rank of contract and make it civilly obligatory sometimes combined ceremonial act and words of style,&nbsp;sometimes did not go beyond words of style, but in all cases&nbsp;took place before witnesses. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dotis dictio,</span><span class="font0"> the undertaking of&nbsp;a. parent to provide a dowry with his daughter whom he was&nbsp;giving in marriage, and txjd/mozrittw, the guarantee of a surety&nbsp;for the due fulfilment of the undertaking either of a party to&nbsp;a contract or a party to a litigation (some think only the latter),&nbsp;probably required nothing more than words of style before&nbsp;persons who could if necessary bear witness to them; whereas&nbsp;an engagement incident to a mancipation, or an undertaking&nbsp;to repay borrowed money, required in addition a ceremony&nbsp;with the copper and the scales. This undertaking to repay&nbsp;arose from the contract of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexum,</span><span class="font0"> which was, it is thought,&nbsp;older than the Tables; both it and the verbal contract by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sponsio or</span><span class="font0"> stipulation, which was younger, require here further&nbsp;consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nexal Contract<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font0">The tumults and seditions so frequent in Rome during the first two centuries of the Republic are&nbsp;as frequently attributed by ancient writers to the&nbsp;abuses of the law of debt as to any other cause, social&nbsp;or political. The circumstances of the poorer plebeians were such as to make it almost impossible to&nbsp;avoid borrowing. Their scanty means were dependent on the&nbsp;regular cultivation of their little acres, and on each operation&nbsp;of the agricultural year being performed in proper rotation&nbsp;and at the proper season. But this was every now and again&nbsp;interfered with by wars which detained them from home at&nbsp;seed-time or harvest, practically rendering their farms unproductive, and leaving them and their families in straits for the&nbsp;commonest necessaries of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The practice of lending </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per libram</span><span class="font0"> was doubtless of great antiquity—indeed, the intervention of the scales was a necessity&nbsp;when money or what passed for it had to be weighed&nbsp;instead of counted; and not improbably old custom&nbsp;conceded to a lender who had thus made an advance&nbsp;in the presence of witnesses some very summary and stringent&nbsp;remedy against a borrower who failed in repayment. How, after&nbsp;the Servian reforms, it was subjected to much the same formalities&nbsp;as were required for mancipation has been shown already. With&nbsp;the introduction of a coinage the transaction, instead of being&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per libram</span><span class="font0"> simply, became one </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram}</span><span class="font0"> the scales were&nbsp;touched with a single piece, representing the money which had&nbsp;already been or was about to be paid, a formula recited whereby&nbsp;the obligation of repayment was imposed on the borrower, and&nbsp;an appeal made to the witnesses for their testimony. Unfortunately this formula is nowhere preserved. Huschke assuming&nbsp;that the lender was the only speaker, formulates it thus—&nbsp;<sup>u</sup> quod ego tibi mille libras hoc aere aeneaque libra nexas dedi,&nbsp;eas tu mihi post annum jure nexi dare damnas esto ”—<sup>a</sup> whereas&nbsp;with this coin and these copper scales I have given thee a&nbsp;thousand </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">asses,</span><span class="font0"> be thou therefore bound </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jure nexi</span><span class="font0"> to repay&nbsp;them to me a year hence.” The phrase </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">damnas esto,</span><span class="font0"> like the&nbsp;rest of the formula, is unsupported by any conclusive authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The modem literature on the subject of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span class="font0"> is very large and the views taken of it are discordant. The fundamental work&nbsp;is that of Huschke, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Über d. Recht des Nexum</span><span class="font0"> (Leipzig, 1846). Danz&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Gesch. d. röm.
