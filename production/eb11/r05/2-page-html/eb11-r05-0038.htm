<p><span class="font0">ROYALTY (O. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">realte, reialte, royaultê,</span><span class="font0"> from Med. Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regalitas,</span><span class="font0"> the substantive of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regalis, of or</span><span class="font0"> belonging to a king,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rex),</span><span class="font0"> kingly state or personality, hence a royal person, or number&nbsp;of persons of royal birth collectively, a member of a royal family.&nbsp;More particularly “ royalty ” is used of the rights and attributes&nbsp;of a sovereign, and especially of dues paid to the crown, which&nbsp;belong to the sovereign </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jure coronae,</span><span class="font0"> such as dues from gold&nbsp;and silver mines, waifs, estrays, &amp;c. The term is usually&nbsp;applied to the payment made by a publisher to an author on&nbsp;every copy of his book sold; to the payment made to a patentee&nbsp;on each article manufactured under his patent by a licensee&nbsp;(see Patents), and to the payment made to the owner of&nbsp;minerals for the right of working, paid on the ton or other&nbsp;weight raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROY AN, a town of W. France, in the department of Charente Inférieure, on the right bank of the Gironde, at its mouth&nbsp;63 m. below and N.N.W. of Bordeaux. Pop. (1906) 7142.&nbsp;Royan is one of the most frequented bathing resorts on the&nbsp;Atlantic seaboard. The coast is divided into a number of&nbsp;small bays or “ conches,” forming so many distinct beaches:&nbsp;to the E. of the town is the “ Grande Conche ” with the municipal&nbsp;casino; to the S. the “ Conche de Foncillon,” separated from&nbsp;the first-named by a quay which forms a fine terraced esplanade;&nbsp;beyond the fort of Royan follow in succession the conches&nbsp;“ du Chay ” and “ de Robinson,” and the most fashionable&nbsp;of all, that of Pontaillac. The port carries on sardine-fishing&nbsp;and an active coasting trade, but the harbour at high tide&nbsp;is accessible only to vessels drawing from 8 to 10 ft., and at&nbsp;low water is dry. Eugène Pelletan, the author, has a statue&nbsp;in the town, of which he was a benefactor. The lighthouse of&nbsp;Cordouan, 200 ft. in height, rebuilt on the site of an older&nbsp;tower by the architect Louis de Foix in 1584-1610 and added&nbsp;to about the end of the 18th century, stands on a rock&nbsp;7 j m. W.S.W. of Royan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Royan after passing through many hands came to the family of la Trémoille, in whose favour it was made first a marquisate&nbsp;and then a duchy. During the first half of the 15th century&nbsp;it was held by the English. During the wars of religion it&nbsp;was a centre of Calvinism and had to sustain in 1622 an&nbsp;eight days’ siege by the troops of Louis XIII. As late as the&nbsp;end of the 18th century it was but a “ bourg ” of about one&nbsp;thousand inhabitants, noticeable only for its priory, where&nbsp;Brantôme wrote a portion of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicles.</span><span class="font0"> The prosperity&nbsp;of the place dates from the Restoration, when steamboat communication was established with Bordeaux.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYAT, a watering-place of central France, in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, situated at a height of 1475 ft. on the Tire-taine, if m. S.W. of Clermont-Ferrand. Pop. (1906) 1451.&nbsp;The thermal springs, situated in the part of Royat known as&nbsp;St Mart, are strongly impregnated with carbonic acid and&nbsp;chloride of sodium and are'used in cases of rheumatism, gout,&nbsp;bronchitis, asthma, anaemia, &amp;c. They were known in Roman&nbsp;times, and ruins of ancient baths are still to be seen. The&nbsp;village of Royat proper, a little higher up the valley, has a&nbsp;church of the nth and 12th centuries fortified with battlements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYER-COLLARD, PIERRE PAUL (1763-1845), French statesman and philosopher, was born on the 21st of June 1763&nbsp;at Sompuis, near Vitry le Français (Marne), the son of Antoine&nbsp;Royer, a small proprietor. His mother, Angélique Perpétue&nbsp;Collard, was a woman of unusual strength of character and of&nbsp;austere piety. Pierre Paul Royer was sent at twelve to the&nbsp;college of Chaumont of which his uncle, Father Paul Collard,&nbsp;was director. He subsequently followed his uncle to Saint-Omer, where he studied mathematics. At the outbreak of&nbsp;the Revolution, which moved him to passionate sympathy,&nbsp;he was practising at the Parisian bar. He was returned by&nbsp;his section, the Island of Saint Louis, to the Commune, of which&nbsp;he was secretary from 1790 to 1792. After the revolution&nbsp;of the 10th of August in that year he was replaced by J. L.&nbsp;Tallien. His sympathies were now with the Gironde, and&nbsp;after the insurrection of the 12th Prairial (31st of May 1793)&nbsp;he was in danger of his life. He returned to Sompuis, and&nbsp;was saved from arrest possihly by the protection of Danton&nbsp;and in some degree by the impression made by his mother’s&nbsp;courageous piety on the local commissary of the Convention.&nbsp;In 1797 he was returned by his department (Marne) to the&nbsp;Council of the Five Hundred, where he allied himself especially&nbsp;with Camille Jordan. He made one great speech in the council&nbsp;in defence of the principles of religious liberty, but the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup&nbsp;d'état</span><span class="font0"> of Fructidor (4th of September 1797) drove him again&nbsp;into private life. It was at this period that he developed&nbsp;his legitimist opinions and entered into communication with&nbsp;the' comte de Provence (Louis XVIII.). He was the ruling&nbsp;spirit in the small committee formed in Paris to help forward&nbsp;a Restoration independent of the comte d’Artois and his party;&nbsp;but with the establishment of the Consulate he saw the prospects&nbsp;of the monarchy were temporarily hopeless, and the members&nbsp;of the committee resigned. From that time until the Restoration Royer-Collard devoted himself exclusively to the study of&nbsp;philosophy. He derived his opposition to the philosophy of&nbsp;Condillac chiefly from the study of Descartes and his followers,&nbsp;and from his early veneration for the fathers of Port-Royal.&nbsp;He was occupied with the erection of a system which should&nbsp;provide a moral and political education consonant with his&nbsp;view of the needs of France. From 1811 to 1814 he lectured&nbsp;at the Sorbonne. From this time dates his long association&nbsp;with Guizot. Royer-Collard himself was supervisor of the&nbsp;press under the first restoration. From 1815 onwards he sat&nbsp;as deputy for Marne in the chamber. ‘As president of the&nbsp;commission of public instruction from 1815 to 1820 he checked&nbsp;the pretensions of the clerical party, the immediate cause of&nbsp;his retirement being an attempt to infringe the rights of the&nbsp;university of Paris by giving university diplomas, independent&nbsp;of university examinations, to the teaching fraternity of the&nbsp;Christian Brothers. Royer-Collard’s acceptance of the Legitimist principle did not prevent a faithful adhesion to the social&nbsp;revolution effected in 1789, and he protested in 1815, in 1820,&nbsp;and again under the monarchy of July against laws of exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was the moving spirit of the &quot; Doctrinaires,” as they were called, who met at the house of the comte de Ste Aulaire&nbsp;and in the salon of Madame de Staël’s daughter, the duchesse&nbsp;de Broglie. The leaders of the party, beside Royer-Collard,&nbsp;were Guizot, P. F. H. de Serre, Camille Jordan and Charles de&nbsp;Rémusat. In 1820 he was excluded from the council of state&nbsp;by a decree signed by his former ally Serre. In 1827 he was&nbsp;elected for seven constituencies, but remained faithful to his&nbsp;native department. Next year he became president of the&nbsp;chamber, and fought against the reactionary policy which&nbsp;precipitated the Revolution of July. It was Royer-Collard&nbsp;who in March 1830 presented the address of the 221. From&nbsp;that time he took no active part in politics, although he retained&nbsp;his seat in the chamber until 1839. He died at his estate of&nbsp;Château vieux, near Vitry, on the 2nd of September 1845. He&nbsp;had been a member of the Academy since 1827. Royer-Collard&nbsp;married in 1799 Mlle, de Forges de Châteauvieux. The two&nbsp;daughters who survived to womanhood received an education&nbsp;of the utmost austerity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Royer-Collard left no considerable writings, but fragments of his philosophical work are included in Jouffroy’s translation of the&nbsp;works, of Thomas Reid. The standard life of Royer-Collard is bv&nbsp;his friend Prosper de Barante, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vie politique de M. Royer Collard,&nbsp;ses discours et ses écrits</span><span class="font0"> (2 vols., 1861). There are also biographies&nbsp;by M. A. Philippe (1857), by L. Vingtain (1858), by E.
