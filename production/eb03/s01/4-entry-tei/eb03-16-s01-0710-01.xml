or CHIO, a celebrated iſland of the Archipelago (fee <hi rend="smallcaps">Chio).</hi> It is 32 miles long and 15 broad, is a mountainous but very pleaſant country. The principal mountain, called anciently <hi rend="italic">Pelinaeus,</hi> preſents to view a long lofty range of bare rock, reflecting the fun; but the receſſes at its feet are diligently cultivated, and reward the huſbandman by their rich produce. The ſlopes are clothed with vines. The groves of lemon, orange, and citron-trees, regularly planted, at once perfume the air with the odour of their bloſſoms, and delight the eye with their golden fruit. Myrtles and jaſmines are interſperſed, with olive and palm-trees, and cypreffes. Amid theſe the tall minarees riſe, and white houſes glitter, dazzling the beholder. The inhabitants export a large quantity of pleaſant wine to the neighbouring iſlands, but their principal trade is in ſilks. They have alſo a ſmall commerce in wool <hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> cheeſe, figs, and maſtic. The women are better bred than in other parts of the Levant; and though the dreſs is odd, yet it is very neat. The partridges are tame, being ſent every day into the fields to get their Sving, and in the evening are called back with a whiſtle. The town called <hi rend="italic">Scio</hi> is large, pleaſant, and the beſt built of any in the Levant, the houſes being beautiful and commodious, ſome of which are terraffed, and others covered with tiles. The ſtreets are paved with flint-ſtones; and the Venetians, while they had it in their poſſeſſion, made a great many alterations for the better. The caſtle is an old citadel built by the Genoeſe, in which the Turks have a garrifon of 1400 men. The harbour of Scio is the rendezvous of all ſhipping that goes to or comes from Conſtantinople, and will hold a fleet of fourſcore veſſels. They reckon there are 10,000 Turks, 100,000 Greeks, and 10,000 Latins, on this iſland. The Turks took it from the Venetians in 1695. Scio is a biſhop’s ſee, and is ſeated on the ſea-ſide, 47 miles weſt of Smyrna, and 210 ſouth-weſt of Conſtantinople.</p><p>There are but few remains of antiquity in this place. “The moſt curious of them (ſays Dr Chandler) is that which has been named without reaſon the <hi rend="italic">School of Homer.</hi> It is on the coaſt at ſome diſtance from the city northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The ſhape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddeſs, the head and an arm wanting. She is repreſented, as uſual, fitting. The chair has a lion carved on each ſide, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim or ſeat, and about five yards over, The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indiſtinct, and probable of the moſt remote antiquity. From the Hope higher up is a fine view of the rich vale of Scio, and of the channel, with its ſhining iſlands, beyond which are the mountains on the mainland of Alia. ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
