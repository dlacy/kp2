<p><span class="font1">conquests in Livonia ; and the attempt to open up a passage for Russia into the Baltic failed till carried out by&nbsp;the efforts of Peter the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the chief events of this reign was the conquest of Siberia by a Cossack named Yermak, who had formerly&nbsp;been a robber, but was pardoned by the czar on laying his&nbsp;conquests at the imperial feet. Among many points in which&nbsp;Ivan resembled Henry VIII. was the number of his wives.&nbsp;On the death of the seventh, he was anxious to procure&nbsp;an eighth from the court of his friend Elizabeth of England, and the daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon was&nbsp;offered to the inspection of the Russian ambassador,&nbsp;Feodor Pisemski, at her own desire and the queen’s.&nbsp;She was presented to him in the gardens of York House.&nbsp;The ambassador prostrated himself before her, and professed to be dazzled by her beauty. Before, however, the&nbsp;negotiations for the marriage were concluded, the young&nbsp;lady, of whom a very favourable account had been transmitted to the court of Moscow, became alarmed. Rumours&nbsp;had reached her about the former wives of the czar and&nbsp;his habits. She therefore declined the brilliant prospect&nbsp;of an alliance associated with so many dangers. Full&nbsp;details of the adventures of the Englishmen who resided at&nbsp;Ivan’s court will be found in Hakluyt’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages.</span><span class="font1"> In 1567&nbsp;Anthony Jenkinson was commissioned by the czar to&nbsp;convey a special message to Queen Elizabeth, “ that the&nbsp;Queen’s Majestie and he might be to all their enemyes&nbsp;joyned as one, and that England and Russland might be&nbsp;in all manners as one.” In fact Ivan wanted the assistance&nbsp;of the English in his wars against the Swedes and the&nbsp;Poles ; he could appreciate the superiority of their weapons&nbsp;and military tactics ; but Elizabeth only cared to secure a&nbsp;monopoly of trade, which the English for a long time&nbsp;enjoyed, and, according to the historian Ustrialoff, the&nbsp;Russians were but little benefited by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The declining days of Ivan were embittered by the death of his eldest son, whom he had stricken in a fit of passion&nbsp;with his iron staff. When the paroxysm of his anger was&nbsp;over, his grief was boundless. Full of remorse and&nbsp;continually afraid of conspiracies which might be concocted&nbsp;by his subjects, and harassed by superstitious dread, in&nbsp;which he betook himself to the divination of witches, @@<sup>1</sup> he&nbsp;expired in the year 1584.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ivan was succeeded by his eldest surviving son Feodor (Theodore), at that time twenty-seven years of age. He&nbsp;was feeble both in mind and body, and very superstitious.&nbsp;Fletcher calls him “ very simple, and almost a natural,”&nbsp;and Solomon Henning, author of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle of Livonia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">says that he was so weak-minded that he could find no&nbsp;greater amusement than tolling the church bells before&nbsp;service. In consequence, the chief power in the empire&nbsp;fell into the hands of Boris Godunoff, @@<sup>2</sup> the brother-in-law&nbsp;of Feodor, a man of boundless ambition and great&nbsp;capacity. His inordinate lust of rule he concealed under&nbsp;the guise of piety ; his commanding presence extorted&nbsp;respect wherever he went. Between him and the throne&nbsp;were only the sickly Feodor and his brother Dmitri,&nbsp;still a child, who had been previously removed to the&nbsp;town of Uglich in the government of Yaroslavl. For a&nbsp;while Boris had nourished the idea of proclaiming Dmitri&nbsp;illegitimate, on the ground that he was the son of Ivan’s&nbsp;seventh wife, a marriage forbidden by the canons of the&nbsp;church. Finally, as there seems every reason to believe,&nbsp;he caused the child to be assassinated at Uglich on the&nbsp;15th of May 1591. The circumstances of the death of the&nbsp;young prince are involved in mystery ; so much, however,&nbsp;is certain. Dmitri was playing in a court-yard; his gover</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">ness Vasilissa Volokhova, his nurse, and a servant-maid were in attendance. Whether from accident or design&nbsp;they all for a time lost sight of him. According to their&nbsp;testimony while under examination, the young prince had a&nbsp;knife in his hand when last seen ; he amused himself with&nbsp;sticking it into the ground and cutting pieces of wood.&nbsp;Suddenly the nurse, on looking round, saw him prostrate&nbsp;and covered with blood. He died almost immediately&nbsp;from a large wound in his throat. The account of how&nbsp;the news was brought to Moscow is described in a highly&nbsp;dramatic manner by Horsey. @@<sup>3</sup> We have no direct evidence of the complicity of Godunoff in this murder ; but&nbsp;there seems little doubt of it. A secret inquiry was conducted; the body, however, was not examined, and the&nbsp;commissioners reported that Dmitri had died of a wound&nbsp;accidentally inflicted by himself in a fit of epilepsy. On&nbsp;account of the riot which had taken place at Uglich,&nbsp;Boris proceeded to punish the town. More than two&nbsp;hundred of the inhabitants were put to death and many&nbsp;sent to Siberia. The church bell of Uglich was banished&nbsp;with them and placed in the capital of Siberia ; it was not&nbsp;brought back till the earlier part of the present century.&nbsp;The remains of Dmitri, who was afterwards canonized,&nbsp;were deposited in the cathedral of St Michael, the burial-place of the czars. Soon afterwards a great fire broke out&nbsp;in Moscow, and Boris caused many streets to be rebuilt at&nbsp;his own expense, distributed aid, and exempted the sufferers&nbsp;from taxes; but still the people murmured secretly; they&nbsp;felt that the stain of blood was upon him, and ungratefully&nbsp;accused him of having caused the city to be set on fire.&nbsp;In the same year (1591) the khan of the Crimea made one&nbsp;of his periodical raids against Moscow. He set out from&nbsp;Perekop, and marched in a straight line, everywhere plundering and devastating. In these circumstances, Feodor&nbsp;displayed nothing but imbecility. He merely remarked&nbsp;that the saints who protected Russia would fight for her,&nbsp;and again betook himself to his favourite amusement of&nbsp;bell-ringing. Boris, however, showed vigour. In a few&nbsp;days he caused Moscow to be surrounded with palisades,&nbsp;redoubts, and artillery. The Mongols were repulsed with&nbsp;great slaughter; but, although Boris saved his country, he&nbsp;could not secure the goodwill of the people. Indeed, they&nbsp;accused him of having invited the Mongols that the general&nbsp;danger might make them forget the death of Dmitri.&nbsp;The czarina, Irene, wife of Feodor and sister of Boris,&nbsp;about this time gave birth to a female child, which lived&nbsp;but a few days, and Boris was of course accused of having&nbsp;poisoned it. In reality the princess suffered from continual&nbsp;ill-health, and on one occasion we find Elizabeth of&nbsp;England sending her a physician. Boris, however, still&nbsp;persevered in his energetic measures for strengthening the&nbsp;empire. Smolensk was fortified, Archangel built ; and a&nbsp;strong cordon was drawn round the territories occupied by&nbsp;the Mongols. The Swedes were driven into Narva, and diplomatic relations were opened with the European powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About this time the imbecile Feodor died, and with him became extinct the dynasty of Scandinavian Rurik.&nbsp;This event occurred in 1598, and Boris was elected to&nbsp;succeed him. Godunoff, however, who felt sure of the&nbsp;crown, at first affected to be unwilling to receive it. He&nbsp;retired to a monastery and was followed by the people,&nbsp;supplicating him to be their emperor. He kept Russia in&nbsp;this state of suspense for six weeks, and then relented. As&nbsp;soon as he ascended the throne, the traces of his vigorous&nbsp;hand could be found everywhere. One of his first plans&nbsp;was the abridgment of the power of the nobility, which&nbsp;had been begun by Ivan III. and continued by Ivan IV.&nbsp;By this a benefit was conferred upon Russia; but Boris also&nbsp;served his own ambition. He was particularly severe to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
