<p><span class="font0">perplexing. Apparently the majority of those specially mentioned in the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges regiac</span><span class="font0"> and other records of the regal period&nbsp;were regarded as violations of divine law, and the punishments&nbsp;appropriate to them determined upon that footing. Yet in many&nbsp;of them the prosecution was left to the state or to private individuals. It is not clear, indeed, that there was any machinery for&nbsp;public prosecution except in treason and murder,—the former because it was essentially a state offence, the latter because it was&nbsp;comparatively early deemed expedient to repress the blood-feud,&nbsp;which was apt to lead to deplorable results when friends and&nbsp;neighbours appeared to defend the alleged assassin.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Take some of those offences whose sanction was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saeratio capitis. </span><span class="font0">Breach of duty resulting from the fiduciary relation between patron&nbsp;and client, maltreatment of a parent by his child, exposure or killing of a child by its father contrary to the Romulian rules, the&nbsp;ploughing up or removal of a boundary stone, the slaughter of a&nbsp;plough-ox,—all these were capital olfences ; the offender, by the&nbsp;formula </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saeer esto,</span><span class="font0"> was devoted to the infernal gods. Festus says&nbsp;that, although the rules of divine law did not allow that he should&nbsp;be offered as a sacrifice to the deity he had especially offended </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(nee&nbsp;fias est eum immolari),</span><span class="font0"> yet he was so utterly beyond the pale of the&nbsp;law and its protection that any one might kill him with impunity.&nbsp;But, as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saeratio</span><span class="font0"> was usually coupled with forfeiture of the&nbsp;offender’s estate or part of it to religious uses, it is probable that&nbsp;steps were taken to have the outlawry or excommunication judicially declared, though whether by the pontiffs, the king, or the&nbsp;curies does not appear ; such a declaration would, besides, relieve&nbsp;the private avenger of the incensed god of the chance of future&nbsp;question as to whether or not the citizen he had slain was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saeer</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the eye of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That there must have been other wrongful acts that were regarded in early Rome as deserving of punishment or penalty of some sort,&nbsp;besides those visited with death, sacration, or forfeiture of estate,&nbsp;total or partial, cannot be doubted ; no community has ever been&nbsp;so happy as to know nothing of thefts, robberies, and assaults.&nbsp;The XII. Tables contained numerous provisions in reference to&nbsp;them ; but it is extremely probable that, down at least to the time&nbsp;of Servius Tullius, the manner of dealing with them rested on&nbsp;custom, and was in the main self-redress, restrained by the intervention of the king when it appeared to him that the injured party&nbsp;was going beyond the bounds of fair reprisal, and frequently bought&nbsp;off with a composition. When the offence was strictly within the&nbsp;family, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font0"> and perhaps the guild, it was for those who&nbsp;exercised jurisdiction over those corporations to judge of the wrong&nbsp;and prescribe and enforce the penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Effect of the Servian Reforms on the Private Law.—</span><span class="font1">The aim of the constitutional, military, and financial reforms&nbsp;of Servius Tullius was to promote an advance towards&nbsp;equality between patricians and plebeians. While it may&nbsp;be an open question whether the institution of the comitia&nbsp;of the centuries was of his doing, or only a result of his&nbsp;arrangements in after years, it seems clear that he had&nbsp;it in view to admit the plebeians to some at least of the&nbsp;privileges of citizenship, imposing on them at the same&nbsp;time a proportionate share of its duties and its burdens.&nbsp;Privileges, duties, and burdens were alike to be measured&nbsp;by the citizen’s position as a freeholder ; the amount of&nbsp;real estate with its appurtenances held by him on quiri-tarian title was to determine the nature of the military&nbsp;service he was to render, the extent to which he was to&nbsp;be liable for tribute, and, assuming Servius to have contemplated the creation of a new assembly, the influence&nbsp;he was to exercise in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To facilitate the execution of his scheme it was necessary to establish a register of the citizens </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(census),</span><span class="font1"> which should contain, in addition to a record of the strength of&nbsp;their families, a statement of the value of their lands and&nbsp;appurtenances, and which should be revised periodically.&nbsp;In order to ensure as far as possible certainty of title, and&nbsp;relieve the officials of troublesome investigations into the&nbsp;genuineness of every alleged change of ownership between&nbsp;two valuations, it was further declared—presumably by&nbsp;Servius—that no alleged transfer would be recognized&nbsp;which had not been effected publicly, with observance of&nbsp;certain prescribed solemnities, or else by surrender in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">court before the supreme magistrate. The form of conveyance thus introduced got the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mancipium,</span><span class="font1"> and at a later period </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mancipatio,</span><span class="font1"> while the lands and other&nbsp;things that were to pass by it came to be known—whether&nbsp;from the first or not is of little moment—as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Hence arose in the law of property a distinction of great&nbsp;importance, only abolished by Justinian more than a&nbsp;thousand years later, between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> which were&nbsp;transferable in quiritarian right only by mancipation or&nbsp;surrender in court, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nee mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> which were transferable by simple delivery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mancipation is described by Gaius, but with particular reference to the conveyance of movable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font0"> as a pretended sale in&nbsp;presence of five citizens as witnesses and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens</span><span class="font0"> holding a pair&nbsp;of copper scales. The transferee, with one hand on the thing being&nbsp;transferred, and using certain words of style, declared it his by&nbsp;purchase with an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font0"> (which he held in his other hand) and the&nbsp;scales </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(hoe acre aeneaque libra)</span><span class="font0"> ; and simultaneously he struck the&nbsp;scales with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">as,</span><span class="font0"> which he then handed to the transferrer as&nbsp;figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was an&nbsp;immovable that was being transferred was that the mancipation&nbsp;did not require to be on the spot : the land was simply described&nbsp;by its known name in the valuation roll. Although in the time&nbsp;of Gaius only a fictitious sale—in fact the formal conveyance upon&nbsp;a relative contract—yet it was not always so. Its history is veιy&nbsp;simple. The use of the scales fixes its introduction to a time&nbsp;when coined money was not yet current, but raw copper nevertheless&nbsp;had become a standard of value and in a manner a medium of exchange. That, however, was not in the first days of Rome. Then,&nbsp;and for a long time, values were estimated in cattle or sheep, fines&nbsp;were imposed in them, and the deposits in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio sacra·&nbsp;mento (infra,</span><span class="font0"> p. 681) took the same form. The use of copper as a&nbsp;substitute for them in private transactions was probably derived&nbsp;from Etruria. But, being only raw metal or foreign coins, it could&nbsp;be made available for loans or payments only when weighed in the&nbsp;scales : it passed by -weight, not by tale. There is no reason for&nbsp;supposing that the weighing was a solemnity, that it had any&nbsp;significance beyond its obvious purpose of enabling parties to ascertain that a vendor or borrower was getting the amount of copper&nbsp;for which he had bargained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was this practice of everyday life in private transactions that Servius adopted as the basis of his mancipatory conveyance, engrafting on it one or two new features intended to give it publicity&nbsp;and as it were state sanction, and thus render it more serviceable&nbsp;in the transfer of censuable property. Instead of the parties themselves using the scales, an impartial balance-holder, probably an&nbsp;official, was required to undertake the duty, and five citizens were&nbsp;required to attend as witnesses, who were to be the vouchers to&nbsp;the census officials of the regularity of the procedure. They are&nbsp;generally supposed to have been intended as representatives of the&nbsp;five classes in which Servius had distributed the population, and&nbsp;thus virtually of the state ; and the fact that, when the parties&nbsp;appealed to them for their testimony, they were addressed not as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">testes</span><span class="font0"> but as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quiritxs</span><span class="font0"> lends some colour to this view. Servius is&nbsp;also credited with the introduction of rectangular pieces of copper&nbsp;of different but carefully adjusted weights, stamped by his authority&nbsp;with various devices </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aes signatum),</span><span class="font0"> which are usually supposed&nbsp;to have been intended to take the place of the raw metai </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aes rude)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">formerly in use, and so facilitate the process of weighing ; but&nbsp;there is more reason for thinking they were cast and stamped as&nbsp;standards to be put into one scale, while the raw metal whose&nbsp;weight was to be ascertained was put into the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Instead, therefore, of being a fictitious sale, as Gaius describes it, and as it became after the introduction of coined money early in&nbsp;the 4th century, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mancipium or</span><span class="font0"> mancipation, as regulated by&nbsp;Servius, was an actual completed sale in the strictest sense of the&nbsp;term. What were the precise words of style addressed by the transferee to the transferrer, or what exactly the form of the ceremonial,&nbsp;we know not. But, as attendance during all the time that some&nbsp;thousands of pounds perhaps of copper were being weighed would&nbsp;have been an intolerable burden upon the five citizens convoked&nbsp;to discharge a public duty, it may be surmised that it early became&nbsp;the practice to have the price weighed beforehand, and then to&nbsp;reweigh, or pretend to reweigh, before the witnesses only a single&nbsp;little bit of metal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(rauduseulum),</span><span class="font0"> which the transferee then handed&nbsp;to the transferrer as “ the first pound and the last,” and thus representative of the whole.@@<sup>2</sup> Whatever may have been its form, how-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
