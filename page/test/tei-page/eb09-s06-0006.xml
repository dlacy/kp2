                condition, in cereals, &amp;c., starch is certainly the greatest and foremost of all
                the elements of nutrition (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Dietetics</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nutrition).</hi> In its other industrial relations starch is
                used—(1) directly, as a thickening material in calico printing, for the dressing and
                finishing of many textiles, for laundry purposes, adhesive paste, and powder ; and
                (2) indirectly, for the preparation of dextrin and British gum and starch sugar.
                Maize, wheat, and rice starch are principally employed for the direct applications ;
                and for the dextrin and starch-sugar manufacture potato starch is almost exclusively
                selected.</p>

            <p>In the preparation of starch the object of the manufacturer is to burst the vegetable
                cell walls, to liberate the starch granules, and to free them from the other cell
                contents with which they are associated. When, as in the case of the potato, the
                associated cell contents, &amp;c., are readily separated by solution and levigation
                the manufacture is exceedingly simple. Potato starch is prepared principally by
                carefully washing the potatoes and in a kind of rasping machine reducing them to a
                fine pulp, which is deposited in water as raw starch. The impurities of this
                starch—cellulose, albuminoids, fragments of potato, &amp;c.—are separated by washing
                it in fine sieves, through the meshes of which the pure starch alone passes. The
                sieves are variously formed, some revolving, others moving horizontally or in such
                manner as to keep the material in agitation. The starch is then received in tanks,
                in which it settles, and so separates from the soluble albuminoids and salts of the
                potatoes. The settling of the starch is much retarded by the dissolved albuminoids,
                and to hasten the separation small quantities either of alum or of sulphuric acid
                are employed. Alum coagulates the albumen and to that extent contaminates the
                starch, while the acid acts on the starch itself and is difficult of neutralization.
                After the starch has settled, the brown-coloured supernatant liquor is drawn off and
                the starch again washed either in tanks or in a centrifugal machine. Finally it is
                dried by spreading it in layers over porous bricks (a process not required in the
                case of starch washed in a centrifugal machine) and by exposure to the air, after
                which it still retains a large proportion of water, but is in a condition for making
                dextrin or starch-sugar. For further drying it is ground to a rough powder, and
                dried thoroughly in a hot chamber, then reduced to a powder and sifted. A method of
                reducing potatoes to a pulp by slicing and heaping them up till fermentation takes
                place is said to give a large yield of starch, but it is not much practised.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the starches of the cereals, there is greater difficulty, owing to
                the presence of gluten, which with water forms a tough elastic body difficult of
                solution and removal. The difficulty is experienced in greatest measure in dealing
                with wheat, which contains a large proportion of gluten. Wheat starch is separated
                in two different ways—(1) the fermentation method, which is the original process,
                and (2) by mechanical means without preliminary fermentation. In the fermentation
                process whole wheat or wheaten meal is softened and swollen by soaking in water.
                Wheat grains are, in this condition, ground, and the pulp, mixed to a thickish fluid
                with water, is placed in tanks, where it ferments, developing acetic and volatile
                acids which dissolve the gummy constituents of the wheat, with part of the gluten,
                and render the whole less tenacious. After full fermentation, the period of which
                varies with the weather and the process employed, the starch is separated in a
                washing drum. It is subsequently washed with water, which dissolves out the gluten,
                the starch settling in two layers,—one comparatively pure, the other mixed with
                gluten and some branny particles. These layers are separated, the second undergoing
                further washing to remove the gluten, &amp;c., and the remaining operations are
                analogous to those employed in the preparation of potato-starch. By the mechanical
                process wheaten flour is kneaded into a stiff paste, which, after resting for an
                hour or two, is washed over a fine sieve so long as the water passing off continues
                milky, whereby the starch is liberated and the greater part of the gluten retained
                as a gluey elastic mass in the sieve. The starch is subsequently purified by
                fermentation, washing, and treatment in centrifugal machines. The gluten thus
                preserved is a useful food for diabetic patients, and is made with flour into
                artificial macaroni and pastes, besides being valuable for other industrial
                purposes.</p>
            <p>Maize starch is obtained by analogous processes, but, the proportion of gluten in the
                grain being smaller, and less tenacious in its nature, the operations, whether
                chemical or mechanical, present fewer difficulties. Under one method the separation
                of maize starch is facilitated by steeping, swelling, and softening the grain in a
                weak solution of caustic soda, and favourable results are also obtained by a process
                in which the pulp from the crushing mill is treated with water acidulated with
                sulphurous acid.</p>
            <p>In the preparation of rice-starch a weak solution of caustic soda is also employed
                for softening and swelling the grain. It is then washed with pure water, dried,
                ground, and sifted, and again treated with alkaline water, by which the whole of the
                nitrogenous constituents are taken up in soluble form. An acid process for obtaining
                rice-starch is also employed, under which the grain, swollen and ground, is treated
                repeatedly with a solution of hydrochloric acid, which also dissolves away the
                non-starchy constituents of the grain. The laundry starches now in use are
                principally made from rice and from pulse. (J. PA.)</p>
            <p>STAR-CHAMBER, the name given in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries to an English high
                court of justice, consisting of the members of the ordinary council, or of the privy
                council only, with the addition of certain judges, and exercising jurisdiction,
                mainly criminal, in certain cases. The origin and early history of the court are
                somewhat obscure. The Curia Regis of the 12th century, combining judicial,
                deliberative, and administrative functions, had thrown off several offshoots in the
                Court of King’s Bench and other courts, but the crown never parted with the supreme
                jurisdiction whence the subsidiary courts had emanated. When in the 13th century the
                council became a regular and permanent body, practically distinct from the
                parliament of estates, this jurisdiction continued to be exercised by the king in
                council. As the ordinary law- courts became more systematic and important, the
                indefinite character of the conciliar jurisdiction gave rise to frequent complaints
                ; and efforts, for the most part fruitless, were made by the parliaments of the 14th
                century <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in 15 Edw. II. and 2 Edw. III.) to check it.
                The equitable jurisdiction of the chancellor, which grew up during the reign of
                Edward III., flowed from this supreme judicial power, like the common law- courts
                under Henry II, but without drying up the original source. It is in the reign of
                Edward III. that we first hear of the “chancellor, treasurer, justices, and others”
                exercising jurisdiction in the “star-chamber” or “chambre de estoiles” at
                Westminster. In Henry VI.’s reign one Danvers was acquitted of a certain charge by
                the king’s council “ in camera stellata.” Hitherto such Acts of Parliament as had
                recognized this jurisdiction had done so only by way of limitation or prohibition,
                but in 1453, about the time when the distinction between the ordinary and the privy
                council first became apparent, an Act was passed by which the chancellor was
                empowered to enforce the attendance of all persons summoned by the privy seal before
                the king and his council in all cases not determinable by common law. At this time,
                then, the jurisdiction of the council was recognized as supplementary to that of the
                ordinary law-courts. But the anarchy of the Wars of the Roses, and the decay of
                provincial justice owing to the influence of great barons and the turbulence of the
                lower classes, obliged parliament to entrust wider powers to the council. This was
                the object of the famous Act of 3 Hen. VII., which was quoted by the lawyers of the
                Long Parliament as creating the court of star- chamber. This, however, as is shown
                above, it was far from doing. The Act of 3 Hen. VII. empowered a committee of the
                council, consisting of the chancellor, treasurer, privy seal, or any two of them,
                with the chief justices, or in their absence two other justices, a bishop, and a
                temporal lord, to act as a court of justice for enforcing the law in cases where it
                was thwarted by bribery, intimidation, or partiality. The jurisdiction thus
                entrusted to a committee of the council was not, therefore, like that granted in
                1453, supplementary, but superseded the ordinary law-courts in cases where they were
                too weak to act. The Act simply supplied machinery for the exercise under special
                circumstances of that extraordinary penal jurisdiction which the council had never
                ceased to possess. This jurisdiction, Bacon tells us, was still further developed
                aud organized by Wolsey. The court established by thø</p>
