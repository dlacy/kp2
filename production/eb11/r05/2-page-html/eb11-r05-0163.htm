<p><span class="font0">election, through a series of electoral colleges. It was a simple matter to manipulate these so as to throw the effective power&nbsp;into the hands of the propertied classes without ostensibly&nbsp;depriving any one of the vote.@@<sup>1</sup> The result was that&nbsp;in the third Duma, which met on the 15th of November&nbsp;1907, the conservative Right preponderated as much&nbsp;as the Left had done in its two predecessors. Its president,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">M. Khomiakov, had been one of the founders of the “ Union&nbsp;of 17 October/’ but even the Octobrists formed but a third of&nbsp;the House and were compelled to act with the reactionaries&nbsp;of the Right; and the vice-president, Prince Volkonsky, was a&nbsp;member of the Union of the Russian People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the whole, the new Duma was fairly representative of the changed temper of the Russian people, disillusioned and weary&nbsp;of anarchy. The government had done wisely in obscuring&nbsp;the passion for democratic ideals by an appeal to Russian&nbsp;chauvinism, an appeal soon to bear fruit in disuniting the&nbsp;revolutionary parties. The congress of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos,</span><span class="font0"> hitherto the&nbsp;focus of Liberalism, had petitioned the government, before the&nbsp;opening of the third Duma, to take measures for the restoration&nbsp;of order. The authorities began to exhibit something of their&nbsp;old spirit. M. Dubrovin, president of the Union of the Russian&nbsp;People and organizer of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pogroms,</span><span class="font0"> having written a letter of congratulation to the tsar on the occasion of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup d'état,</span><span class="font0"> received&nbsp;a gracious reply; the hideous reign of terror of the “ Black&nbsp;Hundred ” in Odessa did not prevent the Grand-duke Constantine from accepting the badge of membership of the Union.&nbsp;The ordinary laws, too, had been suspended; the fining and&nbsp;confiscation of newspapers had been resumed, and the “ Cadets ”&nbsp;had been forbidden to hold a congress. All this, however,&nbsp;did not argue an intention on the part of the government to&nbsp;revert to the autocratic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">status quo.</span><span class="font0"> M. Stolypin indeed defended&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup d'état</span><span class="font0"> in the Duma on the ground that the autocrat&nbsp;had merely altered what the autocrat had originally granted;&nbsp;but, while laying stress on the necessity for restoring order in&nbsp;the body politic, he announced a long programme of reforms,&nbsp;including agrarian measures, reform of local government and&nbsp;its extension in the frontier provinces, and state insurance of&nbsp;workmen. The most far-reaching of these reforms, carried in&nbsp;the first session of the third Duma, was the partial abolition&nbsp;of the communal and family ownership of land, which involved&nbsp;the establishment of a class of true peasant-proprietors.@@<sup>2 </sup>Besides this, the Duma had passed before its adjournment on the&nbsp;28th of October 1908 much useful legislation, some 300 bills in&nbsp;all, including two for the building of important railways on the&nbsp;Amur and in Siberia. Nor had it exhibited by any means&nbsp;a wholly docile spirit. On the 7th of June, for instance, M.&nbsp;Guchkov attacked the maladministration in the navy, pointing&nbsp;out that no reforms were possible so long as grand-dukes were&nbsp;at the head of its departments. The Duma endorsed this all&nbsp;but unanimously, and as the result the Grand-dukes Peter and&nbsp;•Sergius resigned their posts of inspector-general of Engineers&nbsp;and Ordnance respectively, and the* Grand-duke Nicholas his&nbsp;chairmanship of the Committee of National Defence. A year&nbsp;later the Duma again came into collision with the government&nbsp;in a matter highly illuminating of the struggle between the&nbsp;ancient traditions and the new ideas in Russia. On the&nbsp;14th of June 1909 a bill was passed removing the disabilities&nbsp;hitherto attaching to some 15,000,000 of Old Believers. In spite&nbsp;of strenuous government opposition, inspired by the authorities&nbsp;of the Orthodox Church, amendments were carried allowing dissident ministers to assume ecclesiastical titles and to preach, and&nbsp;permitting Christians to join non-Christian religions or even to&nbsp;describe themselves as unbelievers. Thus a step forward was made&nbsp;in securing the freedom of conscience proclaimed in the October&nbsp;manifesto and denounced by a synod of Orthodox bishops at Kiev&nbsp;in 1908, though the rights granted by the Duma were seriously&nbsp;curtailed in the Imperial Council, and have been largely&nbsp;rendered a dead letter by the action of the administration.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile the pan-Russian movement had been gaining apace. At first it bad seemed that the new birth of Russia&nbsp;would lead to a revival of pan-Slavism, directed not,&nbsp;as in the middle of the 19th century, against Austria&nbsp;but against Germany. In May 1908 a deputation of&nbsp;the Slav members of the Austrian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reichsrat</span><span class="font0"> paid a&nbsp;ceremonial visit to the Duma at St Petersburg, and in&nbsp;this <sup>u</sup> neo-Slav ” demonstration M. Dmowski, leader of the Polish&nbsp;party in the Duma, took part. In the following year, however,&nbsp;the situation was completely altered, a result due to the growing anti-Polish feeling in the Duma and, more especially, to the&nbsp;support given by the Austrian Slavs to the annexation of Bosnia&nbsp;and Herzegovina. This event caused the utmost excitement in&nbsp;Russia; the crown prince of Servia, who arrived in St Petersburg on the 28th of October to ask for the armed assistance of&nbsp;the tsar, was received with enthusiasm by all classes of the&nbsp;people; and, though armed interverition was impossible, M.&nbsp;Isvolsky took the lead in the abortive demand for a European&nbsp;conference (see Europe: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> Neo-Slav dreams were now&nbsp;replaced by a passionate desire to consolidate the Russian&nbsp;empire on a purely Russian basis. Even the remnant of the&nbsp;“ Cadets ” had by this time renounced their sympathy with&nbsp;Polish aspirations, and in the matter of Finland the Duma&nbsp;proved itself even more imperial than the emperor himself.&nbsp;The Finnish question is dealt with elsewhere (see Finland:&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> Here it may suffice to mention, as illustrating the&nbsp;changed temper of the Russian national assembly,&nbsp;that the Russian majority of the Duma included&nbsp;among the imperial questions in Finland which the&nbsp;Finnish diet ought to refer to the imperial legislature not&nbsp;only all military matters—as the tsar demanded (Rescript&nbsp;of October 14)—but the question of the use of the Russian&nbsp;language in the grand-duchy, the principles of the Finnish&nbsp;administration, police, justice, education, formation of business&nbsp;companies and of associations, public meetings, the press, the&nbsp;customs tariff, the monetary system, means of communication,&nbsp;and the pilot and lighthouse system. The old tendency illustrated by the outcome of the revolutionary movements of 1848&nbsp;was once more in evidence—the tendency of merely artificial&nbsp;theories of democratic liberty to succumb to the immemorial&nbsp;instinct of race and race ascendancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As an international force Russia had been, of course, all but completely crippled by the outcome of the Japanese War and&nbsp;the subsequent revolution. Her recovery, however,&nbsp;revealed the immense reserves of her strength. On&nbsp;the 30th of July 1907 she signed a convention with&nbsp;Japan of mutual respect for treaty and territorial&nbsp;rights, and guaranteeing the integrity of China. On the 31st&nbsp;of August of the same year the long period of mutual&nbsp;suspicion between Great Britain and Russia was closed by&nbsp;a convention for an amicable settlement of all questions likely&nbsp;to disturb the relations of the two Powers in Asia generally,&nbsp;including the demarcation of Persia into spheres of influence&nbsp;(see Persia: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> This new </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">entente</span><span class="font0"> with Great Britain,&nbsp;cemented by a visit paid by King Edward VII. to the tsar at&nbsp;Reval on the 9th June 1908, helped to knit close once more the&nbsp;loosened alliance with France, and so to preserve the threatened&nbsp;balance of Europe. That in the work of restoring its military&nbsp;position the Russian government had the support of the Russian&nbsp;parliament was proved by a subsidy of £11,000,000 voted by the&nbsp;Duma, on the 30th of December 1909, for the special service of&nbsp;the reorganization and redistribution of the army.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography.—The history of Russia, especially that of the last few years, has formed the subject of a vast number of works, of&nbsp;very varying authority, in many languages. In Russia itself the&nbsp;first great history of the Russian empire was that of N. M. Karamzin&nbsp;(12 vols., St Petersburg, 1818-29; French translation, 11 vols.,&nbsp;1819-26), which, though reactionary in tone and largely superseded, remains a classic. . The next monumental history of Russia,&nbsp;that of Sergei Mikhailovich Soloviev (29 vols., Moscow, 1863-75),&nbsp;marks the enormous advance made since Karamzin’s day in historical method and research. Soloviev's history, from the earliest&nbsp;times to 1774, is based throughout on original investigation of&nbsp;sources, and therefore, though inferior to Karamzin’s work as</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
