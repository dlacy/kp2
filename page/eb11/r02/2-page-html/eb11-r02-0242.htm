<p><span class="font1">place depends on the extent to which these larger groups can dominate the details of the rhythm, and this again depends&nbsp;on the listener’s capacity for grasping large and slow rhythms.&nbsp;In any case, the only “ ultimate ” rhythmic element is the&nbsp;tendency to mark off rhythmic beats into pairs, with a stress&nbsp;on the first of each pair. Where this tendency is resisted, the&nbsp;mind will follow the line of least resistance, which will vary&nbsp;according to the pace and detail of the music. Thus in rapid&nbsp;triple time it is easier to seek duple rhythm in the grouping of&nbsp;bars than in the details within the bars; but if the groups of&nbsp;bars are also triple, or irregular, the mind will fix on the first&nbsp;recurring salient feature for a secondary beat, regardless of&nbsp;inequality in length; rather than, so to speak, hop on one leg&nbsp;indefinitely. On this principle there is a distinct tendency&nbsp;in moderate and slow triple times to throw a secondary accent&nbsp;on the third beat; or sometimes on the second, as in the springing step of the mazurka, where the spring gives energy to the&nbsp;first beat and the descent from it gives poise to the second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tendency of small rhythmic groups to build themselves into large and square ones, such as 8-bar, 16-bar and even&nbsp;32-bar periods, is doubtless important; but the converse&nbsp;tendency of large phrase-rhythms to break up in a tapering&nbsp;series is far more significant, since even in its most regular&nbsp;forms it not only produces more variety the further it goes,&nbsp;but always increases in obvious effect, until the subdivisions&nbsp;attain the minuteness (and therewith the expression) of speech&nbsp;rhythms. (A crude example of the device is DiabellFs waltz,&nbsp;on which Beethoven wrote his gigantic 33 variations. See&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Variations,</span><span class="font1"> where the point is illustrated by a diagram.)&nbsp;Regularly expanding rhythm, on the other hand, not only&nbsp;becomes imperceptible as it is carried further, but tends merely&nbsp;to make musical proportions resemble those of a chess-board.&nbsp;In great music the expanding principle is therefore always&nbsp;contrasted with or modified by the tapering principle, which&nbsp;can indeed exist simultaneously with it and with any other.&nbsp;For, to take only three categories, the harmonic changes of a&nbsp;passage may be designed in tapering rhythm while the melodic&nbsp;phrases expand, and the entries of instruments or parts occur&nbsp;on some third principle, regular or irregular. Such interplay&nbsp;need produce no feeling of complexity; indeed, it is an art&nbsp;most neglected by those composers who most rely on the effect&nbsp;of complex rhythm. It is the main discoverable source of&nbsp;that almost dramatic sense of movement that distinguishes&nbsp;the great musical styles from the academic methods which play&nbsp;for safety, and from the anti-academic novelties which end in&nbsp;monotony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Square rhythms become desirable at climaxes where physical energy dominates thought. Strong final cadences accordingly&nbsp;require that the last chord should fall on an accent; and if the&nbsp;pace is rapid the final chord will probably be not only on an&nbsp;accented beat but on an accented bar. Thus it is quite obvious&nbsp;that there is by a mere oversight one bar too many in the four&nbsp;bars of tremolo quavers at the end of the first movement of&nbsp;Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony; for they are followed by an&nbsp;important bar leading to the last three chords, which chords&nbsp;can only mean (counting bars as beats)— “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">One,</span><span class="font1"> two, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Three ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(“ four” being silent and therefore unwritten). A fifth bar of&nbsp;tremolo would correct the rhythm in a more vigorous but more&nbsp;vulgar way by bringing the last chord onto “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">One</span><span class="font1"> ” of the next&nbsp;imaginary group of four. The former correction is so obviously&nbsp;right that the imagination makes it in spite of the presence of&nbsp;the superfluous bar, which is instinctively ignored as an accidental&nbsp;prolongation of the tremolo. Where the composer writes in&nbsp;bars so short as to be permanently less than the phrases of the&nbsp;piece (as in Beethoven’s scherzos), or in bars that are frequently&nbsp;longer than the phrases (as in most of Mozart’s movements in&nbsp;slow or moderate common time), it sometimes becomes impossible&nbsp;to construe the music without carefully calculating where the&nbsp;accents come; and this calculation is most easily made on the&nbsp;assumption that the strongest cadences bring the tonic chord&nbsp;on an accent. Thus, in Beethoven’s Sonata in E flat, Op. 27,&nbsp;No. I, the first bar of the second movement must be preliminary&nbsp;and the first accent must come on the second bar, since the piece&nbsp;refuses to make sense in any other way. Indeed, Beethoven&nbsp;has written some notes twice over in order to bring his doublebars and repeat-marks where they will indicate the true rhythmic&nbsp;joints to the eye. (A double-bar is a mere graphic indication&nbsp;of some important sectional division, not necessarily rhythmic&nbsp;or even coincident with a normal bar-stroke.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theorists, however, have developed a tendency to assume that all cadences must be strong. More than one critic has&nbsp;told us that the scherzo of Beethoven’s Sonata, Op. 28, is in the&nbsp;same predicament as that of Op. 27, No. 1; though it not only&nbsp;makes excellent sense with its cadences in the light and weak&nbsp;form in which they appear, but, when reconstrued on the “ strong&nbsp;cadence ” theory, entirely fails in its middle portion to uphold&nbsp;that theory or to make any other rhythmic sense. And when&nbsp;Professor Prout tells us that the overture to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Figaro</span><span class="font1"> begins with a&nbsp;silent bar, and that Schubert’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Impromptu</span><span class="font1"> in B flat is positively&nbsp;ungrammatical in its cadences unless it is entirely rebarred,&nbsp;and when Dr Riemann turns half the ritornello </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> a Bach concerto from £ into time, simply in order to make the sequences&nbsp;coincide with the hardest possible accents; then we can only&nbsp;protest that this is regulating musical aesthetics by criteria too&nbsp;crude for the aesthetics of bricklaying. An edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise&nbsp;Lost,</span><span class="font1"> in which the lines were so rearranged as to bring all punctuation marks (except perhaps commas) at the end of the line,&nbsp;would be on precisely the same level of ingenious barbarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Few technical terms are entirely peculiar to the subject of musical rhythm; but some obvious terms of syntax, such as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">phrase, period</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">section</span><span class="font1"> are used with varying degrees of system&nbsp;by all writers on music; and the whole terminology of prosody&nbsp;has been annexed—with such success that we are told in Grove’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary</span><span class="font1"> (article, “ Metre ”) that “ the theme of Weber’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rondo brillante</span><span class="font1"> in E flat (Op. 62) is in Anapaestic Tetrameter&nbsp;Brachycatalectic, very rigidly maintained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One important term has acquired a special significance in music: viz. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Syncopation.</span><span class="font1"> It means a cross-accent of such&nbsp;strength as to equal or even suppress the main accent; but the&nbsp;use of the term is generally restricted to cases in which the crossaccent is produced by shifting the notes of a melody or a formula&nbsp;so that they fall between the beats instead of upon them. From&nbsp;what we have said as to the almost physical energy of musical&nbsp;rhythm it is obvious that such a phenomenon is of far greater&nbsp;effect and importance in music than it could possibly be in&nbsp;verse; and, to whichever subject the term may belong by&nbsp;priority, extreme caution is needed in extending any musical&nbsp;notion of it to the structure of poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.

<p><span class="font1">RHYTINA, a name applied to the northern sea-cow </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhytina gigas,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stelleri),</span><span class="font1"> a gigantic relative of the manati and dugong,&nbsp;which formerly inhabited Bering and Copper Islands, in the&nbsp;North Pacific, where it was discovered during Bering’s voyage&nbsp;in 1741, and subsequently described by Steiler, who accompanied&nbsp;that expedition as a naturalist. Bering’s half-starved sailors&nbsp;soon reduced the numbers of these comparatively helpless&nbsp;creatures; and it was not long after—probably about the year&nbsp;1768—that the species, which was the sole representative of&nbsp;its genus, became completely exterminated. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhytina</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;the largest member of the order Sirenia, attaining a length of&nbsp;nearly twenty feet; and had a very thick, rugged, bark-like&nbsp;skin. The jaws, which are bent downwards to a moderate&nbsp;extent, are unprovided with teeth, but in life carried ridged&nbsp;horny plates. The tail was very deeply forked; and the&nbsp;flippers were short and truncated, Iaclring apparently the&nbsp;terminal joints of the digits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When first discovered, this Sirenian was extremely numerous in the bays of Bering Island, where it browsed upon the abundant&nbsp;sea-tangle. Its extirpation is due to the Russian sailors and&nbsp;traders who visited the island in pursuit of seals and sea-otters,&nbsp;and who subsisted on its flesh. Numbers of bones have been&nbsp;discovered in the soil of Bering and Copper Islands, from which&nbsp;more or less nearly perfect skeletons have been reconstructed,&nbsp;so that the osteology of this interesting animal is well represented&nbsp;in most of the larger museums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R.
