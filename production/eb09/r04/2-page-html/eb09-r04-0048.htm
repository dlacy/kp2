<p><span class="font0">translated parts of Horace. Besides his satires, he published versions of Fontenelle’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pluralité des Mondes</span><span class="font0"> and the histories of Justin and Cornelius Nepos. He was for&nbsp;some time Russian ambassador at the courts of London&nbsp;and Paris. But more celebrated than these men was&nbsp;Michael Lomonosofe (q</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.v.).</span><span class="font0"> He was an indefatigable&nbsp;writer of verse and prose, and has left odes, tragedies,&nbsp;didactic poetry, essays, and fragments of epics ; without&nbsp;being a man of great genius he did much to advance&nbsp;the education of his country. He also made many valuable contributions to science. Basil Tatistcheff (1686—&nbsp;1750), a statesman of eminence, was the author of a Russian history which, although written in a confused style&nbsp;and hardly superior to a chronicle, is interesting as&nbsp;the first attempt in that field, which was afterwards so&nbsp;successfully cultivated by Karamzin, Solovieff, and Kosto-maroff. His work was not given to the world till after&nbsp;his death. There had been a slight sketch published&nbsp;before by Khilkoff, entitled the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harrow of Russian History.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Basil Trediakovski (1703-1769) was but a poor poetaster,&nbsp;in spite of his many productions. He was born at&nbsp;Astrakhan, and we are told that Peter, passing through&nbsp;that city at the time of his Persian expedition, had&nbsp;Trediakovski pointed out to him as one of the most&nbsp;promising boys of the school there. Whereupon, having&nbsp;questioned him, the czar said, with truly prophetic insight,&nbsp;“ A busy worker, but master of nothing.” His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Telemakhida,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a poem in which he versified the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Telemaque</span><span class="font0"> of Fénelon,&nbsp;drew upon him the derision of the wits of the time. He&nbsp;had frequently to endure the rough horse-play of the&nbsp;courtiers, for the position of a literary man at that time in&nbsp;Russia was not altogether a cheerful one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth Russian literature made great progress, the French&nbsp;furnishing models. Alexander Sumarokoff (1718-1777)&nbsp;wrote prose and verse in abundance—comedies, tragedies,&nbsp;idyls, satires, and epigrams. He is, perhaps, best entitled&nbsp;to remembrance for his plays, which are rhymed, and in&nbsp;the French style. It took the Russians some time to find&nbsp;out that their language was capable of the unrhymed&nbsp;iambic line, which is the most suitable for tragedy. His&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dmitri Samozvanetz</span><span class="font0"> (“Demetrius the Pretender”) is&nbsp;certainly not without merit. Some of the pieces of&nbsp;Kniazhnin had great success in their time, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Chatterbox, The Originals,</span><span class="font0"> and especially </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Fatal Carriage.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">He is now, however, almost forgotten. In 1756 the first&nbsp;theatre was opened at St Petersburg, the director being&nbsp;Sumarokoff. Up to this time the Russians had acted&nbsp;only religious plays, such as those written by Simeon&nbsp;Polotzki. The reign of Catherine II. (1762—96) saw the&nbsp;rise of a whole generation of court poets, many of whom&nbsp;were at best but poor writers. Everything in Russia was&nbsp;to be forced like plants in a hot-house ; she was to have&nbsp;Homers, Pindars, Horaces, and Virgils. Michael Kheraskoff&nbsp;(1733—1807) wrote besides other poems two enormous&nbsp;epics—the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rossiada</span><span class="font0"> in twelve books, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vladimir</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;eighteen ; they are now but little read. Although they&nbsp;are tedious poems on the whole, yet we occasionally find&nbsp;spirited passages. Bogdanovich (1743-1803) wrote a&nbsp;pretty lyric piece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dushenka,</span><span class="font0"> based upon La Fontaine,&nbsp;and telling the old story of the loves of Cupid and Psyche.&nbsp;Perhaps the elegance of the versification is the best thing&nbsp;to be found in it. With Ivan Khemnitzer begins the&nbsp;long list of fabulists ; this Iialf-Oriental form of literature,&nbsp;so common in countries ruled absolutely, has been very&nbsp;popular iu Russia. Khemnitzer (1744-1784), whose name&nbsp;seems to imply a German origin, began by translating&nbsp;the fables of Geliert, but afterwards produced original&nbsp;specimens of this kind of literature. A writer of real&nbsp;national comedy appeared in Denis von Visin, probably of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">German extraction, but born at Moscow (1745-1792). His best production is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nedorosl</span><span class="font0"> (“The Minor”), in which&nbsp;he satirizes the coarse features of Russian society, the ill-treatment of the serfs, and other matters. The colouring&nbsp;of the piece is truly national. He has also left some very&nbsp;good letters describing his travels. He saw France on the&nbsp;eve of the great Revolution, and has well described what&nbsp;he did see. Russian as he was, and accustomed to&nbsp;serfdom, he was yet astonished at the wretched condition of the French peasants. The great poet of the age&nbsp;of Catherine, the laureate of her glories, was Gabriel&nbsp;Derzhavin (1743-1816). He essayed many styles of&nbsp;composition, and was ε great master of his native language.&nbsp;Many of his lyric pieces are full of fire. No one can deny&nbsp;the poet a vigorous imagination and a great power of&nbsp;expressing his ideas. There is something grandiose and&nbsp;organ-like in his high-sounding verses ; unfortunately he&nbsp;occasionally degenerates into bombast. His versification&nbsp;is perfect ; and he had the courage, rare at the time, to&nbsp;write satirically of many persons of high rank. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ode&nbsp;to God</span><span class="font0"> is the best known of his poems in Western countries.&nbsp;We can see from some of his pieces that ho was a student&nbsp;of Edward Young, the author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Night Thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Tawdry rhetoric, containing, however, occasionally fine and&nbsp;original thoughts, rendered this writer popular throughout&nbsp;Europe. Other celebrated poems of Derzhavin are the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odes on the Death of Prince Mestcherski, The Nobleman,&nbsp;The Taking of Ismail,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Taking of Warsaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Au unfortunate author of the days of Catherine was Alexander Radistcheff, who, having, in a small work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journey to Moscow,</span><span class="font0"> spoken too severely of the miserable&nbsp;condition of the serfs, was punished by banishment to&nbsp;Siberia, from which he was afterwards allowed to return,&nbsp;but not till his health had been permanently injured by&nbsp;his sufferings. An equally sad fate befell the spirited&nbsp;writer Novikoff, who, after having worked hard as a&nbsp;journalist, and done much for education in Russia, fell&nbsp;under the suspicion of the Government, and was&nbsp;imprisoned by Catherine. On her death he was released&nbsp;by her successor. The short reign of Paul was not favourable to literary production ; the censorship of the press&nbsp;was extremely severe, and many foreign books were&nbsp;excluded from Russia. Authors and lovers of literature&nbsp;were liable to get into trouble, as we see by the experiences&nbsp;of the poet Kotzebue and pastor Seidler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But a better state of things came with the reign of Alexander, one of the glories of whose days was Nicholas&nbsp;Karamzin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> His chief work is his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the&nbsp;Russian Empire,</span><span class="font0"> but he appeared in the fourfold aspect of&nbsp;historian, novelist, essayist, and poet. Nor need we do&nbsp;more than mention the celebrated Archbishop Platon&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> Ivan Dmitrieff (1760-1837) wrote some pleasing&nbsp;lyrics and epistles, but without much force. He is like&nbsp;some feeble British poets towards the close of last century, in whom the elegance of the diction will not atone&nbsp;for the feebleness of the ideas. He appears from his&nbsp;translations to have been well acquainted with the English&nbsp;poets. Ozeroff wrote a great many tragedies, which are&nbsp;but little read now. They are in rhyming alexandrines.&nbsp;His form belongs to the false classical school, but he&nbsp;occasionally handled native subjects with success, as in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dmitri Donskoi</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yaropolk and Oleg.</span><span class="font0"> In Ivan&nbsp;Kriloff (1768-1844) the Russians found their most genial&nbsp;fabulist. His pieces abound with vigorous pictures of&nbsp;Russian national life, and many of his lines are standard&nbsp;quotations with the Russians, just as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hudibrax</span><span class="font0"> is with ourselves. Long before his death Kriloff had become the&nbsp;most popular man in Russia. He resembled La Fontaine&nbsp;not only in the style of his verse but in his manner of life.&nbsp;He was the same careless, unpractical sort of person, and</span></p>
