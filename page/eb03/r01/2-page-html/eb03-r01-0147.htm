<p><span class="font1">ſtraiglit lines and with an accelerated motion, and at laſt darted into the orifice with great rapidity. He&nbsp;had obſerved a thing ſimilar to this in a horizontal ca-nal, in which he had fet up a ſmall board like a dam or&nbsp;bar, over wh'eh the water flowed. He had thrown a&nbsp;gooſtberry into the water, in order to meaſure the velo-city at the bottom, the goofet&gt;erry being a fmall matter&nbsp;heavier than water. It approached the dam uniformly till about three inches from it. Here it almoſt ſtood&nbsp;ſtill, but it continued to advance till almoſt in contact.&nbsp;It then roſe from the bottom along the inlide of the&nbsp;dam with an accelerated motion, and quickly eſcaped&nbsp;over the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence he concluded, that the water which covers the anterior part of the body expofed to the ſtream is&nbsp;not perfectly ſtag.nant, and that the filaments recede&nbsp;from the axis in curves, which converge to the ſurface&nbsp;of the body as different hyperbolas converge to the&nbsp;fame affymptote, and that they move with a velocity&nbsp;continually increafing till they eſcape round the ſides&nbsp;ef the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He had eſtabliſhed (by a pretty reaſonable theory, confirmed by experiment) a propoſition concerning the&nbsp;preffure which water in motion exerts on the ſurface&nbsp;along which it glides, viz. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">that the prejfure is equal to that&nbsp;which it would exert if at reft</span><span class="font1"> minus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the weight of the column whoſe height would produce the velocity of the paftlng&nbsp;(lream.</span><span class="font1"> Conſequently the preffure which the ftream&nbsp;exerts on the ſurface perpendicularly expofed to it will&nbsp;depend on the velocity with which it glides along it,&nbsp;and will diminiſh from the centre to the circumference.&nbsp;This, ſays he, may be the reaſon why the impnlſe&nbsp;on a plane wholly immerſed is but one half of that on&nbsp;a plane which deflects the whole ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He contrived a very ingenious inſtrument ſor exami-ning this theory. A fquare braſs plate ABGF (fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) was pierced with a great number of holes, and fixed&nbsp;in the front of a ſhallow box repreſented edgewiſe in fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The back of this box was pierced with a hole r,&nbsp;in which was inferted the tube of glaſs CDE, bent&nbsp;fquare at D. This inſtrument was expofed to a ſtream&nbsp;of water, which beat on the braſs plate. The water&nbsp;having ſilled the box through the holes, ſiood at an&nbsp;equal height in the glaſs tube when the ſurrounding&nbsp;water was ſtagnant ; but when it was in motion, it always ſiood in the tube above the level of the ſmooth&nbsp;water without, and thus indicated the preffure occaſion-ed by the action of the ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when the inſtrument was not wholly immerfed, there was always a conſiderable accumulation againſt the front&nbsp;of the box, and a depreſſion behind it. The water before&nbsp;it was by no means ſtagnant : indeed it ſhould not be,&nbsp;as Mr Buat obſerves ; for it conſiſts of the water which&nbsp;was eſcaping on all ſides, and therefore upwards from&nbsp;the axis of the ſtream, which meets the plate perpendi-cularly in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> conſiderably under the ſurface. It eſcapes&nbsp;upwards ; and if the body were fuſſiciently immerſed,&nbsp;it would eſcape in this direction almoſt as eaſily as&nbsp;laterally. But in the preſent circumſtances, it heaps&nbsp;up, till the elevation occaſions it to fall off ſidewiſe as&nbsp;faſt as it is renewed, when the inſtrument was immerfed more than its ſemidiameter under the ſurface, the&nbsp;water- ſtill roſe above the level, and there was a great&nbsp;depreſſion immediately behind this elevation. In con-Lquence of this difficulty of eſcaping upwards, the wa-ter flows off laterally ; and if the horizontal </span><span class="font0">dim¢nſions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the lurface is great, this lateral efflux becomes more&nbsp;difficult, and requires a greater accumulation. From&nbsp;this it happens, that the reſiſtance of broad ſurfaces&nbsp;equally immerſed is greater than in the proportion of&nbsp;the breadth. A plane of two feet wide and one foot&nbsp;deep, when it is not completely immerſed, will be more&nbsp;refilled than a plane two feet deep and one foot wide ;&nbsp;ſor there will be an accumulation againſt both : and&nbsp;even if theſe were equal in height, the additional fur-face will be greateſt in the wideſt body ; and- the ele-vation will be greater, becaufe the lateral eſcape is more&nbsp;difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The circumſtances chiefly to be attended to are theſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The preffure on the centre was much greater than towards the border, and, in general, the height oſ the water in the tube DE was more than ∙∣ of the height ue-ceffary for producing the velocity when only the central hole was open, when various holes were opened at different diſtances from the centre, the height of the&nbsp;water in DH continually diminiſhed as the hole was&nbsp;nearer the border. At a certain diſtance from the border the water at E was level with the ſurrounding water, ſo that no preffure was exerted on that hole. But&nbsp;the moft unexpected and remarkable circumſtance was,&nbsp;that, in great velocities, the holes at the very border,&nbsp;and even to a ſmall diſtance from it, not only ſuſtained&nbsp;no preffure, but even gave out water ; for the water in&nbsp;the tube was lower than the ſurrounding water. Mr&nbsp;Buat calls this a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r.on-prejfιυn.</span><span class="font1"> In a caſe in which the&nbsp;velocity ot the ſtream was three feet, and the preffure on&nbsp;the central hole cauſed the water in the vertical tube to&nbsp;ſtahd 33 lines or ⅜⅜ of an inch above the level of the&nbsp;ſuriounding ſmooth water, the action on a hole at the&nbsp;lower corner of the ſquare cauſed it to ſtand 12 line»&nbsp;lower than the furrounding water. Now the velocity&nbsp;of the ſtream in this experiment was 36 inches </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font1"> ſecond. This requires 21⅜ lines for its productive fall ;&nbsp;whereas thc preffure on the central hole was 33. This&nbsp;approaches to the preffure on a ſurface which deflects&nbsp;it wholly. The intermediate holes gave every variation&nbsp;of preffure, and the diminution was more rapid as the&nbsp;holes were nearer the edge j but the law of diminution could not be obferved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is quite a new and moſt unexpected circumſtance in the action of fluids on ſolid bodies, and renders the ſubject more intricate than ever ; yet it is by no means inconliſtent with the genuine principles of&nbsp;hydroſtatics or hydraulics. In as far as Mr Buat’s&nbsp;propoſttion conccrning the preffure of moving fluids&nbsp;is true, it is very reaſonable to fay, that when the&nbsp;lateral velocity with which the fluid tends to eſcape&nbsp;exceeds the velocity of percuiſion, the height neceffa-ry for producing this velocity muſt exceed that which&nbsp;would produce the other, and a non-preffion muſt be&nbsp;obſerved. And if we conſider the forms of the la-teral filaments near the edge of the body, we ſee that&nbsp;the concavity of the curve is turned towards the body, and that the centrifugal forces tend to diminiſh.&nbsp;their preffure on the body. If the middle alone were&nbsp;ſtruck with a confiderable velocity, the water might&nbsp;even rebound, as is frequently obferved. This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actual&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">rebounding is here prevented by the ſurrounding wa</span><span class="font0">ter, which is moving </span><span class="font1">with </span><span class="font0">the fame velocity ; </span><span class="font1">but</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
