The first method will require the course to be lengthened in the proportion of 24<sup>2</sup> to 38*94<sup>2</sup>, or nearly of 38 to 100. The expense of this would be enormous. The second method will require the hydraulic mean depth to be increased nearly in&nbsp;the same proportion (because the velocities are nearly as&nbsp;5∕f∕</span><span class="font0">∖</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">—=J. This will evidently be much less costly and, even √*∕</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to procure convenient room for the navigation, must be preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We must now observe, that the great velocity of which we are afraid obtains only during the winter floods. If&nbsp;therefore we reduce this to 24 inches, it must happen that&nbsp;the autumnal freshes, loaded with sand and mud, will certainly deposit a part of it, and choke up our channel below&nbsp;the floodgates. We must therefore select a mean velocity&nbsp;somewhat exceeding the regimen, that it may carry off these&nbsp;depositions. We shall take 27 inches, which will produce&nbsp;this effect on the loose mud without endangering our channel in any remarkable degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore we have, by the theorem for uniform motion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V = 27 = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—0*3 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L/d —</span><span class="font1"> 0*l). Calcu-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">lating the divisor of this formula, we find it = 55-884. Hence 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">√cZ—0∙1= -297-= 5∙3483, and therefore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">55*884</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">= 30-⅛. Having thus determined the hydraulic mean depth, we find the area S of the section by dividing the&nbsp;discharge 1514169 by the velocity 27. This gives us&nbsp;56080*368. Then we get the breadth B by the formula formerly given B =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—2S +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1802*296 inches,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">or 150*19 feet, and the depth </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font1"> = 31*115 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With these dimensions of the section, w-e are certain that the channel will be permanent ; and the cills of the floodgate being all fixed agreeably to the primitive slope, we&nbsp;need not fear that it will be changed in the intervals by the&nbsp;action of the current. The gates being all open during the&nbsp;freshes, the bottom will be cleared of the whole deposited&nbsp;mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We must now station the floodgates along the new channel, at such distances that w-e may have the depth of water which is proper for the lighters that are to be employed in&nbsp;the navigation. Suppose this to be four feet. We must&nbsp;first of all learn how high the w-ater will be kept in this new&nbsp;channel during the summer droughts. There remained in&nbsp;the primitive channel only two feet, and the section in this&nbsp;case had twenty feet eight inches mean width ; and the discharge corresponding to this section and slope <sub>y</sub>⅛<sub>0</sub>- is, by&nbsp;the theorem of uniform motion, 130849 cubic inches per&nbsp;second. To find the depth of water in the new channel&nbsp;corresponding to this discharge and the same slope, we must&nbsp;take the method of approximation formerly exemplified, remembering that the discharge D is 130849, and the breadth&nbsp;B is 1760*8 at the bottom (the slant sides being four thirds).&nbsp;These data will produce a depth of water = 6½ inches. To&nbsp;obtain four feet therefore behind any of the floodgates, we&nbsp;must have a swell of 41 j inches produced by the gate below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We must now determine the width of passage which must be given at the gates. This will regulate the thickness of the sheet of water which flows over them when&nbsp;shut; and this, with the height of the gate, fixes the swell&nbsp;at the gate. The extent of this swell, and the elevation of&nbsp;every point of its curved surface above the new surface of&nbsp;the river, require a combination of the height of swell at the&nbsp;floodgate, with the primitive slope and the new velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These bemg computed, the stations of the gates may h assigned, which will secure four feet of water behind eac&nbsp;in summer. We need not give these computations, haι&nbsp;ing already exemplified them all with relation to anothι&nbsp;river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This examp.e not only illustrates the method of procee&lt; ing, so as to be insured of success, but also gives us a pr&lt;&nbsp;cise instance of what must be done in a case which cannι&nbsp;but frequently occur. We see what a prodigious excav;&nbsp;tion is necessary in order to obtain permanency. We hav&nbsp;been obliged to enlarge the primitive bed to about thru&nbsp;its former size, so that the excavation is at least two thin&nbsp;of what the other method required. The expense, hov&nbsp;ever, will still be vastly inferior to the other, both from tl&nbsp;nature of the work and the quantity of ground occupie&nbsp;At all events, the expense is enormous, and what con&nbsp;never be repaid by the navigation, except in a very riι&nbsp;and populous country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is another circumstance to be attended to. Tl navigation of this river by sluices must be very desultor&nbsp;unless they are extremely numerous, and of small height&nbsp;The natural surface of the swell being concave upwards, tl&nbsp;additions made by its different parts to the primitive heigl&nbsp;of the river decrease rapidly as they approach to the pla&lt;&nbsp;A (fig. 23), where the swell terminates ; and three gate&nbsp;each of which raises the water one foot when placed at tl&nbsp;proper distance from each other, will raise the water muι&nbsp;more than two gates at twice this distance, each raising tl&nbsp;water two feet. Moreover, when the elevation produc&lt;&nbsp;by a floodgate is considerable, exceeding a very few inche&nbsp;the fall and current produced by the opening of the gate&nbsp;such that no boat can possibly pass up the river, and&nbsp;runs imminent risk of being overset and sunk in the a&nbsp;tempt to go down the stream. This renders the navigati(&nbsp;desultory. A number of lighters collect themselves at tl&nbsp;gates, and wait their opening. They pass through as so&lt;&nbsp;as the current becomes moderate. This would not, pe&nbsp;haps, be very hurtful in a regulated navigation, if they cou&nbsp;then proceed on their voyage. But the boats bound up tl&nbsp;river must stay on the upper side of the gate which th&lt;&nbsp;have just now passed, because the channel is now too shi&nbsp;low for them to proceed. Those bound down the river </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">only go to the next gate, unless it has been opened at&nbsp;time nicely adjusted to the opening of the one above&nbsp;The passage downwards </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">may,</span><span class="font1"> in many cases, be continue&nbsp;by very intelligent and attentive lockmen ; but the passai&nbsp;up </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font1"> be exceedingly tedious. Nay, we may say, th&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">while</span><span class="font1"> the passage downw<sup>,</sup>ards is continuous, it is but in&nbsp;very few cases that the passage upward is practicable,&nbsp;we add to these inconveniences the great danger of pass&nbsp;during the freshes, while all the gates are open, and tl&nbsp;immense and unavoidable accumulations of ice, on occasiι&nbsp;even of slight frosts, we may see that this method of pr&nbsp;curing an inland navigation is amazingly expensive, desι&nbsp;tory, tedious, and hazardous. It did not therefore mer&nbsp;on its own account, the attention we have bestowed on&nbsp;But the discussion was absolutely necessary, in order&nbsp;show what must be done in order to obtain effect and pc&nbsp;manency, and thus to prevent us from engaging in a pr&nbsp;ject which, to a person not duly and confidently informe&nbsp;is so feasible and promising. Many professional enginee&nbsp;are ready, and with honest intentions, to undertake suι&nbsp;tasks ; and by avoiding tllis immense expense, and conter&nbsp;ing themselves with a much narrower channel, they su&nbsp;ceed : witness the old navigation of the river Mersey. B&nbsp;the w ork has no duration ; and, not having been found ve&nbsp;serviceable, its cessation is not matter of much regret. Tl&nbsp;work is not much spoken of during its continuance. It&nbsp;soon forgotten, as well as its failure, and engineers are foui&nbsp;ready to engage for such another.</span></p>
