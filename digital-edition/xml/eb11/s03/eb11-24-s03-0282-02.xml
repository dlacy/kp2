This word represents the Icel. <hi rend="italic">skãld,</hi> Dan. <hi rend="italic">skald,</hi> Swed. <hi rend="italic">skjald,</hi> the regular term for a poet. Authorities differ as to its derivation. It seems certain that the word was originally derogatory in sense; some connect it with <hi rend="italic">skālda,</hi> a pole, on which libels were cut. Others, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Skeat, refer it to Swed. <hi rend="italic">skalla,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">skjalla,</hi> to make a loud noise or clatter, and take the original sense to have been a “ loud talker.” This would link the word with “ scold,’’ to rail at, find fault with, which is formed from Dutch <hi rend="italic">schold,</hi> past tense of <hi rend="italic">scheldan,</hi> cf. Ger. <hi rend="italic">schelten,</hi> in the same sense.</p><p>Of different origin is the verb “ scald,” to burn or injure the skin or flesh by hot liquid or steam (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Burns and Scalds);</hi> also to cleanse an object, or to remove hair, bristles, feathers &amp;amp;c., from an animal, by exposure to moist heat, such as boiling water, steam, &amp;amp;c. This word is derived from the O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">escalder, eschauder,</hi> mod. <hi rend="italic">échauder,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">excaldare,</hi> to wash with hot water (<hi rend="italic">caldus, calidus,</hi> hot).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
