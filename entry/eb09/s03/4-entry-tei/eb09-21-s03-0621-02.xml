About 120 species are enumerated in this genus of <hi rend="italic">Crassulace√¶,</hi> mostly perennial herbs with succulent leaves of varied form, but never compound. The individual flowers are usually small and grouped in cymes. In colour they range from white and yellow to pink. They have a calyx of five sepals, as many petals, usually ten stamens, and five distinct carpels, which have as many glands at their base and ripen into as many dry seed-pods. Several species are British, including some with tuberous roots and large leaves <hi rend="italic">(Telephium),</hi> and others of smaller size, chiefly found on rocks, walls, and dry banks. Many are cultivated for the beauty of their flowers, and many are remarkable for their prolonged vitality under adverse circumstances. Sedums are very closely allied to Sempervivums (see Houseleek).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
