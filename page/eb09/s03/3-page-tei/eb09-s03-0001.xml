            <p>SEDITION CONTD United Kingdom, as by law established, or either House of Parliament, or the
                administration of justice, or to excite Her Majesty's subjects to attempt otherwise
                than by lawful means the alteration of any matter in church or state by law
                established, or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst Her Majesty’s subjects,
                or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of Her
                Majesty’s subjects. An intention to show that Her Majesty has been misled or
                mistaken in her measures, or to point out errors or defects in the Government or
                constitution as by law established, with a view to their reformation, or to excite
                Her Majesty’s subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in
                church or state by law established, or to point out, in order to their removal,
                matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and
                ill-will between different classes of Her Majesty’s subjects, is not a seditious
                intention. In determining whether the intention with which any words were spoken,
                any document was published, or any agreement was made, was or was not seditious,
                every person must be deemed to intend the consequences which would naturally follow
                from his conduct at the time and under the circumstances in which he so conducted
                himself” <hi rend="italic">(Digest of the Criminal Law,</hi> §§ 91-94).</p>
            <p>The principal enactments now in force dealing with seditious offences were all passed
                during the last twenty- five years of the reign of George III. They are 37 Geo. III.
                c. 123, prohibiting the administering or taking of unlawful oaths (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Oath)</hi> or the belonging to an unlawful confederacy; 60 Geo.
                III. and 1 Geo. IV. c. 1, prohibiting unlawful drilling and military exercises ; and
                the Acts for the suppression of corresponding societies, 39 Geo. III. c. 79 and 57
                Geo. III. c. 19. No proceedings can be instituted under these last two Acts without
                the authority of the law officers of the crown (9 and 10 Vict. c. 33). Under the
                head of statutes aimed at seditious offences may also be classed 2 Ric. II. st. 1,
                c. 5 and 12 Ric. II. c. 11, against <hi rend="italic">scandalum magnatum</hi> or
                slander of great men, such as peers, judges, or great officers of state, whereby
                discord may arise within the realm, and 13 Car. II. c. 5, against tumultuous
                petitioning (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Petition).</hi> There has been no prosecution
                in recent times for seditious words as distinguished from seditious libel, but such
                words have been admitted as evidence in proceedings for seditious <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Conspiracy</hi> (q.v.), as in the prosecution of O’Connell in
                1844 and of Mr Parnell and others in 1880 (see Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.
                </hi>Parnell, Cox’s <hi rend="italic">Criminal Cases,</hi> vol. xiv. 508). By the
                Prison Act, 1877, any prisoner under sentence for sedition or seditious libel is to
                be treated as a misdemeanant of the first division (40 and 41 Vict. c. 21, s.
                40).</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi>"All acts by which the minds of the people may be
                incited to defeat the Government or control legislation by violent or
                unconstitutional means are seditious” (Macdonald, <hi rend="italic">Criminal
                    Law,</hi> 229). Sedition is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (6 Geo.
                IV. c. 47). A very large number of Acts of the Scottish Parliament dealt with
                sedition, beginning as early as 1184 with the assize of William the Lion, c. 29.
                Leasing-making is to be distinguished from sedition, as it attacked only the
                sovereign individually, not the Government.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi>In the Acts of Congress the word “sedition”
                appears to occur only in the army and navy articles. A soldier joining any sedition
                or who, being present at any sedition, does not use his utmost endeavour to suppress
                the same is punishable with death. A sailor uttering seditious words is punishable
                at the discretion of a court-martial. In 1798 an Act of Congress called the Sedition
                Act was passed, which expired by effluxion of time in 1801. Its constitutionality
                was violently assailed at the time. (See Story on the constitution of the United
                States, §§ 1293-4.) Several prosecutions under the Act will be found in Wharton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">State Trials. </hi>Sedition is also dealt with by the State
                laws mostly in a very liberal spirit. Thus the Louisiana Code, § 394, enacts that
                “there is no such offence known to our law as defamation of the Government or either
                of its branches, either under the name of libel, slander, seditious writing, or
                other appellation.” By § 111, to constitute the offence of sedition “there must be
                not only a design to dismember the State, or to subvert or change its constitution,
                but an attempt must be made to do it by force. ”</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Continent of Europe.—</hi>The Continental codes as a rule are
                little more definite than English law in their treatment of sedition. In Germany a
                distinction is drawn between <hi rend="italic">Auflauf,</hi> the remaining together
                of a mob after the authorities have thrice bid it disperse, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aufruhr</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aufstand,</hi> an organized resistance to the
                authorities ; but no definition is given of the terms. The Hungarian</p>
            <p>penal code defines <hi rend="italic">Aufstand</hi> to be an armed assembly which has
                the intention of attacking a class of citizens, a nationality, or a religious body.
                The French penal code recognizes a difference between <hi rend="italic"
                    >sédition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">réunion séditieuse.</hi> If carried out
                with sufficient numbers and sufficient force <hi rend="italic">sédition</hi> becomes
                    <hi rend="italic">rébellion.</hi> Section 100 exempts from the penalties of
                sedition those who have merely been present at a seditious meeting without taking
                any active part therein, and have dispersed at the first warning of the military or
                civil authorities.</p>
            <p>SEDLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles</hi> (1639-1701), a noted “wit” and patron
                of literature in the Restoration period, the “ Lisideius ” of Dryden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay of Dramatic Poesy.</hi> He was born in 1639, the son of Sir
                John Sedley of Aylesford in Kent. Like many other men of rank and fashion at the
                court of “ the merry monarch,” Sedley had poetical ambition, and wrote comedies and
                songs. His most famous song, “ Phyllis,” is much more widely known now than the
                author’s name. His first comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Mulberry Garden, </hi>was
                published in 1668, but it does not sustain Sedley’s contemporary reputation for wit
                in conversation. He was probably too indolent to master the art of providing
                continuous opportunities for brilliant sayings, although he continued to try, wrote
                two more comedies, and left a comedy and two tragedies behind him to be published
                after his death. An indecent frolic in Bow Street, for which he was heavily fined,
                made him notorious in his youth, but later on he sobered down, entered parliament
                for New Romney (Kent), and took an active part in politics. A speech of his on the
                civil list after the Revolution is cited by Macaulay as a proof (which his plays do
                not afford) that his reputation as a man of wit and ability was deserved. His <hi
                    rend="italic">bon mot</hi> at the expense of James II. is another well-known
                fragment of his wit. The king had seduced his daughter and created her countess of
                Dorchester, whereupon Sedley remarked that he hated ingratitude, and, as the king
                had made his daughter a countess, he would endeavour to make the king’s daughter a
                queen. Sedley died on 20th August 1701.</p>
            <p>SEDUCTION. The action for seduction of an unmarried woman in England stands in a
                somewhat anomalous position. The theory of English law is that the woman herself has
                suffered no wrong ; the wrong has been suffered by the parent or person <hi
                    rend="italic">in loco parentis,</hi> who must sue for the damage arising from
                the loss of service caused by the seduction of the woman. Some evidence of service
                must be given, but very slight evidence will be sufficient. Although the action is
                nominally for loss of service, still exemplary damages may be given for the
                dishonour of the plaintiff’s family beyond recompence for the mere loss of service.
                An action for seduction cannot be brought in the county court except by agreement of
                the parties. As to seduction of a married woman, the old action for criminal
                conversation was abolished by the Divorce Act, 1857, which substituted for it a
                claim for damages against the co-respondent in a divorce suit. Seduction in England
                is not as a rule a criminal offence. But a conspiracy to seduce is indictable at
                common law. And the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885 (which extends to the United
                Kingdom), makes it felony to seduce a girl under the age of thirteen, and
                misdemeanour to seduce a girl between thirteen and sixteen (48 and 49 Vict. c. 69,
                §§ 4, 5). The same Act also deals severely with the cognate offences of procuration,
                abduction, and unlawful detention with the intent to seduce a woman of any age. In
                Scotland the seduced woman may sue on her own account.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi>In the United States State legislation has
                generally modified the common law. In some States the father brings the action as
                the representative of the family whose purity has been invaded ; in others the woman
                herself may bring the action. In many States there is a criminal as well as a civil
                remedy. The penal codes of New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, and other States make it
                a crime to seduce under promise of marriage an unmarried woman of good reputation.
