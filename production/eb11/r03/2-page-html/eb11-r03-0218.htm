<p><span class="font1">principle </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">not aiming at any assimilation of rites, but only at “ the full and perfect union of faith ” (Encyclical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Praeclara&nbsp;gratulationis</span><span class="font1"> of June 1894). This principle has even been&nbsp;carried to the extent of recognizing several bishops having&nbsp;jurisdiction over the adherents of various rites in the same see;&nbsp;thus there are three uniat patriarchs of Antioch (Graeco-Melchite, Maronite and Syrian).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Exact statistics of the membership of the Churches of the Oriental rite are almost impossible to obtain; the numbers&nbsp;of their adherents, moreover, are apt to vary suddenly with&nbsp;the shifting currents of political forces in the East, for political&nbsp;factors have always played a considerable part in these movements towards reunion or the reverse. In 1908 their numbers&nbsp;were estimated at approximately 5,500,000. The Churches&nbsp;of the Oriental rite fall under four main divisions: Greek,&nbsp;Armenian, Syrian, Coptic; and—with the exception of the&nbsp;Armenian—these are again subdivided according to nationality&nbsp;or to peculiarities of cult or language. The Churches may be&nbsp;further grouped according to the character of their constitution, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> (1) those having their own rite only in a restricted&nbsp;sense, since they have no hierarchy of their own but are subordinate to Latin bishops, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e,</span><span class="font1"> the Greeks in Italy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Italograeci),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the scattered Bulgarian Uniats, the Abyssinians, some of the&nbsp;Armenians and the “Christians of St Thomas”; (2) those&nbsp;having their own bishops and sometimes their own metropolitans, as in Austria-Hungary; (3) the Eastern patriarchates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Geographically, the Uniat Churches may be grouped as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(A) </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Europe,</span><span class="font1"> where their association with the Roman Church is at once the oldest and the most intimate. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itolograeci.</span><span class="font1"> These are distributed in scattered groups&nbsp;throughout ltaly, but are most compact in Apulia and Sicily, and&nbsp;number in all some 50,000. They are under the jurisdiction of the&nbsp;Latin diocesan bishops, but their priests are ordained by bishops&nbsp;of their own rite specially appointed by the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uniat Churches of Austria-Hungary. With the exception of the Armenian, these are all of the Greek rite, but are divided&nbsp;according to nationality and ritual language Intothefollowinggroups:&nbsp;—(a) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruthenian Church.—</span><span class="font1">This, though still the most important&nbsp;numerically of all the Uniat Churches, is but a fragment of the&nbsp;Church which proclaimed its union with Rome at the synod of&nbsp;Brest in Lithuania in 1596, a union which, after long and bitter&nbsp;resistance, was completed by the submission of the dioceses of&nbsp;Lemberg and Luzk in 1700 and 1702. The Church was broken&nbsp;up by the successive partitions of Poland, and those parts of it&nbsp;which fell to Russia were, notably under Catherine II. and Nicholas&nbsp;I., forcibly absorbed into the Orthodox Church.. The Church,&nbsp;however, still numbers some 3,000,000 adherents in Galicia, and&nbsp;500,000 in Hungary. In Galicia it has an independent organization&nbsp;under the Greek-Catholic archbishop of Lemberg, with two suffragan&nbsp;sees: Przemysl, for West Galicia, and Stanislawov for East Galicia.&nbsp;In Hungary there are two bishoprics, Munkacz and Eperies, under&nbsp;the Latin primate of Hungary, the archbishop of Gran. The Serb&nbsp;bishopric of Kreutz in Croatia, under the Latin archbishop, of&nbsp;Agram, may be also grouped with the Ruthenian Church, since&nbsp;the rite is identical. Its adherents number from 15,000 to 20,000.&nbsp;The liturgical language of the Uniat Slav Churches is Old Slavonic,&nbsp;and, so far as their rite is concerned, they differ from the Orthodox&nbsp;Slav Churches only in using the Glagolitic instead of the Cyrillic&nbsp;alphabet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ft) Rumanian Church-This</span><span class="font1"> numbers about 1,000,000&nbsp;adherents and has its own organization under the metropolitan of&nbsp;FogaVasch or Alba Jul ia<sub>;</sub> with* three suffragan sees: Lugos<sub>1</sub> Gross-Wardein and Szamoe-Uvj âr. It has had its own ritual language&nbsp;since the 17th century, (c) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armenian Church.—</span><span class="font1">This numbers in&nbsp;Austria-Hungary only some 4000 to 5000 members, lt has an&nbsp;archbishopric at Lemberg, which has jurisdiction also over the&nbsp;Uniat Armenians at Venice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniat Churches in Russia and Turkey in Europe, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;Russia the Uniat Ruthenian Church (see above) ceased to. exist&nbsp;with the incorporation* of the little Polish diocese of Chlem in the&nbsp;Orthodox Russian Church under Alexander II. in 1875. The Holy&nbsp;See, however, has never withdrawn its claim to jurisdiction over&nbsp;it, nor have the Ruthenians ever been wholly reconciled to their&nbsp;absorption in the Russian Church. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font1"> of Nicholas II.&nbsp;(Easter, 1905), granting liberty of worship, produced a movement&nbsp;in the direction of Rome; but this appears to have been, checked&nbsp;by the refusal of the government, even now, to recognize in Russia&nbsp;a Roman Catholic Church of the Greek rite. Converts to Rome&nbsp;have, therefore, to accept the Latin rite (see Prince Max of&nbsp;Saxony, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vorlesungen über aie orientalischen Kirchenfragen<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> 1907). The&nbsp;scattered communities of the Uniat Armenian Church in Russia are&nbsp;subordinate to Latin vicars apostolic. The Uniat Armenian Church&nbsp;in the Caucasus, however, is under the jurisdiction of the patri</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">archate of Cilicia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font1"> In European Turkey the Uniat Churches are represented by tiny groups, scattered about the Balkan Peninsula,&nbsp;attached to Latin ” missions.” The movement in favour of the&nbsp;union of the Bulgarian Church with Rome,, which grew up in i860,&nbsp;was the outcome of the national opposition to the Greeks, and&nbsp;with the establishment of the Bulgarian exarchate in 1872 it&nbsp;died away. There are not more, than 10,000 to 15,000 Uniat&nbsp;Bulgarians, who have been ruled since 1883 by three vicars apostolic. The Uniat Armenians and Melchites in Constantinople&nbsp;belong to the Eastern patriarchates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(B) </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Asia and Africa.</span><span class="font1">—The Uniat Churches in Asia and Africa occupy a peculiar position in so far as Rome has recognized the&nbsp;traditional rights of the patriarchates (see, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> Leo XIll.*s encyclical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Praeclara gratulationis</span><span class="font1"> of June 1894), and they therefore&nbsp;enjoy almost complete autonomy; thus the patriarchs nominate&nbsp;their own suffragans and have the right to summon synods for&nbsp;specific purposes (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Patriarch).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are six Uniat Patriarchates :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Patriarchatus . Ciliciae Arrnenorurn.</span><span class="font1"> The Armenian&nbsp;patriarch, whose jurisdiction embraces the Catholic Armenians&nbsp;in the Balkan Peninsula, in Russian Armenia and in Asiatic Turkey,&nbsp;formerly resided in Lebanon, but has had his seat since 1867 at&nbsp;Constantinople. Under him are 19 dioceses, including a small&nbsp;one in Persia. The number of Catholic Armenians under his jurisdiction is, roughly, 100,000 (sec </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Armenian Church).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three patriarchates of Antioch, (a) The Melchite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CPatri-archatus Antiochcnus Graeco-Melchitarum).</span><span class="font1"> The patriarch resides&nbsp;in the monastery of Ain-Traz in the Lebanon ana has jurisdiction&nbsp;over all the Uniats of Greek nationality in the Turkish Empire, who&nbsp;number about 120,000. Under him are 3 archbishops and 9 bishops&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Melchites).</span><span class="font1"> (&amp;) The Maronites </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CPatriarchatus Antiochenus&nbsp;Syro-Maronitarum),</span><span class="font1"> whose seat is in the Lebanon. The patriarch has jurisdiction over about 500,000 people (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Maronites).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font1"> The Syrian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Patriarchatus Antiochenus Syrorum).</span><span class="font1"> The patriarch,&nbsp;who resides at Mardin near Diarbekr on the upper Tigris, is obeyed&nbsp;by from 15,000 to 20,000 people, who represent a secession from the&nbsp;Jacobite Church (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jacobite Church).</span><span class="font1"> He has 3 archbishoprics&nbsp;and 5 bishoprics under his jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chaldaeans </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Patriarchatus Chaldaeorum Babylonensis).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The patriarch has jurisdiction over the Uniat Nestorian Church,&nbsp;which numbers, roughly, about 50,000 adherents, and is divided,&nbsp;under the patriarch, into 11 dioceses (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nestorians).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coptic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Patriarchotus Alexandrinus Coptorum).</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;was founded on the 26th of November 1895 by Pope Leo XlIl.&nbsp;The patriarch, who was given two suffragan bishops, has his seat&nbsp;at Cairo. The number of Uniat Copts is nominal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uniat Abyssinian Church. This has scaracely any adherents. Such as there are are under the authority of a vicar&nbsp;apostolic residing at Keren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christians of St Thomas (Malabar coast). For these&nbsp;Leo XIII. established in 1887 three special vicariates apostolic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CVicoriotus Opostolici Syro-Malabarorum) ; </span><span class="font1">the vicars apostolic&nbsp;are Latins, but have the right to pontificate and to confirm according to the Syrian rite. The number of Christians of St Thomas in&nbsp;the obedience of Rome is said to be about 100,ooo.@@<sup>1</sup>· (W. A. P.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Church in Europe since the Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “ Romish Catholique ” is as old as the days of Queen Elizabeth.@@<sup>2</sup> It is not happily chosen, for catholic&nbsp;means universal, and what is universal cannot be peculiar to&nbsp;Rome. But the term is inoffensive to Roman Catholics, since&nbsp;it advertises their claim that communion with the see of Rome&nbsp;is of the essence of Catholicity, and to Protestants, since it&nbsp;serves to emphasize the fact that the religion of modern Rome&nbsp;differs widely in many important respects from that of the&nbsp;undivided medieval Church. The change has brought both&nbsp;good and evil. Protestant controversialists have some show&nbsp;of reason on their side when they argue that Luther saved the&nbsp;Roman Church by forcing it to put an end to many intolerable&nbsp;abuses. On the other hand, under stress of his revolt the&nbsp;papacy could not but develop in a strongly anti-Protestant&nbsp;direction, laying exaggerated emphasis on every point he&nbsp;challenged. The more fiercely he denounced 'infallibility, the&nbsp;confessional, the sacramental system, the larger these things&nbsp;bulked in the eyes of Rome.</span></p>
