<p><label>REVENGE</label>, means the return of injury for injury and differs materially from that ſudden reſentmertt which ,rifes in the mind immediately on being injured ; which, fo far ſrom being culpable when reſtrained within due bounds, is abfolutely neceſſary for felf-preſervation. Revenge, on the contrary, is a cool and deliberate wicked-neſs, and is often executed years after the offence was given ; and the defire of it is generally the effect of littleneſs, weakneſs, and vice ; while, to do right, and to fnffer wrong, is an argument of a great ſoul, that ſcorns to ſtoop to ſuggeſted revenges.</p><p>Revenge is but a frailty incident</p><p>To craz’d and fickly minds ; the poor content</p><p>of little fouls, unable to ſurmount</p><p>An injury, too weak to bear affront. <hi rend="italic">Dryden.</hi></p><p>Revenge is generally the concomitant of ſavage minds, of minds implacable, and capable of the moſt horrid barbarities ; unable to fet any limits to their dif-pleafure, they can confine their anger within no bounds of reaſon.</p><p>Cruel revenge, which ſtill we find</p><p>The wcakeſt frailty of a feeble mind.</p><p>Degenerous paſſion, and for man too bafe,</p><p>It ſeats its empire in the favage race.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Juvenal.</hi></p><p>The inſtitution of law prevents the execution of private revenge, and the growth of civilization ſhows its impropriety. Though in modern times a ſpecies of revenge is ſanctioned by what is called the law of honour, which evades the law of the land indeed, but which is equally mean and diſgraceful as the other kinds, and is of conſequences equally baneful.
