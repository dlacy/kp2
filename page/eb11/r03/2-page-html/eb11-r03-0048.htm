        <p><span class="font1">back-sight on an ivory pyramid with two or three leaves up to 300
                yds., and the enamelled bead fore-sight, are the most usual&nbsp;form. The more
                elaborate Lyman and Beech peep-sights are&nbsp;also popular. One or two varieties of
                telescope sight, attachable&nbsp;to the barrel, are also made by some leading
                gunmakers, and&nbsp;have been used with success in the field. Solid-drawn
                brass&nbsp;cartridge-cases are now always used for sporting rifles,
                except&nbsp;occasionally for some of the larger bores, in which paper cartridges may
                be used. The peculiarity of the express bullet&nbsp;is its hollow point, which is
                intended to ensure the expansion&nbsp;of the projectile on impact. This diminishes
                its penetration,&nbsp;but translates its velocity or energy into “ shock.” If
                greater&nbsp;penetration is needed, the leaden bullet is hardened with
                mercury&nbsp;or tin, or the military nickel-coated bullet is used.
                Explosive&nbsp;bullets filled with detonating powder were at one time used
                in&nbsp;express and large-bore rifles for large game. These are now&nbsp;practically
                abandoned, owing to their uncertainty of action and&nbsp;the danger in handling
                them. The use of the large 4- and&nbsp;8-bore black-powder rifles is restricted to
                the hunting of large&nbsp;and dangerous game. These are usually
                double-barrelled.&nbsp;The 4-hore weighs from 14 to 18 Ib with 20-in. barrels,
                and&nbsp;fires a charge of 12 to 14 drs. of powder, with a spherical bullet&nbsp;of
                1510 grs. The great weight of this rifle is against its&nbsp;general use. The 8-bore
                rifle weighs from nJ to 15 Ib with&nbsp;20- to 24-in. barrels, with a charge of 8 to
                12 drs. of powder&nbsp;with a spherical ball. These rifles are accurate and
                effective&nbsp;up to 120 yds. Rook and rabbit rifles are usually single-barrel
                breech-loading rifles of from 220 yards to 380 bore, hammerless, ejectectors. The
                range is ordinarily restricted to 200 yds.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Combined rifles and shot-guns are generally used in countries where
                the kind of game to be met with is not known beforehand,&nbsp;and by emigrants who
                can only afford one gun. These weapons&nbsp;are double-barrelled (450 rifle barrel
                and 16-bore short&nbsp;harrel; or 500 rifle and 12-bore shot). Such a gun
                has&nbsp;many drawbacks, being too heavy for a shot-gun and too light&nbsp;for a
                rifle, with a bad balance. More modern combinations&nbsp;of the rifle and shot-gun
                are Holland’s “ Paradox,” a smooth&nbsp;bore with the last three inches of the
                barrel ratchet-rifled,&nbsp;Lancaster’s “ Colindian ” twisted oval bore, and
                Bland’s&nbsp;“ Eùôplia ” with “ invisible ” undulating rifling. All
                these&nbsp;weapons fire heavy bullets more or less accurately up to&nbsp;100 yds.,
                are also used as shot-guns, and are made double-or single-barrelled and of various
                calibres, 12-bore being the&nbsp;most common. There is also Greener’s “ under and
                over,”&nbsp;the rifle barrel being topmost (usually 16-bore shot-gun barrel&nbsp;and
                450 rifle barrel). The Morris tube also enables a shot-gun&nbsp;to be utilized as a
                small-bore rifle or a large rifle as a saloon&nbsp;rifle for gallery practice. The
                automatic principle has not yet&nbsp;been applied to sporting rifles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miniature Rifles.—</span><span
                class="font1">In 1905 a War Office miniature or cadet rifle for instruction purposes
                was officially adopted by the British&nbsp;military authorities. The details of this
                rifle were determined&nbsp;by a committee, upon which the National Rifle Association
                and&nbsp;the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs were represented. It is
                a&nbsp;single-loading bolt-action rifle of 22 calibre, with military&nbsp;sights
                (the aperture sight being barred), shooting a rim-fire&nbsp;cartridge having a
                40-gr. bullet propelled by 5 grs. of black&nbsp;gunpowder or its equivalent in some
                smokeless explosive. It&nbsp;is used at ranges from 25 yds. up to a maximum of 200
                yds.&nbsp;The official adoption of such a rifle was largely due to the&nbsp;civilian
                rifle club movement, which was the outcome of the South&nbsp;African War, and in
                which the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs&nbsp;has played an important part. Until
                the recent official adoption&nbsp;of the miniature rifle, the council of the N.R.A.
                regarded&nbsp;marksmanship with the service rifle as its main object of
                encouragement, and the service rifle itself as the orthodox weapon.&nbsp;The Society
                of Miniature Rifle Clubs, on the other hand, makes&nbsp;the encouragement of the use
                of low-power rifles its special&nbsp;object, with few restrictions as to type of
                sights, rifle or ammunition. Numerous civilian rifle clubs have adopted the 22
                calibre&nbsp;rifle, in many cases with aperture sights, with marked
                success,&nbsp;and British rifle-makers were encouraged to cater for this
            new</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">demand for low-power rifles. Such weapons can be far more widely and
                generally used than the ordinary service weapon,&nbsp;owing to their smaller cost,
                cheaper ammunition, absence of&nbsp;recoil, and their convenience for use at short
                covered ranges&nbsp;in crowded centres of population. In many parts of
                Great&nbsp;Britain there is practically no alternative between
                low-power&nbsp;short-range practice and no shooting at all. The N.R.A. has&nbsp;now
                admitted the miniature *22 calibre rifle upon equal terms&nbsp;with the service
                rifle. The miniature rifle has, to some extent,&nbsp;taken the place of the Morris
                tube and “ adaptors ” previously&nbsp;used for rifle practice at short
                    ranges.@@<sup>1</sup> The Morris, tube consists&nbsp;of a small-rifled barrel,
                usually chambered for the 297/230-bore&nbsp;cartridge, and capable of being fitted
                inside the barrel of the&nbsp;ordinary service weapon, which thus becomes available
                as a&nbsp;miniature rifle for short-range practice. The Morris tube has&nbsp;been
                adopted by the British War Ofike, and affords an excellent&nbsp;means of training
                the recruit. “ Adaptors ” are dummy&nbsp;cartridge-cases fitted into the breech of
                the ordinary rifle, by&nbsp;means of which a shorter cartridge firing a lighter
                charge of&nbsp;powder, but with a bullet of the same calibre as the rifle,
                can&nbsp;be used for short-range practice. One of the first English&nbsp;miniature
                target rifles was the “ Sharpshooters’ Club ” rifle,,&nbsp;on the Martini principle,
                of -310 calibre, manufactured and&nbsp;introduced by W. W. Greener, and suitable for
                ranges from&nbsp;50 to 300 yds. This rifle was adopted by many rifle clubs,
                and&nbsp;in 1901 established a record in the miniature rifle competition&nbsp;at
                Bisley. Miniature rifle shooting has been much encouraged&nbsp;throughout the United
                Kingdom by the establishment of tho&nbsp;Light Rifle Championship competition under
                the auspices of&nbsp;the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs. In 1907 Queen
                Alexandra,&nbsp;presented a cup for this event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

                might be traced to the hanging pelisse&nbsp;and the jacket formerly worn by the
                members of those corps.&nbsp;The cock bird is clothed in velvety-black generally
                glossed with&nbsp;rich purple, but having each feather of the abdomen
                broadly&nbsp;tipped with a chevron of green bronze, while the crown of the&nbsp;head
                is covered with scale-like feathers of glittering green, and&nbsp;on the throat
