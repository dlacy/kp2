In the year 1710 was commenced the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> of which Swift wrote 33 papers, beginning his firſt part of it on the 10th of November 1711. The next year he publiſhed <hi rend="italic">the Conduct of the Allies</hi> ten days before the parliament aſſembled ; and ſoon afterwards, <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the barrier Treaty.</hi> The purpoſe of theſe pamphlets was to perſuade the nation to a peace, by ſhowing that " mines had been exhauſted and millions deſtroyed” to ſecure the Dutch and aggrandize the emperor, without any advantage whatever to Great Britain. Though theſe two publications, together with his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Biſhop of Sarum's Introduction to the third Volume of his History of the Reformation,</hi> certainly turned the tide of popular opinion, and effectually promoted the deſigns of the miniſtry, the beſt preferment which his friends could venture to give him was the deanery of St Patrick’s, which he accepted in 1713. In the midſt of his power and his politics he kept a journal of his viſits, his walks, his interviews with miniſters, and quarrels with his servant, and tranſmitted it to Mrs Johnſon and Mrs Dingley, to whom he knew that whatever befel him was intereſting ; but in 1714 an end was put to his power by the death of the queen, which broke down at once the whole ſyſtem of Tory politics, and nothing remained for him but to withdraw from perſecution to his deanery.</p><p>In the triumph of the Whigs, Swift met with every mortification that a ſpirit like his could poſſibly be expoſed to. The people of Ireland were irritated againſt him beyond meaſure ; and every indignity was offered him as he walked the ſtreets of Dublin. Nor was he only inſulted by the rabble, but perſons of diſtiguiſhed rank and character forgot the decorum of common civility to give him a perſonal affront. While his pride was hurt by ſuch indignities, his more tender feelings were alſo often wounded by Safe ingratitude. In ſuch a ſituation he found it in vain to ſtruggle againſt the tide that oppoſed him. He ſilently yielded to it, and retired from the world to diſcharge his duties as a clergyman, and attend to the care of his deanery. That no part of his time might lie heavy on his hands, he employed his leiſure hours on ſome hiſtorical attempts relating to the change of the miniſters and the conduct of the miniſtry ; and completed the hiſtory of the four laſt years of the queen, which had been begun in her lifetime, but which he never publiſhed. Of the work which bears that title, and is ſaid to be his, Dr Johnſon doubts the genuineneſs ; and it certainly is not ſuch as we ſhould have expected from a man of Swift’s fagacity and opportunities of information.</p><p>In the year 1716 he was privately married to Mrs Johnson by Dr Aſhe biſhop of Clogher ; but the marriage made no change in their ſituation, and it would be difficult to prove (says Lord Orrery) that they were ever afterwards together but in the preſence of a third perſon. The dean of St Patrick’s lived in a private manner, known and regarded only by his friends, till about the year 1720 that he publiſhed his firſt political pamphlet relative to Ireland, intitled <hi rend="italic">A Propoſal for the Universal Uſe of Iriſh Manufactures ;</hi> which ſo rouſed the indignation of the miniſtry that they commenced a proſecution againſt the printer, which drew the attention of the public to the pamphlet, and at once made its author popular.</p><p>Whilſt he was enjoying the laurels which this work had wreathed for him, his felicity, as well as that of his wife, was interrupted by the death of Mrs Van Homrigh, and the publication of his poem called <hi rend="italic">Cadenus and Vanessa,</hi> which brought upon him much merited obloquy. With Mrs Van Homrigh he became acquainted in London during his attendance at court ; and finding her possessed of genius and fond of literature, he took delight in directing her ſtudies, till he got inſensibly poſſeſſion of her heart. From being proud of his praiſe, ſhe grew fond of his perſon ; and deſpising vulgar reſtraints, ſhe made him ſensible that ſhe was ready to receive him as a husband. She had wit, youth, beauty, and a competent fortune to recommend her ; and for a while Swift ſeems to have been undetermined whether or not he ſhould comply with her wiſh. She had followed him to Ireland, where ſhe lived in a houſe about twelve miles diſtant from Dublin ; and he continued to visit her occasionally, and to direct her ſtudies as he had done in London ; but with theſe attentions ſhe was not ſatisfied, and at laſt ſent to him a letter written with great ardour and tenderness, inſiſting that he ſhould immediately accept or refuſe her as a wife. His anſwer, which probably contained the ſecret of his marriage, he carried himſelf ; and having indignantly thrown it on the lady’s table, inſtantly quitted the houſe, we believe without ſpeaking to her, and returned to Dublin to reflect on the conſequences of his own conduct. Theſe were dreadful. Mrs Van Homrigh ſurvived her diſappointment but a few weeks ; during which time ſhe cancelled a will that ſhe had made in his favour, and ordered the poem to be publiſhed in which Cadenus had proclaimed her excellence and confeſſed his love.</p><p>His patriotiſm again burſt forth in 1724 to obſtruct the currency of Wood’s halfpence ; and his zeal was crowned with ſucceſs. Wood had obtained a patent to coin 180,000 l. in halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of Ireland ; and was about to turn his braſs into gold, when Swift, finding that the metal was debaſed to an enormous degree, wrote letters under the name of <hi rend="italic">Μ. B. Drapier</hi> to ſhow the folly of giving gold and ſilver for coin not worth a third part of its nominal value. A proſecution was carried on againſt the printer; and lord Carteret, then lord lieutenant, iſſued a proclamation, offering L.300 for diſcovering the author of the fourth letter. The day after it was publiſhed there was a full levee at the caſtle. The lord-lieutenant was going round the circle, when Swift abruptly entered the chamber, and puſhing his way through the crowd, never stopped till he got within the circle; where, with marks of the higheſt indignation in his countenance, he addreſſed the lord-lieutenant with the voice of a Stentor, that re-echoed through the room, “ So, my lord lieutenant, this is a glorious exploit that you performed yeſterday, in iſſuing a proclamation againſt a poor ſhop-keeper, whoſe only crime is an honeſt endeavour to ſave his country from ruin. You have given a noble ſpecimen of what this devoted nation is to hope for from your government. I ſuppoſe you expect a ſtatue of copper will be erected to you for this ſervice done to Wood.” He then went on for a long time, inveighing in the bittereſt terms againſt the patent, and diſplaying in the ſtrongeſt colours all the fatal conſequences of introducing that execrable coin. The whole aſſembly were ſtruck mute with wonder at this unprecedented ſcene. For ſome time a profound ſilence enſued. When lord Carteret, who had liſtened with great compoſure to the whole speech, made this fine reply, in a line of Virgil’s :</p><p><hi rend="italic">Res dura,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">regni novitas me talia cogunt Moliri.</hi></p><p>From this time Swift was known by the name of <hi rend="italic">the Dean, a</hi>nd was known by the populace as the champion, patron, and inſtructor of Ireland.</p><p>In 1727 he returned to England; where, in conjunction with Pope, he collected three volumes of miscellanies ; and the ſame year he ſent into the world his <hi rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels, </hi>a production which was read by the high and the low, and filled every reader with a mingled emotion of merriment and amazement. Whilſt he was enjoying the reputation of this work, he was ſuddenly called to a home oſ ſorrow. Poor Stella was sinking into the grave ; and after a languiſhing</p></body></text></TEI>
