<p><span class="font3">ROSSWEIN, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Saxony, situated on the Freiberger Mulde, 46 m. S.E. from Leipzig by&nbsp;the railway via Döbeln to Dresden. Pop. (1905). 9297. It&nbsp;is famous for its technical schools, among which are one for&nbsp;builders, another for furniture-makers, and a third for ironmongers. The industries are considerable, and include woollen&nbsp;and cloth manufactures, dyeing, spinning, and the making of&nbsp;agricultural machinery, cigars, chemicals, bricks and iron&nbsp;goods. Rosswein is an old town, cloth-making being a flourishing industry here in the 14th century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSTAND, EDMOND (1869- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">), French dramatist, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">born on the ist of April 1869, the son of Joseph Eugène Herbert Rostand (b. 1843), a prominent journalist and economist of&nbsp;Marseilles. His first play, a burlesque, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Les romanesques,</span><span class="font3"> was&nbsp;produced on the 21st of May 1894 at the Théâtre Français.&nbsp;He’took the motive of his second piece, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">La Princesse lointaine&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(Théâtre de la Renaissance, 5th April 1895), from the story of&nbsp;the troubadour Rudel and the Lady of Tripoli. The part of&nbsp;Mélissande was created by Sarah Bernhardt, who also was the&nbsp;original Photine of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">La Samaritaine</span><span class="font3"> (Théâtre de la Renaissance,&nbsp;14th April 1897), a Biblical drama in three scenes taken from&nbsp;the gospel story of the woman of Samaria. The production of&nbsp;his “ heroic comedy ” of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cyrano de Bergerac</span><span class="font3"> (28th December&nbsp;1807, Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin), with Coquelin in the&nbsp;title-rôle, was a triumph. No such enthusiasm for a drama in&nbsp;verse had been known since the days of Hugo's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hernani.</span><span class="font3"> The&nbsp;play was quickly translated into English, German, Russian and&nbsp;other European languages. For his hero he had drawn on&nbsp;French 17th-century history; in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">U Aiglon</span><span class="font3"> he chose a subject&nbsp;from Napoleoqjc legend, suggested probably by Henri Welsch-inger’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roi de Rome, 1811-32</span><span class="font3"> (1897), which contained much&nbsp;new information about the unhappy life of the duke of Reichstadt, son of Napoleon I. and Marie Louise, under the surveillance of Metternich at the palace of Schönbrunn. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L'Aiglon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">in six acts and in verse, was produced (15th March 1900) by&nbsp;Sarah Bernhardt at her own theatre, she herself undertaking&nbsp;the part of the duke of Reichstadt. In 1902 Rostand was&nbsp;elected to the French Academy. His </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Chantecler,</span><span class="font3"> produced in&nbsp;February 1910, was awaited with an interest (enhanced by considerable delay in the production) hardly equalled by the&nbsp;enthusiasm of its reception. Lucien Guitry was in the title-rôle and Mme. Simone played the part of the pheasant, the&nbsp;play being a fantasy of bird and animal life, and the characters denizens of the farmyard and the woods. Rostand’s wife,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">née</span><span class="font3"> Rosemonde Êtienette Gérard, published in 1890 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Les Pipeaux,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">a volume of verse crowned by the Academy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ROSTOCK, a town of Germany, in the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, one of the most important commercial cities on the Baltic. It is situated on the left bank of the estuary of&nbsp;the Warnow, 8 m. from the port of Warnemünde on the Baltic.&nbsp;177 m. N.W. of Berlin by rail, 80 m. N.E. of Lübeck, and 106 m.&nbsp;S. of Copenhagen. Pop. (1905) 60,790. It consists of three&nbsp;parts—the old town to the east, and the middle and new towns&nbsp;to the west—of which the first retains some of the antique&nbsp;features of a Hanse town, while the last two are for the most&nbsp;part regularly and handsomely built. There are also several&nbsp;suburbs. The town has four gates, one of them dating from&nbsp;the 14th century, and some fine squares, among them the&nbsp;Blücher Platz, with a statue of Blücher, who was born here,&nbsp;and the Neue Markt. Rostock was a fortress of some strength,&nbsp;but the old fortifications have been razed, and their site is&nbsp;occupied by promenades. Rostock has five old churches:&nbsp;St Mary’s, dating from 1398 to 1472, one of the most imposing&nbsp;Gothic buildings in Mecklenburg, with two Romanesque towers&nbsp;and containing a magnificent bronze font and a curious clock;&nbsp;St Nicholas’s, begun about 1250 and restored in 1450, and again&nbsp;in 1890-94; St Peter’s, with a lofty tower over 400 ft. high,&nbsp;built in 1400, which serves as a landmark to ships at sea;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St James’s, completed in 1588, and the church of the Holy Rood, begun in 1270. St Mary’s church contains a monument marking&nbsp;the original tomb of Hugo Grotius, who died in Rostock in 1645,&nbsp;though his remains were afterwards removed to Delft. Among&nbsp;other interesting buildings are the curious 14th-century Gothic&nbsp;town hall, the façade of which is concealed by a Renaissance&nbsp;addition; the palace of the grand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,&nbsp;built in 1702; the law courts, built in 1878-79; the university&nbsp;buildings, erected in 1867-70; and an assembly hall of the&nbsp;estates of Mecklenburg (Ständehaus), a handsome Gothic&nbsp;building erected in 1889-93.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The university of Rostock was founded in 1418 by Dukes Johann III. and Albrecht V. of Mecklenburg. From 1437 till 1443&nbsp;it had its seat at Greifswald in. consequence of commotions at&nbsp;Rostock; and in 1760 it was again removed, on this occasion to&nbsp;Bützow. The professors appointed by the city, however, still&nbsp;taught at Rostock, so that there were practically two universities&nbsp;in the duchy until 1789, when they were reunited at the original&nbsp;seat. Rostock is the seat of the supreme court for both the duchies&nbsp;of Mecklenburg, and is well equipped with schools, hospitals, and&nbsp;other institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although the population, commerce and wealth of Rostock have declined since .Hanse days, it has a considerable, trade, being the&nbsp;chief commercial town of Mecklenburg and owning a considerable&nbsp;fleet. Vessels drawing 16 ft. of water are able to get uç to the&nbsp;wharves. By far the most important export is grain, which goes&nbsp;almost entirely to British ports; but wool, flax and cattle are also&nbsp;shipped. The chief imports are coal from Great Britain, herrings&nbsp;from Sweden, petroleum, from America, timber, wine and colonial&nbsp;goods. Rostock has an important fair at Whitsuntide, lasting for&nbsp;Fourteen days, and also a frequented wool and cattle market. The&nbsp;industries of the town are varied. One </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font3">the chief is shipbuilding.&nbsp;Machinery, chemicals, sugar, malt, paper, musical instruments,&nbsp;cotton, straw hats, tobacco, carpets, soap, playing cards, chocolate&nbsp;and dye-stuffs are among the manufactures. The town also contains&nbsp;distilleries, saw-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, breweries and electrical&nbsp;works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Local historians assert that a village existed on the site of Rostock as early as </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 329, but no certain proofs have been&nbsp;traced of any earlier community than that founded here in&nbsp;the 12th century, which is said to have received municipal&nbsp;rights in 1218. The earliest signs of commercial prosperity&nbsp;date from about 1260. For a time Rostock was under the&nbsp;dominion of the kings of Denmark. Soon after returning under&nbsp;the protection of Mecklenburg in the 14th century it joined the&nbsp;Hanseatic League; and was one of the original members of the&nbsp;powerful Wendish Hansa, in which it exercised an influence&nbsp;second only to that of Lübeck. The most prosperous epoch of&nbsp;its commercial history began in the latter half of the 15th&nbsp;century, precisely at the period when its political power began&nbsp;to wane. Rostock, however, never entirely lost the independence which it enjoyed as a Hanse town; and in 1788, as the&nbsp;result of long contentions with the rulers of Mecklenburg, it&nbsp;secured for itself a peculiar and liberal municipal constitution,&nbsp;administered by three burgomasters and three chambers. In&nbsp;1880 this constitution was somewhat modified, and the city&nbsp;became less like a state within a state. It has belonged to&nbsp;Mecklenburg-Schwerin since 1695; in 1712 it was taken by&nbsp;the Swedes, in 1715 by the Danes and in 1716 by the Russians.&nbsp;The badge of Rostock is the figure 7; and a local rhyme explains that there are 7 doors to St Mary’s church, 7 streets from&nbsp;the market-place, 7 gates on the landward side and 7 wharves&nbsp;on the seaward side of the town, 7 turrets on the town-hall,&nbsp;which has 7 bells, and 7 linden trees in the park.</span></p>
