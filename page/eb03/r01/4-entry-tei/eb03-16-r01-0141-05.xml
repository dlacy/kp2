                <p><label>RETIREMENT</label>, means a private way of life or a fecret habitation. “
                    Few (lays an elegant writer) are able to bear ſolitude ; and though retirement
                    is the of-tenſible object of the greater part, yet, when they are enabled by
                    ſucceſs to retire, they feel themſelves unhappy. Peculiar powers and elegance of
                    mind are neceffary to enable us to draw all our reſources from our-felves. In a
                    remote and folitary village the mind muſt be internally active in a great
                    degree, or it will be mi-ferable for want of employment. But in great and
                    populous cities, even while it is paſſive, it will be con-ſtantly amufed. It is
                    impoffible to walk the ſtreets without finding the attention powerfully
                    folicited on every fide. . No exertion is neceffary. objects pour themfelves
                    into the fenfes, and it would be difficult to prevent their admittance. But, in,
                    retirement, there wuſt be a ſpirit of philoſophy and a ſtore of learning, or
                    elfe the fancied feenes of bliſs will vaniſli like the colours of the rainbow.
                    Poor Cowley might be laid to be melancholy mad. He languiſhed ſor ſohtude, and
                    wiſhed to hide himfelf in the wilds of America. But, alas ! he was not able to
                    ſupport the ſolitude of a coun-try village within a few miles of the metropolis
                    !</p>
                <p>“With a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few faithful and good-humoured
                    friends, with a well-selected collection of elegant books, and with a
                    competency, one may enjoy comforts even in the deserted village, which the city,
                    with all its diverfions, cannot supply.”</p>
