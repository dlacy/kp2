The word appears to be derived from a shortened form of “ scamper,” to run away, decamp, to move quickly or nimbly; which is generally taken to be a military slang word</p><p>adapted from Dutch <hi rend="italic">schampen,</hi> to escape; O.Fr. <hi rend="italic">escamper;</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">scampare·,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">ex,</hi> out of, <hi rend="italic">campus,</hi> field of battle, hence a vagabond deserter. This word must be distinguished from “ scamp,” to do work in a hasty, careless manner, which is apparently a variant of “ skimp,” “ skimpy,” and is to be referred to the root seen in O. Nor. <hi rend="italic">skammr,</hi> short; Eng. “ scant.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
