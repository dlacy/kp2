<p><span class="font1">RYDE, a municipal borough and watering place of the Isle of Wight, is finely situated on a sloping eminence&nbsp;above the Solent, 5 miles south by west of Portsmouth,&nbsp;and 7 (12 by rail) from West Cowes. It occupies the site&nbsp;of a village called La Rye or La Riche, which was destroyed&nbsp;by the French in the reign of Edward II. About the close&nbsp;of the 18th century it was a small fishing hamlet; but&nbsp;when the beauty of its site attracted attention it rapidly&nbsp;grew into favour as a watering-place. The streets are&nbsp;wide, regular, and well-paved, and there are a large number&nbsp;of fine villas on the slopes of the hill. It is connected&nbsp;by rail with the principal other towns in the island, and&nbsp;there is also steamboat communication with Portsmouth,&nbsp;Southampton, Southsea, Portsea, and Stoke’s Bay. The&nbsp;pier, built originally in 1812, but since then greatly extended, forms a delightful promenade half a mile in length.&nbsp;The principal buildings are All Saints church, erected in&nbsp;1870 from the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, and other&nbsp;churches, the market-house and town hall, the Royal Victoria Yacht club-house, the theatre, and the Royal Isle of&nbsp;AVight Infirmary. The town was incorporated in 1868,&nbsp;and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen&nbsp;councillors. The population of the municipal borough (area&nbsp;792 acres) in 1871 was 11,260 and in 1881 it was 11,461.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYE. As in the case of other cereals, it is doubtful if rye </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Secale cereale)</span><span class="font1"> exists at the present time in a truly&nbsp;wild state. The best evidence on this point goes to&nbsp;show that the plant is a native of the regions between&nbsp;the Black and Caspian Seas. It is also recorded from&nbsp;Afghanistan and Turkestan ; but botanists are very chary&nbsp;about admitting the validity of the evidence hitherto&nbsp;adduced. Aitchison, the latest investigator of the flora of&nbsp;Afghanistan, mentions it as growing in wheat-fields, where&nbsp;it is considered as a weed, not being intentionally sown. In&nbsp;some fields “it almost eradicates the wheat crop.” But&nbsp;this merely shows that the conditions are more favourable&nbsp;to the growth of rye than to that of wheat. In spite of&nbsp;the uncertainty as to the precise origin of the cultivated&nbsp;plant, its cultivation does not appear to have been practised&nbsp;at a very early date, relatively speaking. Alphonse de&nbsp;Candolle, who has collected the evidence on this point,&nbsp;draws attention to the fact that no traces of this cereal&nbsp;have hitherto been found in Egyptian monuments or in&nbsp;the earlier Swiss dwellings, though seeds have been found&nbsp;in association with weapons of the Bronze period at</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Olmiitz. The absence of any special name for it in the Semitic, Chinese, and Sanskrit languages is also adduced&nbsp;as an indication of its comparatively recent culture. On&nbsp;the other hand, the general occurrence of the name in the&nbsp;more modern languages of northern Europe, under various&nbsp;modifications, points to the cultivation of the plant then,&nbsp;as now, in those regions. The origin of the Latin name&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">secale,</span><span class="font1"> which exists in a modified form among the Basques&nbsp;and Bretons, is not explained. The circumstances that the&nbsp;cultivation of rye is relatively not of great antiquity and&nbsp;that it is confined to a relatively restricted area must be&nbsp;taken into account, in connexion with the fact that the&nbsp;variations of this cereal are much fewer than are noted in&nbsp;the case of other plants of like character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fact stated by Müller that the anthers and stigmas of the flowers come to maturity at the same time would&nbsp;tend to “ close fertilization ” and a consequent constancy of&nbsp;“characters” in the offspring, and, as a matter of fact,&nbsp;the varieties of this grass are not numerous. Rye is a&nbsp;tall-growing annual grass, with fibrous roots, flat, narrow,&nbsp;ribbon-like bluish-green leaves, and erect or decurved&nbsp;cylindrical slender spikes like those of barley. The spikelets contain two or three flowers, of which the uppermost&nbsp;is usually imperfect. The outer glumes are acute glabrous,&nbsp;the flowering glumes lance-shaped, with a comb-like keel&nbsp;at the back, and the outer or lower one prolonged at the&nbsp;apex into a very long bristly awn. AVithin these are three&nbsp;stamens surrounding a compressed ovary, with two feathery&nbsp;stigmas. AA<sup>τ</sup>hen ripe, the grain is of an elongated oval&nbsp;form, with a few hairs at the summit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the southern parts of Great Britain rye is chiefly or solely cultivated as a forage-plant for cattle and horses,&nbsp;being usually sown in autumn for spring use, after the&nbsp;crop of roots, turnips, &amp;c., is exhausted, and before the&nbsp;clover and lucerne are ready. For forage purposes it is&nbsp;best to cut early, before the leaves and haulms have been&nbsp;exhausted of their supplies to benefit the grain. In the&nbsp;northern parts of Europe, and more especially in Scandinavia, Russia, and parts of northern Germany, rye is the&nbsp;principal cereal ; and in nutritive value, as measured by the&nbsp;amount of gluten it contains, it stands next to wheat, a&nbsp;fact which furnishes the explanation of its culture in&nbsp;northern latitudes ill-suited for the growth of wheat. Rye-bread or black-bread is in general use in northern Europe,&nbsp;but finds little favour with those unaccustomed to its use,&nbsp;owing to its sour taste, the sugar it contains rapidly&nbsp;passing into the acetous fermentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the ovaries of the plant become affected with a peculiar fungus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cordyceps),</span><span class="font1"> they become blackened and&nbsp;distorted, constituting Ergot </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.ν.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYE, a municipal town and seaport at the eastern extremity of the county of Sussex, 63 miles south-southeast of London, is built upon a rocky eminence which two&nbsp;or three centuries ago was washed on all sides by the&nbsp;influx of the tide, but now, in consequence of the gradual&nbsp;recession of the sea, lies two miles inland. It is surrounded by rich marsh land through which flows the river&nbsp;Rother, uniting at the south-east foot of the rock with&nbsp;two rivulets to form a small serpentine estuary, Rye&nbsp;harbour, the mouth of which is connected with the town&nbsp;by means of a branch line of railway. In bygone years,&nbsp;when the adjacent marshes were flooded with tidal water,&nbsp;the efflux was so powerful as to effectually maintain safe&nbsp;and free entrance into Rye harbour ; and in the reign of&nbsp;Charles II. a frigate of 50 guns could enter and ride at&nbsp;anchor. Now the harbour suffers seriously from the&nbsp;shifting sand and shingle, and considerable sums of money&nbsp;have been expended by the harbour commissioners with&nbsp;the view of overcoming these impediments, with but&nbsp;partial success. The trade is chiefly in coal, timber,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
