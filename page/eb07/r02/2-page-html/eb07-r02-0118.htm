<p><span class="font0">she told what had befallen her, required of them the pledge of their right hands that they would avenge her injuries,&nbsp;then drawing a knife from under her robe, stabbed herself&nbsp;to the heart and died. Her husband and father burst into&nbsp;a loud cry of agony ; but Brutus snatching the weapon from&nbsp;the wound, held it up, and swore by the chaste and noble&nbsp;blood which stained it, that he would pursue to the uttermost&nbsp;Tarquinius and all his accursed race, and thenceforward&nbsp;suffer no man to be king in Rome. He then gave the bloody&nbsp;knife to her husband, her father, and Valerius, and called&nbsp;on them to take the same oath. Brutus thus became at&nbsp;once the leader of the enterprise. They bore the body&nbsp;of Lucretia to the market place. There Brutus addressed the&nbsp;people, and moved them to vengeance. The youth immediately enrolled themselves into an army. Part remained to guard the city, and part proceeded with Brutus to&nbsp;Rome. Their coming raised a tumult, and drew together&nbsp;great numbers of the citizens. Brutus, availing himself of&nbsp;his rank and authority, as tribune of the celeres, or captain&nbsp;of the knights, summoned the people to the forum, and proceeded to relate the bloody deed which the villany of Sextus Tarquinius had caused. Nor did he content himself&nbsp;with that, but set before them in the most animated manner the cruelty, tyranny, and oppression of Tarquinius himself ; the guilty manner in which he obtained the kingdom,&nbsp;the violent means he had used to retain it, and the unjust&nbsp;repeal of all the laws of Servius Tullius, by which he had&nbsp;robbed them of their liberties. By this means he so effectually roused the people, that they passed a decree abolishing the kingly power itself, and banishing for ever Lucius&nbsp;Tarquinius Superbus, and his wife and children. In the&nbsp;midst of the tumult the wicked Tullia fled from her house&nbsp;and the city, pursued by the curses of the whole population&nbsp;wherever she passed, imprecating upon her head the vengeance of the furies, for the murder of her sister, husband,&nbsp;and father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Intelligence of the tumult had in the mean time reached the camp at Ardea. Tarquinius hastened to the city, if&nbsp;possible to suppress it; and Brutus, assigning the command&nbsp;of the city to Lucretius, set out himself for the camp, taking a different road, so as to avoid meeting the dethroned&nbsp;usurper. When he reached the camp he soon roused in the&nbsp;army the same indignation against the tyrant, which had&nbsp;blazed so strongly at Rome. The commanders of the troops&nbsp;joined him ; the army adhering to the observances of the&nbsp;comitia centuriata, confirmed in legal form the decree of&nbsp;the citizens, banishing the Tarquin family, and abolishing&nbsp;the regal name and power tbr ever. They then made a&nbsp;truce with the Ardeans for fifteen years, and marched towards Rome. Tarquinius, finding the gates shut against&nbsp;him, and learning the defection of the army, fled with his&nbsp;sons to Caere in Etruria. Thus ended the reign of Tarquinius Superbus ; and with it the existence of the monarchical form of government at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The monarchical form of government being thus abolished, the next step was to constitute another in its stead. Lucretius was appointed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter-rex,</span><span class="font0"> and the comitia centuriata were held by his authority in the Campus Martius, when&nbsp;Brutus and Collatinus were chosen to be supreme magistrates,&nbsp;at first with the name of prætors, which was afterwards&nbsp;changed to that of consuls, by which title, as the better&nbsp;known, we shall continue to designate these colleagues in&nbsp;the chief power. They retained all the power of the kings,&nbsp;and all the insignia of royalty, except the diadem ; but the&nbsp;rods and axes, the emblems of tlle power of life and death,&nbsp;were carried before each alternately for a month. In order&nbsp;that the sacred rites might be duly performed, they appointed a priest with the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king of the sacrifices,</span><span class="font0"> but without political power. They then proceeded to fill up the&nbsp;due number of three hundred in the senate, which had been&nbsp;diminished partly by the tyranny </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the last king, and partly by the flight ofhis adherents, who were implicated in his&nbsp;crimes. They restored those laws of Servius Tullius which&nbsp;were favourable to the commonalty ; and re-appointed the&nbsp;meetings and common sacrifices of the tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome seemed now to have regained its liberties, but it had not obtained the sense of security. It was thought&nbsp;necessary to banish Collatinus, who was the nephew of Tarquinius, that there might remain none of that hated race in&nbsp;the city. Collatinus yielding without a struggle, withdrew&nbsp;to Lavinium, and there died in old age. Publius Valerius&nbsp;was elected consul in his stead, by the comitia centuriata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not to be expected that the banished king would submit without a contest. He first attempted to induce&nbsp;the Latin states to espouse his quarrel ; and finding them&nbsp;unwilling, he applied to the Etruscans. Ambassadors were&nbsp;sent from Etruria to demand the restitution of his private&nbsp;property. This demand gave rise to warm discussions,&nbsp;whether they should obey justice by giving up the private&nbsp;property ofTarquinius, or prudence, by refiιsing to put money&nbsp;into the hands of an enemy, which they foresaw would soon&nbsp;be used against themselves. The plea of justice prevailed,&nbsp;and the property was ordered to be restored. But during&nbsp;the discussion, and the period required for collecting&nbsp;the property, the Etruscan ambassadors were intriguing with the younger patricians in the formation of a&nbsp;plot to restore the king. Considerable numbers of the&nbsp;more haughty of them, offended with the favour shewn to&nbsp;the commons, joined in the conspiracy, among whom were&nbsp;the two sons of Brutus himself. The conspiracy was discovered by the information of a slave, who had overheard&nbsp;them while concocting this plot in secret. The two consuls&nbsp;called the people to the comitium, and commanded the&nbsp;conspirators to be brought bound before them. The whole&nbsp;plot was detected ; the Etruscan ambassadors permitted to&nbsp;depart uninjured, out of respect to the laws of nations ; and&nbsp;the convicted traitors thrown into prison to await their trial.&nbsp;Next day the trial was conducted in public, and sentence&nbsp;of condemnation passed. Brutus commanded the sentence&nbsp;to be put in execution upon his own sons. They were stripped, beaten with rods, and then beheaded. Nor till this&nbsp;fearful example of stern retributive justice had been completed did Brutus leave the assembly ; and when he departed, the people could do no less than inflict an equal doom&nbsp;on the remaining conspirators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The private danger was thus turned aside, but a public tempest was at hand. The Etruscan cities of Tarquinii and&nbsp;Veii took up arms in the cause of the banished king, and&nbsp;advanced against Rome. The Romans crossed the Tiber&nbsp;to encounter the foe ; and the two armies met near the grove&nbsp;of Arsia. Before the battle began, Brutus, who was riding&nbsp;at the head of the Roman cavalry, was descried by Aruns&nbsp;Tarquinius, who led those of Etruria. The banished prince,&nbsp;burning with personal hatred, spurred his steed furiously&nbsp;against the consul. Brutus, with equal animosity, met him&nbsp;in mid career ; and in the shock each pierced the body of&nbsp;his antagonist with his spear, and they fell wounded and&nbsp;dying together to the ground. The cavalry on each&nbsp;side hastened to avenge their leaders ; the battle became&nbsp;general ; each right wing lvas victorious over its opponent ;&nbsp;and after a long and bloody struggle, night put an end to&nbsp;the undecided contest. Both parties kept the field; but in&nbsp;the dead of night a voice was heard from the adjacent grove,&nbsp;declaring that the Etruscans had lost one man more than&nbsp;the Romans, who were, and would be victorious. A panic&nbsp;seized the enemy, they deserted their camp and fled ; and&nbsp;at dawn the Romans found nothing to do but to carry off&nbsp;the booty. Valerius returned to the city in triumph, and&nbsp;in the forum pronounced a funeral oration over the body of&nbsp;Brutus. The matrons mourned for him a whole year, and&nbsp;his statue was placed in the Capitol, among the kings, with&nbsp;a sword in his hand.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
