<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Modern City</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Great changes in the municipal and social conditions of Rome followed the occupation of the city by the Italians (20th&nbsp;September 1870), and the rapid increase of population due to&nbsp;immigration from other parts of Italy. It is a mistake, however,&nbsp;to attribute all the works undertaken and executed since 1870&nbsp;to the initiative of the new government. The first plan for&nbsp;modernizing and improving Rome was that of Pope Julius II.,&nbsp;who aimed at the enlargement of the lower city on both sides&nbsp;of the Tiber. The modern Via Giuba shows in part what he&nbsp;meant to do. Following him, Sixtus V. did his best to develop&nbsp;the upper part of the city by laying out the Via Sistina, from&nbsp;the Trinità dei Monti to S. Maria Maggiore and Porta S. Giovanni.&nbsp;Almost in our own time a plan for the improvement of the&nbsp;city was made, under the direction of Mgr. de Merode, during&nbsp;the reign of Pius IX.; and although but a small portion of&nbsp;the projected changes were carried out under the pope, the&nbsp;general scheme was in most respects satisfactory, and proved&nbsp;a good foundation for further extensive developments. He&nbsp;was able to complete the construction of the beautiful ascent&nbsp;to S. Pietro in Montorio, as well as that which leads up to the&nbsp;Quirinal Palace; and the Via Nazionale, which was to have&nbsp;been called Via De Merode, was also begun. His plan did&nbsp;not include, however, the destruction of villas such as the&nbsp;Lu dovisi, nor the wholesale removal of trees, which is so&nbsp;greatly to be deplored. These acts of barbarism were the&nbsp;consequences of the reckless speculations in land and buildings&nbsp;that accompanied and followed the active and excellent ^vork&nbsp;done by the municipality, and might bave been checked by&nbsp;vigorous and timely action of the government. As it was,&nbsp;a number of the most important Roman families were ruined.&nbsp;At the outset, and as soon as‘political circumstances admitted&nbsp;the consideration of such matters, the municipality set to&nbsp;work; and though a comprehensible love of the picturesque&nbsp;has caused many persons to regret the result, altogether or in&nbsp;part, it is not to be denied that the improvements carried&nbsp;out have been of the highest advantage to the city, and that&nbsp;the work is in many instances of creditable solidity,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two principal problems presented themselves. The more important was the confinement of the Tiber in such a manner&nbsp;as to render impossible the serious floods which had from time&nbsp;to time inundated the city, often causing great damage to property and rendering the lower streets more or less impassable.&nbsp;There were floods which almost reached the level of the first&nbsp;storey near San Carlo in the Corso, and it was common to see&nbsp;the great Piazza Navona and the neighbourhood of the Pantheon full of water for days together during the winter. The&nbsp;interruption of traffic can be imagined, and the damage to&nbsp;property was serious. The other urgent matter was one of&nbsp;which the government of Pius IX. had been partially aware,&nbsp;namely, the necessity for opening better thoroughfares between&nbsp;different parts of the city. In the middle ages the population&nbsp;of Rome had dwindled to twenty or thirty thousand inhabitants,&nbsp;who lived huddled together about the strongholds of the barons,&nbsp;and the modem city had slowly grown again upon the exiguous&nbsp;foundation of a medieval town. The need for changing this&nbsp;condition of things, which had been felt under Pius IX., became&nbsp;overwhelmingly apparent as the population rapidly increased.&nbsp;That which under a continuance of the old government might&nbsp;have been done by degrees during a long period, had to be&nbsp;accomplished in the shortest possible time, with means which,&nbsp;though considerable, were far from adequate, and in the face of&nbsp;opposition by many holders of real estate, the most important&nbsp;of whom were conservatively attached to the papal government, and resisted change for no other reason. In what was&nbsp;now done it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the work&nbsp;undertaken and carried out by the municipality, under considerable pressure of circumstances, and that which was done&nbsp;in the way of private speculation. The first was on the whole&nbsp;good, and has proved enduring; the second was in many cases&nbsp;bad, and resulted in great loss. As soon as the opening of such&nbsp;streets as the Via Nazionale and the Via Cavour, the widening&nbsp;and straightening of the Via dell’ Angelo Custode, now the Via&nbsp;del Tritone Nuovo, and similar improvements, such as the con- *&nbsp;struction of new bridges over the Tiber, had demonstrated that&nbsp;the value of property could be doubled and quadrupled in a .&nbsp;short time, and as soon as the increase of population had caused&nbsp;a general rise in rents, owners of property awoke to the situation&nbsp;of affairs, and became as anxious as they had at first been disinclined to improve their estates by wholesale building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most important and expensive work executed by the government with the assistance of the municipality was the&nbsp;construction of the embankments along the Tiber. Though&nbsp;damaged by the great flood of December 1900, their truly Roman&nbsp;solidity saved the city from the disastrous consequences of a&nbsp;wide inundation. It is impossible not to admire them, and not&nbsp;to feel respect for a people able to carry out such a plan in such&nbsp;a manner and in so short a time, in the face of such great difficulties. But so far as the life of the city was concerned, the&nbsp;cutting of new streets and the widening of old ones produced&nbsp;a more apparent immediate result. The opening of such a&nbsp;thoroughfare as the Via Nazionale could not but prove to be of&nbsp;the greatest value. It begins at the Piazza delle Terme, in&nbsp;which the principal railway station is situated, and connects&nbsp;the upper part of the city by a broad straight road, and then,&nbsp;by easy gradients, with the Forum of Trajan, the Piazza dei&nbsp;Santi Apostoli and the Piazza di Venezia, whence, as the Corso&nbsp;Vittorio Emanuele, it runs through the heart of the old city,&nbsp;being designed to reach St Peter’s by a new bridge of the same&nbsp;name, near the bridge of S. Angelo. It is true that, in order to&nbsp;accomplish this, the Villa Aldobrandini had to be partially destroyed, but this is almost the only point which lovers of beauty&nbsp;can regret, and in compensation it opened to full view the&nbsp;famous palace of the Massimo family, the imposing church of&nbsp;S. Andrea della Valle, and the noble pile of the Cancelleria, one&nbsp;of the best pieces of architecture in Rome. Another great&nbsp;artery is the Via Cavour, which was intended to connect the&nbsp;railway station with the south-western part of Rome, descending&nbsp;to the Forum, and thence turning northwards to reach the&nbsp;Piazza di Venezia on the east side of the monument to Victor&nbsp;Emanuel II. These are only examples of what was done, for it&nbsp;would be impossible to give a just idea of the transformation of&nbsp;the city. Rome is now divided clearly into two parts, the old&nbsp;and the new, of which the old is incomparably the more artistic&nbsp;and the more beautiful, as it will always remain the more interesting. Among the works carried out by the government and&nbsp;municipality the fine tunnel under the Quirinal Hill (completed&nbsp;in 1002) deserves mention; it forms a connecting channel for&nbsp;the traffic between the streets at the north end of the old city,&nbsp;the Corso, Babuino, &amp;c., and the upper part of Rome, including&nbsp;the Via Nazionale and the Esquiline. Another difficult undertaking, successfully completed in April 1908, was the construction of the enormous causeway and bridge which now unite the&nbsp;Pincio with the Villa Borghese, or, as it is now called, the Villa&nbsp;Umberto Primo, to the immense advantage of the public. In&nbsp;the same year the building for the new law courts was finished;&nbsp;it stands near S. Angelo, and presents, on the whole, an imposing&nbsp;appearance, though overloaded with clumsy stone ornamentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is unnecessary to mention a number of public buildings and government offices which have little architectural merit, but w*e&nbsp;cannot overlook such a magnificent group of buildings devoted&nbsp;to scientific purposes as the Policlinico, on the Macas, which is&nbsp;admittedly one of the finest hospitals in Europe, and the military</span></p>
