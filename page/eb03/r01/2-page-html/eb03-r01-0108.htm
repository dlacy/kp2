<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">*where </span><span class="font2">the characters do not </span><span class="font3">ſtrike</span><span class="font2"><sup>,</sup>unlefs they are exaggerated. He did not purſue the method of the Fle-milh painters of ſiniſhing his pieces. He fometimes gave his light ſuch thick touches, that it ſeemed more&nbsp;like modelling than painting. A head of his has been&nbsp;ſhown, the noſe of which was fo thick of paint, as that&nbsp;which he copied from nature. He was told one day, that&nbsp;by his peculiar method of employing colours, his pieces&nbsp;appeared rugged and uneven—he replied, he was a&nbsp;painter, and not a dyer. He took a pleaſure in dreſſing his figures in an extraordinary manner : with this&nbsp;view he had collected a great number of eaſtern caps,&nbsp;ancient armour, and drapery long ſince out of faſhion.&nbsp;when he was adviſed to conſult antiquity to attain a&nbsp;better taſte in drawing, as his was uſually heavy and&nbsp;uneven, he took his counſellor to the cloſet where theie&nbsp;old veſtments were depoſited, -faying, by way of deri-ſion, thoſe were his antiques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rembrandt, like moſt men of genius, had many caprices. Being one day at work, painting a whole family in a ſingle picture, word being brought him that his monkey was dead, he was ſo affected at the loſs of&nbsp;this animal, that, without paying any attention to the&nbsp;perſons who were fitting for their pictures, he painted&nbsp;the monkey upon the ſame canvas. This whim could&nbsp;not ſail of diſpleafing thoſe the piece was deſigned for;&nbsp;but he would not efface it, chooſing rather to loſe the&nbsp;dale of his picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This freak will appear ſtill more extraordinary in Rembrandt, when it is conſidered that hc was extremely&nbsp;avaricious ; which vice daily grew upon him. He practiſed various ſtratagems to Fell his prints at a high&nbsp;price. The public were very deſirous of purchafing&nbsp;them, and not without reaſon. In his prints the ſame&nbsp;taſte prevails as in his pictures ; they are rough and&nbsp;irregular, but pictureſque. In order to heighten the&nbsp;value of his prints, and increaſe their price, he made&nbsp;his ſon fell them as if he had purloined them from his&nbsp;father ; others he expofed at public ſales, and went&nbsp;thither himſelf in diſguſſe to bid ſor them ; ſometimes&nbsp;fie gave out that he was going to leave Holland, and&nbsp;iettle in another conntry. Theſe ſtratagems were ſuc-eeſsful, and he got his own price for his prints. At&nbsp;other times he would print his plates half finiſhed, and&nbsp;expoſe them to ſale ; he afterwards finiſhed them, and&nbsp;they became ſrtſh plates, when they wanted retouch-ing, he made ſome alterations in them, which promoted the ſale of his prints a third time, though they&nbsp;differed but little ſrom the firſt impreſſions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His pupils, who were not ignorant of his avarice, one day painted ſome pieces of money upon cards ; and&nbsp;Rembrandt no ſooner ſaw them, than he was going to&nbsp;take them up. Hc was not angry at the pleaſantry,&nbsp;but his avarice ſtill prevailed. He died in 1674.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMEMBRANCE, is when the idea of ſomething formerly known recurs again to the mind without the operation of a like object on the external ſen-fo^ry. See Memory and Reminiscence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REMINISCENCE, that power of the human mind, whereby it recollects itſelf, or calls again into its remembrance ſuch ideas or notions as it had really forgot : in which it differs from memory, which is a&nbsp;treaſuring up of things in the mind, and keeping them&nbsp;there, without forgetting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMISSION, in phyſtcs, the abatement of the power or efficacy of any quality ; in oppoſttion to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">increaſe</span><span class="font2"> of the ſame, which is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">intenjion.</span></p>
