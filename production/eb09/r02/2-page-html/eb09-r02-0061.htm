<p><span class="font1">represents the work as written under Domitian and even towards the close of his reign. This tradition rests on&nbsp;very ancient testimony, that of Irenæus,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> but has met&nbsp;with no approval from critics of the present century;&nbsp;only the traditionalists who reject the historical interpretation accept it. It is the only case in the whole range of&nbsp;the New Testament where criticism assigns to a writing a&nbsp;higher antiquity than is allowed it by tradition. Whether&nbsp;criticism has not been too hasty in setting aside the&nbsp;statement of Irenæus will appear in the sequel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In support of the supposition that the Apocalypse was written before August 70 a.d., the chief argument&nbsp;adduced is that ch. xi. assumes that Jerusalem and the&nbsp;temple are still uninjured. Mommsen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Röm. Gesch.,</span><span class="font1"> v.&nbsp;521) has not succeeded in satisfactorily disposing of this&nbsp;argument. The Apocalypse is cognizant of the flight of&nbsp;the Jewish Christians into the country beyond Jordan&nbsp;towards Pella (ch. xii.); it expects the partial destruction&nbsp;of Jerusalem in the immediate future.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> But this very&nbsp;expectation as well as the confidence that the temple&nbsp;would remain uninjured shows that at that time city and&nbsp;temple were still standing. Hence, as ch. xi. was written&nbsp;before August 70, most critics, assuming that the whole&nbsp;book dates from one and the same time, conclude that&nbsp;it was composed under Galba,—that is, between autumn&nbsp;68 and spring 69. In their view the five emperors who&nbsp;have fallen are Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Caligula,&nbsp;and Nero, therefore the reigning emperor is Galba,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> and&nbsp;the reason why the author does not make antichrist (the&nbsp;returning Nero) immediately succeed Galba is a wish to&nbsp;carry on the number seven, and because “ even a prophet&nbsp;owes some consideration to the powers that be ” ; but he&nbsp;allows this unknown successor only a short reign, and then&nbsp;comes the returned Nero and the end of the world.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Lastly, these critics point to the fact that a false Nero&nbsp;appeared immediately after the death of the real Nero&nbsp;(Tacitus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hist.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 8, 9). This position is very strong, but&nbsp;there are two objections to it,—in the first place, it is&nbsp;uncertain whether Galba should be included in the list of&nbsp;emperors at all—so eminent an authority as Mommsen is&nbsp;against including him, and reckons Vespasian as the sixth,&nbsp;and, secondly, the author of the Apocalypse thinks of a false&nbsp;Nero who will ally himself with the Parthians (see ch. ix.&nbsp;and elsewhere). Therefore his false Nero appears not to&nbsp;be that of Tacitus, but the one who in the last years of&nbsp;Vespasian found a following in the Euphrates district and&nbsp;was acknowledged in the reign of Titus by King Artabanus,&nbsp;who prepared to restore him at Rome by force of arms,&nbsp;but was at last surrendered by the Parthians, about 88,&nbsp;to Domitian (so Mommsen ; compare Persia, vol. xviii. ρ.&nbsp;603). On this view the Apocalypse was written about&nbsp;75-79. Thus we see that we have here two discrepant&nbsp;calculations (autumn 68 to spring 69; about 75-79);&nbsp;each has much in favour of it, but also at least one strong&nbsp;argument against it :—against the first calculation there&nbsp;is the argument that the false Nero who best suits the case&nbsp;did not appear till about 75, while against the second calculation there is the argument that according to ch. xi. the&nbsp;destruction of Jerusalem had not yet taken place.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> In these</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">circumstances it appears perhaps best to assume that the Apocalypse was written under Galba, that is, that the conception and the first draught of it date from this time,&nbsp;but that the seventeenth chapter was afterwards revised&nbsp;in the last years of the reign of Vespasian, about 75-79. Now it is to be remembered that Irenæus asserts&nbsp;most explicitly that it was revealed in the last years of&nbsp;Domitian. Such a statement is not to be simply set aside,&nbsp;especially when it seems to make a writing later, and not&nbsp;earlier, and when there is internal evidence that the book&nbsp;underwent revisions. Further exact investigation of the&nbsp;details of the Apocalypse will perhaps supply positive&nbsp;proofs ; at present the following can be put forward merely&nbsp;as an hypothesis, for which only a certain probability is&nbsp;claimed :—the Apocalypse was written under Galba, but&nbsp;afterwards underwent revisions under Vespasian, about&nbsp;75-79, and perhaps in Domitian’s reign of terror, about&nbsp;93-96 (compare what has been said above on the unity&nbsp;and integrity).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Place of Composition—Authorship.</span><span class="font1">—That the Apocalypse was written at some place on the west coast of Asia Minor&nbsp;has never, so far as known to the present writer, been&nbsp;doubted by any critic of note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tradition of the church ascribes the Apocalypse to the apostle John,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> and the Tübingen school has felt bound&nbsp;in this case to agree with tradition. Within the last&nbsp;twenty years or so the question has been much complicated&nbsp;by being mixed up with the question of the origin of the&nbsp;Fourth Gospel; all, however, agree that the book was&nbsp;written by a born Jew. At present the following views&nbsp;are maintained :—(1) the Gospel and the Apocalypse of John&nbsp;are by the apostle John (Ebrard, Hengstenberg and his&nbsp;school, Hofmann and his school, Kliefoth) ; (2) the Gospel&nbsp;is by an unknown author, the Apocalypse is by the apostle&nbsp;John (Baur, Schwegler, Köstlin, Hilgenfeld) ; (3) the&nbsp;Gospel is by the apostle John, the Apocalypse is by a man&nbsp;called John, the otherwise known presbyter, who had no&nbsp;wish to be taken for the apostle (Lücke, Bleek, Ewald,&nbsp;Credner, De Wette, Neander, Reuss, Düsterdieck, Keim,&nbsp;Holtzmann, &amp;c.) ;</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> (4) the Apocalypse is by another John,&nbsp;one of the apostle’s disciples, who afterwards received the&nbsp;tacit approval of the apostle, so that the Revelation passed&nbsp;in the church as a work of the apostle (Renan) ; (5) the&nbsp;Apocalypse was foisted on the apostle John without his&nbsp;knowledge (Volckmar, &amp;c.). Of these views the first and&nbsp;fourth may be summarily dismissed, the latter because&nbsp;Renan has not brought forward even the shadow of a proof,&nbsp;the former because the differences between the Apocalypse&nbsp;and the Gospel in language and opinions are too great to&nbsp;allow us to suppose that the books are by the same author.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>8&nbsp;</sup>It is true that on the other hand both writings have much&nbsp;in common, nay, even that there is a profound affinity&nbsp;between them, but this only proves that their authors&nbsp;lived in the same country, and were to some extent subject&nbsp;to the same intellectual influences. Even Hase, who&nbsp;formerly thought it possible to refer Gospel and Apocalypse&nbsp;to the apostle John (see his work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Tübinger Schule,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1855), has renounced this view. But what is to prevent&nbsp;us from ascribing at least the Apocalypse to the apostle</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">69 and August 70, hence in the beginning of Vespasian’s reign, has least to recommend it. Some of the critics who have maintained&nbsp;it are much biased. Thus Diisterdieck regards the sixth emperor&nbsp;(xvii. 10) as Vespasian, the seventh, who is to remain for only a&nbsp;short time, as Titus, and the eighth as Nero. But, as the book was&nbsp;written, according to Diisterdieck, shortly before 70, it follows that&nbsp;‘<sup>1</sup> we have here a prophecy which definitely announces certain historical&nbsp;events beforehand.” Thus the claim of the Apocalypse to be an actual&nbsp;prophecy is justified, though only in one verse.</span></p>
