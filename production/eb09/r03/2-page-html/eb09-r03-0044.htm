        <p><span class="font2">resembling those of the heroic kings of Greece. He rules for life,
                and he is the sole ruler, unfettered by written&nbsp;statutes. He is the supreme
                judge, settling all disputes&nbsp;and punishing wrongdoers even with death. All
                other&nbsp;officials are appointed by him. He imposes taxes, distributes lands, and
                erects buildings. Senate and assembly&nbsp;meet only when he convenes them, and meet
                for little else&nbsp;than to receive communications from him. In war he
                is&nbsp;absolute leader@@<sup>1</sup> and finally he is also the religious
                head&nbsp;of the community. It is his business to consult the gods&nbsp;on its
                behalf, to offer the solemn sacrifices, and to announce&nbsp;the days of the public
                festivals. Hard by his house was&nbsp;the common hearth of the state, where the
                vestal virgins&nbsp;cherished the sacred fire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">By the side of the king stood the senate, or council of elders. In
                the descriptions left us of the primitive senate,&nbsp;as in those of the “ rex,” we
                can discover traces of a&nbsp;transition from an earlier state of things when Rome
                was&nbsp;only an assemblage of clans or village communities, allied&nbsp;indeed, but
                each still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen,&nbsp;to one in which these groups
                have been fused into a single&nbsp;state under a common ruler. On the one hand the
                senate&nbsp;appears as a representative council of chiefs, with inalienable
                prerogatives of its own, and claiming to be the&nbsp;ultimate depository of the
                supreme authority and of the&nbsp;“ sacra ” connected with it. The senators are the
                “ patres ”;&nbsp;they are taken from the leading “ gentes ” ; they hold
                their&nbsp;seats for life ; to them the “ auspicia ” revert on the death&nbsp;of a
                king; they appoint the interrex from their own body,&nbsp;are consulted in the
                choice of the new king,@@<sup>2</sup> and their&nbsp;sanction is necessary to ratify
                the vote of the assembled&nbsp;freemen. On the other hand they are no longer
                supreme.&nbsp;They cannot appoint a king but with the consent of the&nbsp;community,
                and their relation to the king when appointed&nbsp;is one of subordination.
                Vacancies in their ranks are filled&nbsp;up by him, and they can but give him advice
                and counsel&nbsp;when he chooses to consult them.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The popular assembly of united Rome in its earliest days was that in
                which the freemen met and voted by&nbsp;their curiae (comitia curiata@@<sup>3</sup>.
                The assembly met in&nbsp;the comitium at the north-east end of the
                    forum,@@<sup>4</sup> at the&nbsp;summons and under the presidency of the king
                or, failing&nbsp;him, of the “interrex.” By the “rex” or “interrex”&nbsp;the
                question was put, and the voting took place&nbsp;“ curiatim,” the curiae being
                called up in turn. The&nbsp;vote of each curia was decided by the majority of
                individual votes, and a majority of the votes of the curiae&nbsp;determined the
                final result. But the occasions on which&nbsp;the assembly could exercise its power
                must have been&nbsp;few. Their right to elect magistrates was
                apparently&nbsp;limited to the acceptance or rejection of the king proposed&nbsp;by
                the interrex. Of the passing of laws, in the later sense&nbsp;of the term, there is
                no trace in the kingly period.&nbsp;Dionysius’s statement.@@<sup>5</sup> that they
                voted on questions of&nbsp;war and peace is improbable in itself and unsupported
                by&nbsp;tradition. They are indeed represented, in one instance,&nbsp;as deciding a
                capital case, but it is by the express permission of the king and not of
                    right.@@<sup>6</sup> Assemblies of the&nbsp;people were also, and probably more
                frequently, convened&nbsp;for other purposes. Not only did they meet to hear
                from&nbsp;the king the announcement of the high days and holidays&nbsp;for each
                month, and to witness such solemn religious rites&nbsp;as the inauguration of a
                priest, but their presence (and sometimes their vote) was further required to
                authorize and attest certain acts, which in a later age assumed a more&nbsp;private
                character. The disposal of property by will@@<sup>7</sup> and&nbsp;the solemn
                renunciation of family or gentile “sacra”@@<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>could only take place
                in the presence of the assembled&nbsp;freemen, while for
                adoption@@<sup>9</sup>(arrogatio) not only their&nbsp;presence but their formal
                consent was necessary.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Such in outline was the political structure of the Roman state at the
                earliest period known to us. It is&nbsp;clear that it belongs to a comparatively
                advanced stage in&nbsp;the development of society, and that a long
                previous&nbsp;history lies behind it. Traces of an older and more&nbsp;primitive
                order of things still linger in the three ancient&nbsp;shadowy tribes, in the curiae
                and gentes, in many of the&nbsp;features noticeable in the senate; but they are
                traces of an&nbsp;order that has passed away. The supremacy of the state&nbsp;is
                established over the groups out of whose fusion it has&nbsp;grown, and such of these
                groups as still retain a distinct&nbsp;existence are merely private corporations.
                Private differences are settled and wrongdoers punished by the state&nbsp;tribunals,
                and even within the close limits of the family&nbsp;the authority of the head is
                limited by the claims of the&nbsp;state upon the services of the sons and
                dependants.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">A history of this early Roman state is out of the question. The
                names, dates, and achievements of the first four kings are all too unsubstantial to
                form the basis of a&nbsp;sober narrative ;@@<sup>10</sup> a few points only can be
                considered as&nbsp;fairly well established. If we except the long
                eventless&nbsp;reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the
                first&nbsp;kings as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours. The details
                of these wars are no doubt mythical;&nbsp;but the implied condition of continual
                struggle, and the&nbsp;narrow range within which the struggle is confined,
                may&nbsp;be accepted as true. The picture drawn is that of a&nbsp;small community
                with a few square miles of territory,&nbsp;at deadly feud with its nearest
                neighbours, within a&nbsp;radius of some 12 miles round Rome. Nor, in spite&nbsp;of
                the repeated victories with which tradition credits&nbsp;Romulus, Ancus, and Tullus,
                does there seem to have&nbsp;been any real extension of Roman territory except
                towards&nbsp;the sea. Fidense remains Etruscan; the Sabines continue masters up to
                the Anio; Prseneste, Gabii, and&nbsp;Tusculum are still untouched; and on this side
                it is doubtful if Roman territory, in spite of the possible destruction&nbsp;of
                Alba, extended to a greater distance than, the sixth&nbsp;milestone from
                    Rome.@@<sup>11</sup> But along the course of the Tiber&nbsp;below the city there
                was a decided advance. The fortification of the Janiculum, the building of the
                “pons&nbsp;sublicius,” the foundation of Ostia, and the acquisition of&nbsp;the
                saltworks near the sea may all be safely ascribed to&nbsp;this early period. Closely
                connected, too, with the control&nbsp;of the Tiber from Rome to the sea was the
                subjugation of&nbsp;the petty Latin communities lying south of the river;&nbsp;and
                the tradition of the conquest and destruction of Poli-torium, Tellenre, and Ficana
                is confirmed by the absence&nbsp;in historical times of any Latin communities in
                this&nbsp;district.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">With the reign of theifth king Tarquinius Priscus a marked change
                takes place. The traditional accounts of&nbsp;the last three kings not only wear a
