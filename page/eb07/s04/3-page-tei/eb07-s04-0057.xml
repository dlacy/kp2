If the king should quit the kingdom without the consent of the Cortes, he is understood to have abdicated the crown. 3. The king cannot alienate any part of the Spanish territory. 4. He cannot abdicate the crown in favour of his successor without the consent of the Cortes. 5. He cannot enter into any political alliance, or make commercial treaties, with out the consent of the Cortes. 6. He cannot grant privileges or monopolies. 7. The king cannot disturb any in dividual in the enjoyment of his property, nor deprive him of his personal liberty. If the interest of the state should require the arrest of any individual by virtue of a royal order, the prisoner must be delivered over to a competent tribunal within eight and forty hours. 8. The king can not marry without the consent of the Cortes ; he is sup posed to abdicate the crown by taking a wife against their will.</p><p>The council of state is composed of forty individuals, viz. two bishops, two priests, and four grandees; the other thirty-two must not belong to any of these classes. The members of the council of state shall be chosen by the king, out of a triple list presented to him by the Cortes. The councillors of state cannot be removed without a trial before the supreme court of justice. Their salary is fixed by the Cortes. The functions of this council of state are to ad vise the king on all important matters of government, and especially upon giving or refusing his sanction to the laws, declaring war, or making treaties. The king, besides, can not bestow any ecclesiastical benefice, or appoint any judge, but at the proposal of the council of state, who, upon every vacancy, are to confine his choice to one out of three individuals, whose names they are to lay before his majesty.</p><p>The laws for the security of personal liberty are these : 1. No Spaniard can be imprisoned without a summary pro cess, in which he is credibly charged with the infraction of some law that subjects the offender to corporal punishment; 2. the arrest cannot take place without the warrant of a competent judge; 3. prisoners are not to be examined upon oath ; 4. the gaoler shall keep a register of the pri soners, expressing the warrant, and the alleged cause of his confinement.</p><p>The rapid series of misfortunes which had shaken the imperial throne of France to its foundations opened the way for the return of the captive Ferdinand to Madrid. The constitutionalists looked forward to his appearance in the country with no favourable eye, and the arrival of despatches from him to the regency threw them into great consternation. Ferdinand announced that he had concluded a treaty with Napoleon. This assumption of absolute power on the part of the king, without the knowledge of the Cortes, was aiming a direct blow at their authority, and violating the constitution recently established ; and they accordingly rejected the treaty. They likewise suspended the king from the exercise of all power till he should take the oath which the new constitution prescribed. He entered the Spanish territory on the 24th of March 1814, and took up his residence at Valencia. On his way he had not been slow to discover that the lower orders were in general in different to the constitution. The fact is, the new political principles had scarcely struck root among the people ; and with a very considerable party, consisting of grandees, dignitaries of the church, and others, the king was still absolute, and these flocked around their master. In the Cortes itself there was a strong body opposed to the new order of things. A petition, signed by sixty-nine members, was presented to the king, in which the Cortes was described as a mere tool</p><p>in the hands of a republican party, without freedom of debate, and acting under the control of a mob regularly hired to take possession of the galleries. Nothing, therefore, could be more favourable to Ferdinand’s resuming absolute power. Accordingly, on the 4th of May 1814, a decree was solemnly promulgated, in which the Cortes were declared illegal, and all their laws consequently rescinded. Some of the leading members were arrested, as a prelude to what was shortly to happen. Under their usual leaders, the priests, the lower orders broke out into fierce demonstrations of joy when the news of these events reached the chief towns, and the king proceeded in a sort of triumph to Madrid. Further arrests of the deputies of the late Cortes took place ; property was sequestrated and papers were seized ; judges were appointed to try obnoxious members ; but justice proving too tardy for the king’s eager spirit of revenge, he himself pronounced sentence on the prisoners in a wholesale manner, in open defiance of all law and justice. A few were capitally punished, and a great many more were con signed to dungeons. The inquisition was restored, and was urged to exert its powers against all persons suspected of liberal opinions. Monks became once more the sole direc tors of the king’s conscience, and the reign of absolutism and bigotry was completely restored.</p><p>But these arbitrary acts roused the dormant spirit of the Spanish people, and a revulsion of feeling was the conse quence. In vain did the court party silence the press or bribe it into their service ; facts which could not be concealed from the people daily pleaded the cause of liberty. Bribery and venality were soon observed to prevail around the throne ; the treasury was completely drained, and the army remained unpaid ; while, to add to the difficulties and dangers of Ferdinand’s position, armed bands of guerillas, now become organized banditti, swarmed over the country, setting the helpless magistrates at defiance, and commit ting all sorts of atrocities. Freemasonry was abolished, and effectually kept in check ; but a far more dangerous society, the members of which assumed the name of <hi rend="italic">Comuneros,</hi> was secretly formed, and, in spite of the inquisition and its emissaries, held meetings in most of the principal towns, and kept up an active correspondence among their lodges. The constitution was publicly burned ; but this served only to spread disaffection, and to give it an importance in the eyes of the people which it did not formerly possess. Cadiz having been fixed on as the headquarters of the liberals, a regular plan for the overthrow of the government was there formed, and its secret influence was extended through out the provinces. Our limits do not permit us to mention the numerous conspiracies which were discovered, and quenched in blood. They were sufficient to alarm any monarch but one wholly abandoned to the guidance of weak, wicked, or fanatical counsellors. Those who ventured to remonstrate with the king were banished or thrown into prison. The promise which he had made of granting a constitution founded on liberal principles remained un fulfilled, and for six years (18141820) Ferdinand reigned with absolute power. During that time there had been no less than twenty-five changes in the ministry', mostly sud den, and attended with severities. They were produced by the influence of the <hi rend="italic">camarilla,</hi> or individuals in the personal service of the king. Every attempt to save the state was frustrated by such counsellors ; and the overthrow of the government, now apparently inevitable, became accelerated by the loss of the American colonies.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>The army was the instrument of its fall.
