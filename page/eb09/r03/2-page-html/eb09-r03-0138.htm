                columns, were statues of the fifty Danaids, and opposite&nbsp;them their fifty
                bridegrooms on horseback (see schol. on Pers., ii.&nbsp;56), many fragments of which
                have been found. In the centre&nbsp;before the steps of the temple stood an altar

                same&nbsp;area was a small temple of Vesta (C<sup>,</sup>.7.A., i. p. 392),
                dedicated on&nbsp;28th April 12 b.c., when Augustus was elected pontifex

                Quadrata, surrounded by a circular trench called the Mundus, was also in
                some&nbsp;part of this great group of buildings. On the side towards the&nbsp;Circus
                Maximus was the palace of Augustus, which was excavated&nbsp;in 1775, and drawings
                of which were published by Guattani.@@<sup>3</sup> A&nbsp;great part shown by him
                has since then been destroyed, and all is&nbsp;now concealed ; the plan (48 in fig.
                17) is taken from Guattani.&nbsp;The whole group is described by Ovid </span><span

                1). Augustus&nbsp;also rebuilt the temple of Victory,@@<sup>4</sup> which gave its
                name to the&nbsp;Clivus A<sup>r</sup>ictoriffi ; this temple stood on the site of a
                prehistoric&nbsp;altar (Dionys., i. 32), and was more than once rebuilt,—e.&lt;∕.,
                by&nbsp;L. Postumius, 294 b.c. (Liv., x. 33). In 193 b.c. an ædicula to&nbsp;ATctory
                was built near it by Porcius Cato (Liv., xxxv. 9). Remains&nbsp;of the temple and a
                dedicatory inscription were found in 1725-28 @@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>not far from the
                church of S. Maria Libératrice ; the temple was&nbsp;of Parian marble, with
                Corinthian columns of Numidian giallo&nbsp;antico. The Area Apollinis and its group
                of buildings suffered in&nbsp;the fire of Nero, and were restored by Domitian. The
                whole was&nbsp;finally destroyed in the great fire of 363 (Ammian, xxiii. 3), but
                the&nbsp;Sibylline books were saved.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1"> The palace of Caligula occupies the northern angle of the Palatine,
                and extends over the Clivus Victorhe a long way towards the Clivus&nbsp;Palatinus
                (see fig. 17). This part of the Palatine was once occupied&nbsp;by the Lucus Vestæ,
                with the Sacellum Volrlpiæ and many fine&nbsp;private houses. Among these were the
                dwellings of Q. Lutatius&nbsp;Catulus, Q. Hortensius, Catiline, Scaurus, Crassus
                (Plin., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >H.N.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxvi. 3, 24), whose house was afterwards
                bought by Cicero,@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>and the house of Clodius, the view of which
                Cicero threatened to&nbsp;block out.@@<sup>7</sup> Many other wealthy Romans had
                houses on this part&nbsp;of the Palatine, so that the cost of the site for
                Caligula’s enormous&nbsp;palace must have been very great. The part now existing is
                little&nbsp;more than the gigantic substructures built to raise the
                principal&nbsp;rooms to the level of the top of the hill. The lowest parts of
                these&nbsp;face the Nova A<sup>r</sup>ia, opposite the Atrium A<sup>τ</sup>este, and
                many stories&nbsp;of small vaulted rooms built in mixed brick and opus
                reticulatum&nbsp;rise one above the other to the higher levels.@@<sup>8</sup> The
                palace extends&nbsp;over the Clivus Victoriæ, supported on lofty arches so as to
                leave&nbsp;the road unblocked ; many travertine or marble stairs lead to
                the&nbsp;upper rooms, some starting from the Nova Via, others from the&nbsp;Clivus
                Victoriæ. Its enormous extent is referred to by Pliny </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">{H. N.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxvi. 24). A
                large proportion of these substructures consist of&nbsp;dark rooms, some with no
                means of lighting, others with scanty&nbsp;borrowed light. AIany small rooms and
                stairs scarcely 2 feet wide&nbsp;can only have been used by slaves. The ground
                floors on the&nbsp;Nova ATa and the Clivus ATctorise appear to have been shops,
                judging from their wide openings, with travertine sills, grooved for the&nbsp;wooden
                fronts with narrow doors, which Roman shops seem always&nbsp;to have had,—very like
                those now used in the East. The upper and&nbsp;j&gt;rincipal rooms were once richly
                decorated with marble linings,&nbsp;columns, and mosaics ; but little of these now
                remains. By the side&nbsp;of the Clivus Victoriæ still exists the start of the
                bridge by which&nbsp;Caligula joined the Capitolium to the Palatium (Suet.,
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cal.,</span><span
                class="font1"> 22) ;&nbsp;it is partly supported on corbelled arches, richly
                decorated with&nbsp;delicate stucco reliefs ; the floor is of mosaic, and a piece of
                the&nbsp;open marble screen or balustrade is still </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">in situ.</span><span class="font1"> The
                intermediate&nbsp;parts of Caligula’s bridge were removed after his death, and the
                exit&nbsp;from the palace is blocked by a brick-faced wall, very little
                later&nbsp;in date than the palace itself. Near the bridge are some rooms&nbsp;very
                handsomely ornamented with a combination of coloured stucco&nbsp;reliefs and
                painting on the flat. The upper part of the palace,&nbsp;that above the Clivus
                Victoriæ, is faced wholly with brickwork,&nbsp;no opus reticulatum being used, as in
                the lower portions by the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Nova Via. This possibly marks a difference of date, and the
                occurrence of brick stamps of the latter part of the 1st century&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font0">A.D. </span><span class="font1">in various parts of the palace shows
                that a large portion of it&nbsp;is later than the time of Caligula.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The next great addition to the buildings of the Palatine was the
                magnificent suite of state apartments built by Domitian, over a&nbsp;deep natural
                valley running across the hill (see fig. 17). The&nbsp;valley was filled up. and the
                level of the new palace raised to a&nbsp;considerable height above the natural soil.
                Remains of a house,&nbsp;decorated with painting and rich marbles, exist under
                Domitian’s&nbsp;peristyle, partly destroyed by the foundations of cast
                concrete&nbsp;which cut right through it. The floor of this house shows
                the&nbsp;original level, far below that of the Flavian palace. The south&nbsp;angle
                of this great building adjoins the palace of Augustus, and it&nbsp;is connected with
                the palace of Caligula by a branch subterranean&nbsp;passage leading into the
                earlier crypto-porticus. These two buildings continued to be used as the private
                apartments of the emperor,&nbsp;the Flavian block consisting only of state rooms ;
                the words </span><span class="font0">AEDES&nbsp;PVBLICA </span><span class="font1"
                >were inscribed upon it by Nerva to show its public character. It consists of a
                large open peristyle, with columns of Oriental&nbsp;marble, at one end of which is
                the grand triclinium with magnificent paving of opus sectile in red and green basalt
                and coloured&nbsp;marbles, a piece of which is well preserved ; next to the
                triclinium,&nbsp;on to which it opens with large windows, is a nymphæum or
                room&nbsp;with marble-lined fountain and recesses for plants and statues.
                On&nbsp;the opposite side of the peristyle is a large throne-room, the walls&nbsp;of
                which were adorned with rows of pavonazetto and giallo columns&nbsp;and large marble
                niches, in which were colossal statues of porphyry&nbsp;and basalt ; at one side of
                this is the basilica, with central nave&nbsp;and apse and narrow aisles, over which
                were galleries. The apse,&nbsp;in which was the emperor’s throne, is screened off by
                open marble&nbsp;cancelli, a part of which still exists. It is of great interest as
                showing the origin of the Christian basilica ; S. Agnese fuori Ie AIura&nbsp;is
                exactly similar in arrangement (see Basilica, vol. iii. p.
                417).@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>On the other side of the throne-room is the Iararium, with
                altar&nbsp;and pedestal for a statue ; next to this is the grand
                staircase,&nbsp;which led to the upper rooms, now destroyed. The whole building,
                both floor and walls, was covered with the richest Oriental&nbsp;marbles, including
                all the varieties mentioned on p. 808. Outside were colonnades or porticus,—on one
                side of cipollino, on the&nbsp;other of travertine, the latter stuccoed and painted.
                The magnificence of the whole, crowded with fine Greek sculpture and
                covered&nbsp;with polished marbles of the most brilliant colours, is difficult
                now&nbsp;to realize ; a glowing description is given by Statius </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Silv.,</span><span class="font1"> iv.
                11,&nbsp;18 ; see also Plut., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Poplie.,</span><span class="font1"> 15, and AIart., viii. 36). Doors
                were&nbsp;arranged in the throne-room and basilica so that the emperor&nbsp;could
                slip out unobserved and reach by a staircase (30 in fig. 17)&nbsp;the
                crypto-porticus which communicates with Caligula’s palace.&nbsp;The vault of this
                passage was covered with mosaic of mixed marble&nbsp;and glass, a few fragments of
                which still remain ; its walls were&nbsp;lined with rich marbles ; it was lighted by
                a series of windows&nbsp;in the springing of the vault. This, as well as the Flavian
                palace,&nbsp;appears to have suffered more than once from fire, and in
                many&nbsp;places important restorations of the time of Severus, and some
                as&nbsp;late as the 4th century, are evident. In 1720-26 extensive excavations were
                made here for the Farnese duke of Parma, and an&nbsp;immense quantity of statues and
                marble architectural fragments&nbsp;were discovered, many of which are now at Naples
                and elsewhere.&nbsp;Among them were sixteen beautiful fluted columns of
                pavonazetto&nbsp;and giallo, fragments of the porphyry statues, and an
                immense&nbsp;door-sill of Pentelic marble, now used for the high altar of
                the&nbsp;Pantheon ; these all came from the throne-room. The excavations&nbsp;were
                carried on by Bianchini, who published a book on the
            subject.@@<sup>10</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the middle of the slopes of the Palatine, towards the Circus
                AIaximus, are considerable remains of buildings set against the&nbsp;wall of Romulus
                and covering one of its projecting spurs. This&nbsp;series of rooms with a long
                Corinthian colonnade has been supposed to be part of the Domus Gelotiana, from which
                Caligula&nbsp;used to watch the races in the circus below (Suet., </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cad.,</span><span class="font1"> 18).
                Little,&nbsp;however, of the existing remains is as early as the reign of
                Caligula,&nbsp;and the marble porticus apparently dates from the time of
                Severus.&nbsp;The rooms were partly marble-lined and partly decorated
                with&nbsp;painted stucco, on which are incised a number of interesting inscriptions
                and rude drawTngs. Here, in 1857, was found the celebrated (so-called) caricature of
                the Crucified Christ, now in the&nbsp;Aluseo Kircheriano, but which, more probably,
                has a Gnostic&nbsp;meaning.@@<sup>11</sup> The inscription </span><span
