<p><span class="font0">ROOSEVELT, THEODORE (1858-fj/j), twenty-sixth president of the United States, was born in New York City on the 27th of October 1858. The Roosevelt family@@<sup>1</sup> has been&nbsp;prominent in the life of New York for many generations, and is&nbsp;of Dutch origin. Mr Roosevelt’s mother, Martha Bullock,&nbsp;came from a family of Scotch-Irish and Huguenot origin equally&nbsp;prominent in Georgia. Each family may lay just claims to a&nbsp;history of more than ordinary social and political distinction.&nbsp;Although born in New York, Mr Roosevelt spent much of&nbsp;his boyhood* at Oyster Bay, the country home of his father,&nbsp;on Long Island Sound, where he began with a distinct purpose,&nbsp;unusual among boys of his age, to build up a naturally frail&nbsp;physique by rowing and swimming in the waters of Long&nbsp;Island Sound, and by riding over the hills and tramping through&nbsp;the woods of Long Island. That his early outdoor life furnished&nbsp;a definite training for his after career is indicated by the fact&nbsp;that when he was about fourteen years of age he went with&nbsp;his father on a tour up the Nile as far as Luxor, and on this&nbsp;journey he made a collection of Egyptian birds found in the&nbsp;Nile valley, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum in&nbsp;Washington, D.C. Mr Roosevelt w<sup>T</sup>as educated at Harvard&nbsp;University, where he graduated in the class of 1880;@@<sup>2</sup> his&nbsp;record for scholarship was creditable, and his interest in sports&nbsp;and athletics was especially manifest in his skill as a boxer. On&nbsp;leaving college he made a short visit to Europe, was elected to&nbsp;the London Alpine Club for climbing the Jungfrau and the&nbsp;Matterhorn, and returning to New York studied law for a brief&nbsp;period in the Law School of Columbia University and in the&nbsp;office of his uncle Robert B. Roosevelt. Determining to enter&nbsp;active politics, he gave up his legal studies without qualifying&nbsp;for the bar, and in 1881 was elected to the New York legislature as a regular Republican, although in opposition to the&nbsp;“ boss” of the assembly district for which he was a candidate.&nbsp;He was elected again in 1882 and in 1883, and at the age&nbsp;of twenty-four was his party’s candidate for Speaker of the&nbsp;Assembly. In 1884 he was a delegate of the Republican party&nbsp;to the convention in Chicago which nominated James G. Blaine&nbsp;for president. In the convention he opposed the nomination&nbsp;of’ Mr Blaine, and in a speech which attracted considerable&nbsp;attention for its vigour and courage advocated the nomination&nbsp;of Senator George F. Edmunds. After Mr Blaine’s nomination, however, he supported him in the campaign as the chosen&nbsp;candidate of the party, in spite of the fact that an important&nbsp;wing of the Republican party “ bolted ” the nomination and&nbsp;espoused the candidacy of Grover Cleveland, who was elected&nbsp;president. In 1884, partly because his political life seemed at&nbsp;least for the immediate present to be at an end, partly on account&nbsp;of the freedom and activity of out-of-door life, he bought two&nbsp;cattle ranches near Medora on the Little Missouri river in&nbsp;North Dakota, where he lived for two years, becoming intimately associated with the life and spirit of the western portion&nbsp;of the United States.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claas Martenszen van Roosevelt (or Rosenvelt) settled in&nbsp;New Amsterdam in 1649; his son Claas (or Nicholas) in 1700-1&nbsp;was a New York alderman of the Leislerian party; in the next&nbsp;three generations, Johannes, Cornelius and Jacobus (James) were&nbsp;merchants and (in 1748-67, 1785-1801 and 1797-99 and 1809,&nbsp;respectively) aldermen of New York; in the third generation the&nbsp;family became allied with the Schuylers. Isaac Roosevelt was a&nbsp;member of the Provincial Congress in 1775-77 and of the state&nbsp;Senate in 1777-86 and in 1788-92; in the state Assembly&nbsp;were James Roosevelt (1796-97), Cornelius C. Roosevelt (1803),&nbsp;James I. Roosevelt, jun. (1835-40), and Clinton Roosevelt (1837-40). James I. Roosevelt, jun. (1795-1875), was a Democratic&nbsp;member of the national House 01 Representatives in 1841-43,&nbsp;and a justice of the state Supreme Court in 1851-59. Nicholas&nbsp;J. Roosevelt (1767-1854), with John, Stevens, Robert R. Livingstone and Robert Fulton, was prominent in the development of&nbsp;steam navigation. His brother, Cornelius van Schaik Roosevelt&nbsp;(1794-1871), was a founder of the Chemical National Bank of New&nbsp;York, and the grandfather of the president. The president’s uncle,&nbsp;Robert Barnwell Roosevelt (1829-1906), was a New York lawyer,&nbsp;New York state fish commissioner in 1866-68, a member of the&nbsp;Committee of Seventy which exposed the corruption of Tammany&nbsp;in New York City,, a Democratic member of the national House&nbsp;of Representatives in 1871-73, U.S. minister to the Netherlands&nbsp;in 1888, and author of works on American game birds and fish.&nbsp;R. B. Roosevelt’s brother, the president’s father, Theodore Roosevelt&nbsp;(1831-1878), was a, glass importer, prominent in city charities, an&nbsp;organizer of the Union League Club, and the founder of the Orthopaedic Hospital. A cousin, James Henry Roosevelt (1800-1863),&nbsp;was founder of the Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. The&nbsp;president’s mother, Martha Bullock, was of an old Georgia family&nbsp;of Scotch-Irish and Huguenot extraction; her grandfather was&nbsp;Archibald Bullock (1730-1777), first president (1776-77) of&nbsp;Georgia; and her brother, James Dunwoody Bullock, often compared by Theodore Roosevelt to Colonel Newcome, was in 'the&nbsp;Confederate navy, and equipped in England vessels (including the&nbsp;“ Alabama ”) as Confederate cruisers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year he married Alice Hathaway Lee of Boston,&nbsp;who di^d in 1884 leaving one daughter. Later (in 1886) he married&nbsp;Edith Kermit Carow of New York City, and by this marriage had&nbsp;four sons and one daughter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">In 1886 he was the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, but was defeated by Abram F. Hewitt, the Tammany&nbsp;candidate, and received a smaller vote than Henry George,&nbsp;the candidate of the United Labor party. Mr Roosevelt,&nbsp;however, received a larger proportion of the total vote cast&nbsp;than any mayoralty candidate of the Republican party had&nbsp;previously received in New York City. In April 1889, on the&nbsp;accession to the presidency of Benjamin Harrison, Mr Roosevelt, then closely identified with the work of Civil Service&nbsp;reform, was appointed a member of the United States Civil&nbsp;Service Commission. In this office, until then one of minor&nbsp;importance, he served for six years. He made it not only&nbsp;nationally prominent, but instrumental in shaping the course&nbsp;of legislative and executive action by introducing into the&nbsp;work of the Commission an entirely new spirit and new methods.&nbsp;The annual reports, of which he was the chief author, became&nbsp;controversial pamphlets; he published hold replies to criticisms&nbsp;upon the work of the Commission; he explained its purposes&nbsp;to newspaper correspondents; when Congress refused to appropriate the amount which he helieved essential for the work,&nbsp;he made the necessary economies by abandoning examinations&nbsp;of candidates for the Civil Service in those districts whose&nbsp;representatives in Congress had voted to reduce the appropriation, thus very shrewdly bringing their adverse vote into disfavour among their own constituents; and during the six&nbsp;years of his commissionership more than twenty thousand&nbsp;positions for government </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">employés</span><span class="font0"> were taken out of the&nbsp;realm of merely political appointment and added to the classified&nbsp;service to be obtained and retained for merit only. In 1895&nbsp;he resigned from the Civil Service Commission and became&nbsp;President of the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of&nbsp;New York. After a strenuous two years in this office, he was&nbsp;appointed by President McKinley in 1897 assistant-secretary&nbsp;of the navy. He was certain that war with Spain was&nbsp;inevitable, and he did much to prepare the navy for hostilities,&nbsp;framing an important personnel bill, collecting ammunition,&nbsp;getting large appropriations for powder and ammunition used&nbsp;in improving the marksmanship of the navy by gunnery practice,&nbsp;buying transports and securing the distribution of ships and&nbsp;supplies (especially in the Pacific) in such a way that, when&nbsp;hostilities were declared, American naval victories w<sup>T</sup>ould be&nbsp;assured. He urged upon the administration the bold policy of&nbsp;protesting against the sailing of Cervera’s fleet, on the ground&nbsp;that it would be regarded as a warlike measure not against&nbsp;the Cuban revolutionaries, who had no navy, hut against the&nbsp;United States; and he advised that, if Cervera sailed, an American squadron be sent to meet him and to prevent his approach&nbsp;to America. At the outbreak of the war with Spain he resigned&nbsp;from the Navy Department and raised the first volunteer&nbsp;regiment of cavalry, popularly known as the “ Rough Riders,”&nbsp;because many of its members were Western cowboys and&nbsp;ranchmen expert in the handling of the rough and often unbroken horses of the Western frontier. The regiment also&nbsp;included college athletes, city clubmen and memhers of the&nbsp;New York police force, every man possessing some special&nbsp;qualification for the work in view. Mr Roosevelt declined&nbsp;the colonelcy of the regiment, preferring to take the post of&nbsp;lieutenant-colonel under his intimate friend Dr Leonard Wood,&nbsp;who, while a surgeon in the United States army, had served</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
