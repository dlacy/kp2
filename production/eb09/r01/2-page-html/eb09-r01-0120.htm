<p><span class="font2">parts of words. Camden mentions an instance of this kind of wit in a gallant who expressed his love to a woman&nbsp;named Rose Hill by painting in the border of his gown&nbsp;a rose, a hill, an eye, a loaf, and a well ; this, in the style&nbsp;of the rebus, reads “Rose Hill I love well.” This kind of&nbsp;wit was long practised by the great, who took the pains&nbsp;to find devices for their names. It was, however, happily&nbsp;ridiculed by Ben Jonson in the humorous description of&nbsp;Abel Drugger’s device in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alchemist</span><span class="font2"> and by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spectator&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in the device of Jack of Newberry. The name is also&nbsp;applied to arrangements of words in which the position of&nbsp;the several vocables is to be taken into account in divining&nbsp;the meaning. Thus “ I understand you undertake to overthrow my undertaking ” makes the rebus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">stand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take &nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you &nbsp;throw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">or in French</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">pir &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;venir</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">may be read “un soupir vient souvent d’un souvenir.” The original use of the word, which’ comes to us from&nbsp;France, was, however, wider : any equivoque or satirical&nbsp;pleasantry might be so named, and the origin of the term&nbsp;is ascribed by Ménage to the clerks of Picardy, who at&nbsp;carnival time used to put out satirical squibs called “ De&nbsp;rebus quæ geruntur.” “Rebus,” in heraldry, is a coat of&nbsp;arms which bears an allusion to the name of the person,—&nbsp;as three castles for Castleton, three cups for Butler, three&nbsp;conies for Coningsby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RÉCAMIER, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Madame </span><span class="font2">(whose maiden name was </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jeanne Françoise Julie Adelaide Bernard), </span><span class="font2">was born on 4th&nbsp;December 1777 at Lyons, and died at Paris on 11th May&nbsp;1849. She was married at fifteen to the banker Récamier,&nbsp;who was more than old enough to be her father. Beautiful,&nbsp;accomplished, with a real love for literature, she possessed&nbsp;at the same time a temperament which protected her from&nbsp;scandal, and from the early days of the consulate to almost&nbsp;the end of the July monarchy her salon was one of the&nbsp;chief resorts of literary and political society that pretended&nbsp;to fashion. For some time she was much under the influence of Madame de Staël, and it was partly through her&nbsp;that Madame Récamier became acquainted with Benjamin&nbsp;Constant, whose singular political tergiversations during&nbsp;the last days of the empire and the first of the restoration&nbsp;have been attributed to Madame Récamier. There is no&nbsp;doubt that she succeeded in inspiring a real and almost&nbsp;desperate passion in the heart of Constant, whose letters to&nbsp;her have had a singular fate, having been twice published&nbsp;in part, and twice interfered with by judicial proceedings&nbsp;on the part of the representatives of the parties concerned.&nbsp;In Madame Récamier’s later days she lost most of the fortune which, when she was the wife of a rich banker, had&nbsp;given her part of her consequence ; but she continued to&nbsp;receive visitors at the Abbaye-aux-Bois. Here Chateaubriand was a constant visitor, and in a manner master of&nbsp;the house ; but Madame Récamier never even in old age,&nbsp;ill-health, and reduced circumstances lost her attraction.&nbsp;After her death </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Souvenirs et Correspondances tirés des&nbsp;Papiers de Madame Récamier</span><span class="font2"> were published. To compile,&nbsp;however, a real account of her would necessitate the ransack&nbsp;of all the memoirs, correspondence, and anecdotage concerning French political and literary life for the first half&nbsp;of this century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECANATI, a city of Italy, in the province of Macerata, 17| miles from Loreto, on the highway between Ancona&nbsp;and Rome, is built on a hill 910 feet above the sea, and still&nbsp;retains portions of its 15th-century walls and gateways. It&nbsp;is now perhaps best known as the birthplace of the poet&nbsp;Leopardi, whose monument adorns the principal piazza and&nbsp;whose family has collected in the town a very interesting</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">museum of Leopardiana; but it also contains fine old mansions of the Leopardi, Mazzagalli, Massucci, and Car-radori in the main street, a palazzo coinmunale with a&nbsp;bronze representation of the removal of the Holy House to&nbsp;Loreto, and a Gothic cathedral, built towards the close of&nbsp;the 14tli century and dedicated to St Flavianus, patriarch&nbsp;of Constantinople. The population in 1881 was 8864 in&nbsp;the town and port (3040) and 19,524 in the commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recanati appears as a strong castle in the 10th century or earlier. Round this gathered a community whose petty wars with Osimo&nbsp;(Auximum) called for the interference of Innocent III. in 1198.&nbsp;From Frederick II. it obtained the right of having a port on the&nbsp;Adriatic; and by Gregory IX. it was made a city and the seat of the&nbsp;bishopric transferred from Osimo. This oscillation between Guelf&nbsp;and Gbibelline continued characteristic of Recanati. Urban IY.&nbsp;abolished the “city” and bishopric; Nicholas IV. restored them.&nbsp;John XXII. again, in 1320, removed the bishopric and placed the&nbsp;city under interdict. The interdict was withdrawn in 1328 on&nbsp;payment of a heavy fine, but the bishopric remained in abeyance&nbsp;till 1357. Gregory XII., who on his deposition by the council of&nbsp;Constance was made papal legate of the sees of Macerata and&nbsp;Recanati, died in this city in 1417. The assistance rendered by&nbsp;Recanati to the popes in their straggles with the Sforza seems to&nbsp;have exhausted its resources, and it began to decline. Considerable&nbsp;damage was done by the earthquake of 1741 ; and the French, who&nbsp;were twice in possession of the city in 1797, pillaged it in 1799.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECHABITES, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sons of Rechab, </span><span class="font2">in ancient Israel formed a sort of religious order in some respects analogous&nbsp;to the Nazarites, with whom they shared the rule of&nbsp;abstinence from wine. They went farther than the latter,&nbsp;however, in eschewing the luxuries and pursuits of settled&nbsp;life, living in tents and refusing to sow grain as well as&nbsp;to plant vineyards. Their origin must have been in&nbsp;northern Israel, for their “ father ” or founder, to whom&nbsp;they referred their rule of life, was that Jehonadab or&nbsp;Jonadab, son of Rechab, who lent his countenance to Jehu&nbsp;in the abolition of Tyrian Baal-worship (2 Kings x.). The&nbsp;order founded by Jehonadab must from its constitution&nbsp;have soon become a sort of hereditary clan, and as such&nbsp;the “house of Rechab” appears in Jer. xxxv., from which&nbsp;we learn that they had survived in Judah after the fall of&nbsp;the northern kingdom and continued to observe the ordinance of Jehonadab till the approach of Nebuchadnezzar&nbsp;drove them for protection into Jerusalem. Jeremiah promised them as a reward of their obedience that they should&nbsp;never lack a man to represent them (as a priest) before&nbsp;Jehovah. This perhaps is the origin of the later Jewish&nbsp;tradition that the Rechabites intermarried with the Levites&nbsp;and so entered the temple service.@@<sup>1</sup> Hegesippus in his&nbsp;account of the death of James the Just even speaks of&nbsp;Rechabite priests and makes one of them protest against&nbsp;the crime (Eus., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II.fi.,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 23).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RECOGNIZANCE, in law,, is, in the words of Black-stone, “ an obligation of record, entered into before some court or magistrate duly authorized, whereby the party&nbsp;bound acknowledges that he owes to the king or a private&nbsp;plaintiff (as the case may be) a certain sum of money, with&nbsp;condition to be void if he shall do some particular act,—&nbsp;as if he shall appear at the assizes, keep the peace, pay a&nbsp;certain debt, or the like.” The term itself means that the&nbsp;person bound </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recognizes</span><span class="font2"> the existence of a debt. Recognizance was at one time used as a security for money lent,&nbsp;something in the nature of a mortgage. In this sense it&nbsp;is practically obsolete, though it is alluded to in modern&nbsp;Acts of Parliament, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font2"> 27 and 28 Yict. c. 112, by which&nbsp;a recognizance entered into after 29th July 1864 does not&nbsp;bind the land until actual delivery in execution. The&nbsp;principal use of recognizances at the present day is in&nbsp;chancery and criminal procedure. In chancery recognizances are entered into as a form of security by certain</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> From the obscure passage 1 Chron. ii. 55 it would seem that in later times the Rechabites were regarded as Kenites.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
