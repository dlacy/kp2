<p><span class="font1">Rhodes’s scheme. The arrival at BuIawayo of Dr L. S. Jameson, who had previously attended Lobengula professionaIIy, and who&nbsp;strongly supported Rudd and his companions, appears to have&nbsp;been the factor which decided Lobengula to sign the concession.&nbsp;This concession once obtained, Rhodes proceeded with rapidity&nbsp;to prosecute his great enterprise. He extinguished the claims&nbsp;of earlier concessionaires by purchase (giving, for instance,&nbsp;£10,046 for the Baines and Swinburne grants), and united all&nbsp;interests in the British South Africa Company, with a share&nbsp;capital of £1,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Following the example of Sir George Goldie in West Africa and of Sir William Mackinnon in East Africa, Rhodes determined&nbsp;to apply to the British government for a charter for the newly&nbsp;formed company, whose original directors were, in addition to&nbsp;Rhodes and Beit, the duke of Abercorn, the duke of Fife, Lord&nbsp;Gifford, Albert (afterwards 4th earl) Grey and George Cawston.&nbsp;In applying for a charter (in April 1889) the founders of the&nbsp;company stated their objects tOj be the following: (1) To&nbsp;extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems in the&nbsp;direction of the Zambezi; (2) to encourage emigration and&nbsp;colonization; (3) to promote trade and commerce; (4) to&nbsp;develop and work minerals and other concessions under the&nbsp;management of one powerful organization, thereby obviating&nbsp;conflicts and complications between the various interests that&nbsp;had been acquired within these regions, and securing to the&nbsp;native chiefs and their subjects the rights reserved to them&nbsp;under the several concessions. In making this application the&nbsp;boundaries in which they proposed to work were purposely&nbsp;left somewhat vague. They were described to be the region&nbsp;of South Africa lying immediately north of British&nbsp;Bechuanaland, north and west of the South African&nbsp;Republic, and west of the Portuguese dominions on&nbsp;the east coast. The government, having ascertained&nbsp;the substantial nature of the company’s resources and the&nbsp;composition of the proposed directorate, and also that they&nbsp;were prepared to begin immediately the development of the&nbsp;country, granted the charter, dated the 29th of October 1889.&nbsp;From this date onward the company was commonly known as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ the Chartered Company.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few points in the charter itself deserve to be noted. In the first place, it gave considerable extension to the terms of&nbsp;the original concessions by Lobengula. In short, it transformed&nbsp;the rights of working minerals and metals, and preventing&nbsp;others from doing so, into rights practically sovereign over&nbsp;the regions in which the company’s activity was to be employed.&nbsp;These rights the crown granted directly itself, not merely confirming a previous grant from another source. By ArticIe X.&nbsp;the company was empowered to make ordinances (to be approved&nbsp;by the secretary of state), and to establish and maintain a force&nbsp;of police. A strict supervision was provided for, to be exercised&nbsp;by the secretary of state over the relations between the company&nbsp;and the natives. The British government reserved to itself&nbsp;entire power to repeal the charter at any time that it did not&nbsp;consider the company was fulfilling its obligations or endeavouring&nbsp;duIy to carry out the objects for which the charter was granted.&nbsp;The sphere of operations of the company was not stated with&nbsp;any greater precision than had been indicated in the application for the charter; but by agreements concluded with Germany&nbsp;in 1900, with Portflgal in 1891 and with the Congo State in&nbsp;1894, the international boundaries were at length defined (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Africa,</span><span class="font1"> § 5). The agreements, while they took the British&nbsp;sphere north to Lake Tanganyika, disappointed Rhodes in that&nbsp;they prevented the realization of the scheme he had formed&nbsp;by the time the charter was granted, namely, for securing a&nbsp;continuous strip of British territory from the Cape to Egypt—a&nbsp;scheme which was but an enlargement of his original conception&nbsp;as formulated in 1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much, however, had happened before the boundaries of the British sphere were fixed. While the railway from Cape Town&nbsp;was being continued northward as rapidly as possible, the&nbsp;determination was taken to occupy immediately part of the&nbsp;sphere assigned to the company, and AIashonaland was selected&nbsp;as not being in actual occupation by the MatabeIe but the home&nbsp;of more peaceful tribes. A pioneer force was sent up in June&nbsp;■1890 under Colonel Pennefather, consisting of five hundred&nbsp;mounted police and a few hundred pioneers. Accompanying&nbsp;this force as guide was the well-known traveller, F. C. Selous.&nbsp;The work of transport was attended with considerable difficulty,&nbsp;and roads had to be cut as the expedition advanced. Nevertheless, in a few months the expedition, without firing a shot,&nbsp;had reached the site of what is now the town of SaIisbury, and&nbsp;had also established on the Une of march small forts at Tuli,&nbsp;Victoria and Charter. Archibald Ross Colquhoun was chosen&nbsp;as the first administrator. He had not long been in office&nbsp;when, in May 1891, difficulties arose WiththePortuguese&nbsp;on their north-west frontier, both parties claiming a&nbsp;tract of territory in which a Portuguese trading station&nbsp;had been established. The result was a skirmish, in&nbsp;which a small company of British South Africa poUce&nbsp;were victorious. In 1891 Dr Jameson, who had joined&nbsp;the pioneer force, was appointed administrator in succession to&nbsp;CoIquhoun. The Boers for several years had been planning a&nbsp;settlement north of the Limpopo, and they now determined,&nbsp;in spite of the Moffat treaty and the British occupation, to carry&nbsp;out their object. An expedition known as the Banyailand Trek&nbsp;was organized under the leadership of CoIoneI Ferreira, and two&nbsp;large parties of Boers proceeded to the banks of the Limpopo.&nbsp;Information of the intended trek had been conveyed to Cape&nbsp;Town, and Sir Henry (afterwards Lord) Loch (the high commissioner) at once sent a strong protest to »President Kruger,&nbsp;lnforming him that any attempt to invade the Chartered&nbsp;Company’s territories would be an act of hostiUty against the&nbsp;British Crown; and Kruger issued a proclamation forbidding&nbsp;the trekkers to proceed. Aleanwhile, however, a party had&nbsp;already reached the Limpopo, where they were met by Jameson&nbsp;in command of the British South Africa Company’s forces.&nbsp;He told them that they would not be allowed to proceed except&nbsp;as private individuals, who might obtain farms on application to the Chartered Company. Colonel Ferreira was arrested&nbsp;and detained for a few days, and the expedition then broke&nbsp;up and dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pioneers, who were granted farms and mining claims, having been settled in Mashonaland, Rhodes recognized the&nbsp;extreme importance of giving the country a port nearer than&nbsp;that provided by Cape Town. On his initiative proposals were&nbsp;made to Portugal, and the treaty concluded in 1891 between&nbsp;Great Britain and Portugal provided that a railway might be&nbsp;built from Beira in Portuguese territory to SaUsbury, on condition that Portugal received a duty not exceeding 3% on the&nbsp;value of the goods imported. The treaty further stipulated&nbsp;for the free navigation of the Zambezi and the construction of&nbsp;telegraphs. Prospecting operations were at once started, and&nbsp;various gold mines were discovered containing traces of old&nbsp;workings. Fresh gold reefs were also opened up. The prospects&nbsp;of the country seemed promising, and although a good deal of&nbsp;.fever occurred in the low-lying valleys under the conditions&nbsp;of camp life, the health of the community soon improved as&nbsp;more suitable habitations were erected. In two years a white&nbsp;population of 3000 people had settled in the newly opened&nbsp;country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though the company was now free from internationaI rivalry it was soon faced by serious native trouble. The first&nbsp;pioneers had deUberately chosen Alashonaland as their place&nbsp;of settlement. Ever since the advent of AlosiUkatze north of&nbsp;the Limpopo the unfortunate AIashonas had been the prey of&nbsp;the Matabele; they therefore readily accepted the British&nbsp;occupation. The MatabeIe, however, were loth to abandon their&nbsp;predatory excursions among the Alashonas, and in July 1893&nbsp;a large </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">impi</span><span class="font1"> (native force) was sent into Alashonaland, and&nbsp;entered not onIy native kraals, but also the streets of the new&nbsp;township of Victoria. An attempt was made to preserve the&nbsp;peace, but it was evident from the attitude taken by the Alatabele&nbsp;that nothing short of the authority which only superior force&nbsp;could command would settle the question. The AIatabeIe were</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
