<p><span class="font2">as moveable round </span><span class="font1">the point G by mean« of </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">pin at right angles to the axis. Suppoſe the balls paſſing&nbsp;through the ſituations A and B ; their centrifugal forces&nbsp;urge them at the ſame time in the directions CA and&nbsp;OB, which impulſions conſpire to make the connecting&nbsp;rod recede from both ends of the axis D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font1"> And thus&nbsp;the balls, inſtead of deſeribing parallel circles round this&nbsp;axis, will deſcribe parallel ſpirals, gradually opening the&nbsp;angles DGA, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> GB more and more, till the balls acquire the poſition « </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> at right angles to the axis. They&nbsp;will not </span><span class="font0">ſtop </span><span class="font1">there, for </span><span class="font2">tach </span><span class="font1">came into that poſition&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">v⅜h </span><span class="font1">an oblique motion. They will paſs it ; and were&nbsp;it not for the reſiſtance of the air and the friction of&nbsp;the joint at G, they would go on till the ball A came&nbsp;to deſcribe the circle BHK, and the ball B to deſcribe&nbsp;the circle AEF. The centrifugal forces will now have&nbsp;exhauſted by oppoſition all the motions wſhich they had&nbsp;acquired during their paſſage from the poſition AB to&nbsp;the poſition </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>x</sup> IL</span><span class="font1"> and now they will again deſcribe ſpirals gradually opening, and then contracting, till the&nbsp;balls arrive at their original poſition AB, when the proceſs will begin again. Thus they will continue a kind&nbsp;of oſeillating rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the axis is continually changing with reſpect </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font1">the ſyſtem of balls ; but it is fixed in reſpect to abſolute ſpace, becauſe the axis D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> is ſupported. It does&nbsp;not yet appear that it has any tendency to change its&nbsp;poſition, becauſe the centrifugal tendency of the balls&nbsp;is completely yielded to by the joint at G. The material axis has indeed ſuftained no change ; but the real&nbsp;axis, or mathematical line round which the rotation was&nbsp;going on every moment, has been continually ſhiſting&nbsp;its place. This is not ſo obvious, and requires a more&nbsp;attentive conſideration. To ſhow accurately the gradual change of poſition of the real axis of rotation&nbsp;would require a long diſcuſſion We ſhall content&nbsp;ourſelves wn’tſh exhibiting a caſe where the poſition of&nbsp;the momentary axis is unqueſtionably different from&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dd,</span><span class="font1"> which we may ſuppoſe horizontal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Take the balls in the poſition « </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">β∙</span><span class="font1"> They came into this poſition with a ſpiral motion, and therefore each&nbsp;of them was moving obliquely to <sup>t</sup>he tangents </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">*r,βγ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">to the circle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">afβt,</span><span class="font1"> ſuppoſe in the directions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a6,βκ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">They are therefore moving round the centre G in a&nbsp;plane </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">0aβκ,</span><span class="font1"> inclined to the plane </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;t<sup>i</sup>&lt;*-βy</span><span class="font1"> of the circle&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aSβι.</span><span class="font1"> The momentary axis of rotation is therefore&nbsp;perpendicular to this oblique plane, and therefore does&nbsp;not coincide with D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We cannot enter upon the inveſtigation oſ this eva-gation of the axis, although the ſubject is both curious and important to the ſpeculative mathematicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A knowledge of it is abſolutely neceffary to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">complete </span><span class="font1">ſolution of the great ' problem of the preceſſion. But&nbsp;when treating that article, we contented ourſelves with&nbsp;ſhowing that the evagation which obtains in this natural phenomenon is ſo exceedingly minute, that although&nbsp;multiplied many thouſands of times, it would eſeape&nbsp;the niceft obſervations of modern aſtronomers; and that&nbsp;it is a thing which does not accumulate beyond a certain limit, much too ſmall for obſervation, and then ,&nbsp;diminiſhes again, and is periodical. Euler, D’Alembert, Frifi, and De la Grange, have ſhown the momentary poſition of the real variable axis correſponding&nbsp;to any given time ; and Landen has with great ingenuity and elegance connected theſe momentary pofi∙</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">fitιons, and given the whole paths </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">evagation. Mr Segnor was, we believe, the firſt who ſhowed (in a&nbsp;Diſſertation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Mοtu Turbinuιn<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1"> Halle, 1755)» that in&nbsp;every body there were at leaſt three lines paſſing&nbsp;through the centre of gravity at right angles to each&nbsp;other, forming the ſolid angle of a cube, round which&nbsp;the centrifugal forces were accurately balanced, and&nbsp;therefore a rotation begun round either of theſe three&nbsp;lines would be continued, and they are permanent&nbsp;axes of rotation. Albert Euler gave the firſt de-monſtration in 1760, and ſince that time the inveſtigation of theſe axes has been extended and improved&nbsp;by the different authors already named. It is an exceedingly difficult ſubject; and w<sup>r</sup>e recommend the ſyn-thetical inveſtigation by Frifi in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coſmographia</span><span class="font1"> as the&nbsp;fitteſt for inſtructing a curious reader to whom the ſubject is new. We ſhall conclude this diſſertation with&nbsp;a beautiful theorem, the enunciation of which we owe&nbsp;to P. Frifi, which has amazingly improved the whole&nbsp;theory, and gives eaſy and elegant ſolutions of the&nbsp;moſt difficult problems. It is analogous to Qιe great&nbsp;theorem of the compofition of motions and forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If a body turns round an axis AGa (fig. 17.) paſſing through its centre of gravity G with the angular velocity α, while this axis is carried round another&nbsp;axis BGi with the angular velocity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> and if GD be&nbsp;taken to GK as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> (the points B and E being taken on that fide of the centre wſhere they are moving&nbsp;towards the ſame fide of the plane of the figure), and&nbsp;the line DE be drawn, though the whole and every&nbsp;particle of the body will be in a ſtate of rotation round&nbsp;a third axis CGf, lying in the plane of the other two,&nbsp;and parallel to DE, and the angular velocity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> round&nbsp;this axis will be to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> and to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> as DE is to GD and to&nbsp;GE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For, let P be any particle oſ the body, and ſuppoſe a ſpherical ſurface to be deſeribed round G paſſing&nbsp;through P. Draw PR perpendicular to the plane of&nbsp;the figure. It is evident that PR is the common ſection of the circle of rotation IP/’ round the axis A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the circle KPZ of rotation round the axis Bi. Let&nbsp;I ∕, Ki be the diameters of theſe circles of rotation,&nbsp;F and G their centres. Draw the radii PF and PO,&nbsp;and the tangents PM and PN. Theſe tangents&nbsp;are in a plane MPN which touches the ſphere in&nbsp;P, and cuts the plane of the axis in a line MN, to&nbsp;wſhich a line drawn from the .centre G of the ſphere&nbsp;through the point R is perpendicular. Let PN repreſent the velocity oſ rotation of the point P round&nbsp;the axis Bi, and P</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font1"> its velocity of rotation round Am&nbsp;Complete the parallelogram PNi∕. Then Pi is the&nbsp;direction and velocity of motion reſulting from the&nbsp;compofition of PN and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pſ.

<p><span class="font1">Let perpendiculars∕F, zT, be drawn to the plane of the axes, and the parallelogram PN(∕^will be orthθτ&nbsp;graphically projected on that plane, its projection being </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">parallelogram RNTF. ( F here falls on the centre by acci-,&nbsp;dent). Draw the diagonal RT. It is evident that the&nbsp;plane PR/T is perpendicular to the plane of the two axes,&nbsp;becauſe PR is ſo. Therefore the compound motion&nbsp;Pi is in the plane of a circle of revolution round ſome&nbsp;axis ſituated in the plane of the other two. Therefore produce TR, and draw GC cutting it aſ right</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
